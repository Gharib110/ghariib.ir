The Azure DevOps Demo Generator is a tool that allows you to create projects in your Azure DevOps organization, complete with pre-filled sample content. This includes source code, work items, iterations, service connections, and build and release pipelines, all based on a template you select.

Starting **February 28, 2025**, we are eliminating the need for us to authenticate on your behalf. This update will give you greater control over creating new projects and ensure a more secure process. Instead of the previous authentication process, you will run the ADOGenerator project as a console application or executable (.exe) file to create projects in your Azure DevOps organization.

The application is now available for you to try, so feel free to dive in and experience the new process today. To learn how to run the application, check out the steps outlined in the AzDevOpsDemoGenerator repo. If you encounter any issues, please let us know by creating an issue here.
