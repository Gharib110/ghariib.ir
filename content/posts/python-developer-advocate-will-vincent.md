Hi, I’m a new Python Developer Advocate, focusing especially on web development. If you have any questions or want to share ideas around JetBrains products, most notably PyCharm, say hi at william.vincent@jetbrains.com.

**Background**

I’m a former Django Board Member and the author of three books on Django. Since 2019, I’ve co-hosted the Django Chat podcast and co-written the weekly Django News newsletter while also maintaining several open-source projects, including the awesome-django and Lithium starter project repos. These days most of my new content is found on LearnDjango.com, which has a growing list of free tutorials and premium courses.

I love learning and teaching, so if you attend a Python conference, you might see me give a talk. Before focusing on web development in Python, I worked at multiple early-stage startups, including Quizlet, and taught a course on Web Development at Williams College.

**What I’ll Be Doing**

I’ll be attending a number of conferences this year, including DjangoCon Europe, DjangoCon US, PyCon US, EuroPython, and PyTorch. Come say hi if you see me there.

I’m working on several open tickets around core Django as well as its official documentation.

And I’m excited to learn more about data science this year, exploring ways that it can (or should) overlap with web development, so be on the lookout for future videos, blog posts, and more from me in this area.

**What Interests/Excites Me About the Role**

I’ve worked with JetBrains for years as a Django Board Member. Their annual fundraiser is the single biggest contributor to the Django Software Foundation Budget. And the annual Django Developers Survey, which I started up, is now run in conjunction with JetBrains, who helps with the formatting and data analysis. In short, JetBrains is a long-time partner in the open-source community and continues to be.

As a Developer Advocate, I will continue to teach what I learn about Python, web development, and data science to the community. Now is a particularly exciting moment as new AI features make their way into text editors and IDEs. There is a lot to figure out around how developers can properly benefit from these tools.

**Fun Facts**

- I met my wife at the University of St. Andrews, where I lived in the same dorm as Prince William and Kate.

- I was a Book Editor before switching into tech

- I’m a longtime Liverpool FC supporter
