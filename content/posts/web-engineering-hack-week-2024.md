At Canonical, the work of our teams is strongly embedded in the open source principles and philosophy. We believe open source software will become the most prevalent method of software development and delivery in the future. Being open source is more than making the source of your software available, it’s also about contributing to other open source projects and helping to build communities. With this in mind, the web engineering team recently had the privilege of dedicating a week solely to contribute to external open source projects. We do this every year. 

Anyone who has tried to contribute to open-source projects will know that the journey is full of challenges, from finding an issue with enough context to understand the expected change, to getting the software running locally to test changes and much more. We would like to draw more attention to these issues and find sound practices to iron these out at an industry level. This is an ambitious goal, so first, we need to walk the walk.

Here is a list of contributions performed by the team during the week:

The goal of the initiative is to better understand what makes an open source project accessible to external contributors. This is a great opportunity to experience big and small projects. Projects with different cultural personalities. Build up some tips and tricks on how to run good projects and apply them to ours. This is a source of pride for the team by encouraging us to help projects going forward. 

Open source encourages compatibility with standards, making locking users in more difficult. This is why we love the freedom open source offers. Open source software allows for sharing knowledge, gaining knowledge, and practising. It promotes transparency in data collection and software systems. Freedom, therefore, is the gift that keeps on giving.

Please take a look at our open-source projects and reach out to us via the issues if anything is unclear.
