At the heart of every smart factory initiative lies a desire for transformation — production that's not just more efficient, but fundamentally better. Yet according to Capgemini, nearly 60% of manufacturers struggle to scale beyond pilot projects, finding themselves in what McKinsey calls "pilot purgatory" — that frustrating space between successful small-scale tests and full-scale transformation.

The key to breaking free from pilot purgatory lies in the foundation of smart manufacturing: infrastructure. For manufacturers pushing to innovate and stay competitive, the technical challenges are clear. Success demands robust infrastructure that can handle automation, process real-time data, and run sophisticated AI workloads. Yet as Gartner notes, "Technology or solution immaturity is much less of a challenge than many might expect." What matters more is how this infrastructure enables people to work together, make decisions, and drive change across the organization.

### **The Giant Swarm Smart Factory Platform: infrastructure built for scale and success**

Our platform provides what modern manufacturing infrastructure needs — a secure, scalable, and resilient foundation that integrates seamlessly into your existing environment. From edge locations across data centers to cloud accounts, we deliver a consistent platform that lets your team focus on driving business value while we manage the underlying complexity.

### **Key benefits for platform teams:**

#### **1\. Accelerate time to market with production-ready infrastructure**

Traditional infrastructure rollouts can take years. Our platform gets you operational in weeks, enabling rapid deployment of critical manufacturing workloads. This means your platform team can quickly implement predictive maintenance systems, real-time production optimization, and AI-driven process improvements. Instead of building infrastructure from scratch, your team can focus on enabling the innovations that drive manufacturing forward.

#### **2\. Unified platform operations across all locations**

Manufacturing environments often suffer from "island solutions" — isolated systems creating operational overhead and data silos. Our platform eliminates these inefficiencies by providing a single, scalable foundation that works across all your factories. This unified approach ensures consistent platform operations and seamless data flow from edge to cloud, with centralized visibility and control. When teams across different locations can work together seamlessly, transformation happens naturally.

#### **3\. Edge processing for performance and cost optimization**

Smart manufacturing generates massive data volumes that don't all need to hit your central systems. Our platform's edge processing capabilities reduce bandwidth costs and latency by processing data closer to the source. This becomes crucial for time-sensitive operations like robotics, automated quality control, and predictive maintenance — where every millisecond counts and decisions need to happen in real-time.

#### **4\. Focus on manufacturing innovation, not infrastructure management**

Your platform team's expertise is better spent on manufacturing initiatives than managing infrastructure. We operate the platform as an extension of your team, reducing both operational burden and cognitive load. This frees your engineers to focus on high-impact projects — IoT integration, machine learning workloads, and advanced analytics. While your team drives innovation in manufacturing processes, we ensure the infrastructure runs smoothly behind the scenes.

#### **5\. Enterprise-grade security and compliance**

Manufacturing infrastructure demands comprehensive security. Our platform implements robust protection at every layer — edge, data center, and cloud. This systematic approach ensures compliance with industry standards while protecting sensitive operations and intellectual property through consistent security practices. Your entire manufacturing infrastructure remains secure without sacrificing performance or flexibility.

### **A partnership built on trust**

We go beyond traditional support by actively operating the platform, carrying the pager, and resolving issues proactively. Our team monitors platform health, identifies potential problems before they impact your manufacturing operations, and ensures continuous, reliable production. As one of our training participants put it, we're more than just a provider — "we are friends who collaborate on building something cool together". This partnership approach means your platform team can confidently support manufacturing operations without bearing the full operational burden.

### **Designed for transformation**

The Giant Swarm Smart Factory Platform does more than simplify infrastructure management — it enables true transformation. Through reduced complexity, proactive operations, and seamless integration across all factory locations, your smart factory initiatives can scale with confidence. Our robust foundation handles the technical challenges, creating an environment where your team feels empowered to drive meaningful change.
