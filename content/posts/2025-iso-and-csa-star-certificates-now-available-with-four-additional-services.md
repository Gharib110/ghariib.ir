Amazon Web Services (AWS) successfully completed an onboarding audit with no findings for ISO 9001:2015, 27001:2022, 27017:2015, 27018:2019, 27701:2019, 20000-1:2018, and 22301:2019, and Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v4.0. EY CertifyPoint auditors conducted the audit and reissued the certificates on February 19, 2025. The objective was to assess the level of compliance with the requirements of the applicable international standards.

We’ve added four additional AWS services to the audit scope since the last certification issued on November 29, 2024. These are the four additional services:

- Amazon Q Developer
- Amazon Application Recovery Controller
- AWS B2B Data Interchange
- Amazon Verified Permissions
