At VirusTotal, we're constantly exploring new ways to make threat intelligence more digestible and available to a wider audience. Our latest effort leverages the power of AI to create easily understood audio discussions from technical information.

Using Google NotebookLM's innovative Audio Overview feature, we're transforming technical content into accessible audio experiences to make threat intelligence engaging and understandable for everyone. Instead of just reading, now you can listen and learn about complex cybersecurity concepts, no matter your level of expertise.

Our first AI-generated conversation is based on two blog posts (1, 2) where we previously discussed how Google's Gemini AI is being utilized for analyzing suspicious binaries. It's a meta experience, to be sure: Gemini, discussing its own role in analyzing malware. Listen to the full conversation below:
