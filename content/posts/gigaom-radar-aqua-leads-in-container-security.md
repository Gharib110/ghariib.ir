![GigaOm Radar: Aqua Leads in Container Security](https://blog.aquasec.com/hubfs/featured-gigaom-container-security-2025-blog-main-1200x628.jpg)

Securing containerized applications demands a multi-layered strategy that spans the entire lifecycle from development to production, a challenge Aqua has spent nearly a decade mastering. Aquaâ€™s Container Security solution provides full lifecycle protection by identifying vulnerabilities early in the build phase, integrating acceptance gates in the CI/CD pipeline to minimize risks, and offering real-time runtime protection in production environments. With the Aqua Platform, organizations can secure container workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, stop attacks as they happen, and maintain compliance, all without slowing development.
