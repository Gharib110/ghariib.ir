**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-23963  
**Published :** Jan. 31, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 1 day, 3 hours ago  
**Description :** This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the PBAP\_DecodeVCARD function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.  
**Severity:** 8.8 | HIGH
