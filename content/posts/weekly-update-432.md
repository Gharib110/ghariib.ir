There's a certain irony to the Bluesky situation where people are pushing back when I include links to X. Now, where have we seen this sort of behaviour before? ðŸ¤” When I'm relying on content that only appears on that platform to add context to a data breach in HIBP _and_ that content is freely accessible from within the native Bluesky app (without needing an X account), we're out of reasonable excuses for the negativity. And if "because Elon" is the sole reason and someone is firm enough in their convictions on that, there's a very easy solution ðŸ™‚
