Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 20, 2024

Jason Lau, CISO at Singapore-based Crypto.com, one of the world’s biggest crypto trading platforms with 100 million users across 90 countries, told Cybercrime Magazine Podcast host David Braue that there were around 40,000 people at the recent Black Hat Middle East & Africa Conference held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Nov. 24-26.

Lau, one of Black Hat’s featured speakers, explained that the event was recognized by Guinness World Records for the most ethical hackers – more than 1,000 – at a single hackathon or capture the flag competition.

Black Hat MEA 2024 brought together cybersecurity professionals, cutting-edge technologies, solution providers, and decision-makers from around the world, condensing several months of networking into just three days.

Lau also spoke to us about Crypto.com’s whopping $2 million bug bounty program, the largest one ever offered by HackerOne. Let’s see if that makes it into Guinness World Records!
