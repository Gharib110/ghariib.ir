According to information from our intelligence network, ICA is working on a secret project. We need to find out what the project is. Once you have the access information, send them to us. We will place a backdoor to access the system later. You just focus on what the project is. You will probably have to go through several layers of security. The Agency has full confidence that you will successfully complete this mission. Good Luck, Agent!
