# Srsly Risky Biz Outside America Musks X is a foreign influence threat

<br/>

<br/>
Tom Uren and Patrick Gray discuss how X is actively engaging in political interference outside the US. The risks mirror those of TikTok. American legislators moved against TikTok because it could potentially be a powerful tool for the Chinese government to interfere with American political discourse. X is a realised threat, not a potential one, so we expect that foreign governments will start to consider a ban.

They also explore why mass firing of probationary employees in NSA and intelligence agencies is particularly damaging.
