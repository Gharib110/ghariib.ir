Upscayl, the popular free open-source AI image upscaler, announced new 2.15 released at Christmas!

The release improved user experience for enlarging and enhancing low-resolution images by new AI module and improved module selection dialog.

Upscayl – AI mode selection dialog

The modules now include Upscayl Standard, Upscayl Lite, Remacri, Ultramix, Uptrasharp, Digital Art and the **new High Fidelity**. Each module has a preview image before and after upscale, and short description about which case it’s suitable for.

Since the new 2.15 release, the app now **supports multiple languages**. So far, they include English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese (Simple).

At the first launch of the application, it now shows a welcome screen, allowing user to choose the app language, theme, and few other options. And, it also includes a short video teaching users how to get started.
