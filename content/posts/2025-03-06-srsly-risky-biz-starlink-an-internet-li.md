# Srsly Risky Biz Starlink an internet lifeline for pig butchering compounds

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray discuss how Starlink is providing an internet lifeline for scam compounds that have had their internet access cut by Thai authorities. Starlink has a very poor track record dealing with unauthorised use, but it is time for the company to develop the processes to keep on top of these problems.

They also discuss how President Trump’s actions that favour Russia will make Five Eyes partners take stock, particularly when it comes to HUMINT intelligence sharing.

Finally they examine the did-it-happen-or-not stand-down of US Cyber Command’s Russian operations.
