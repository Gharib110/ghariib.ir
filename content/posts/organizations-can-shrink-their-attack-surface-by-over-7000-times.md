Sausalito, Calif. – Mar. 5, 2025

“If Global Cybercrime Inc. traded on a stock exchange, I would buy it because its growth trajectory over the past decade has been breathtaking,” writes Steven Ellliott, an executive at ADAMnetworks. “Measured by GDP, global cybercrime is now a $10.5 trillion-per-year economy, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, trailing only the U.S. and China in economic productivity.”

Elliott, author of “War Story“, a memoir, an explosive look at the chaos of war―and the battle for life in its aftermath, adds in his Security InfoWatch article, that “with over one billion unique URLs on the internet, thirteen million new malicious domains discovered monthly and more than 70 percent of traffic used for malicious purposes, the attack surface for organizations has reached unprecedented levels.”

Why remain on a battlefield dominated by adversaries when we can reshape the terrain entirely?, Elliott asks. The solution is simple: stop fighting the cyber war on the adversary’s terms, he answers. Elliott makes a business case for attack surface reduction, and he advocates a strategy to win the cyber war by demanding a shift from defending against every conceivable threat to proactively reducing exposure.

By focusing exclusively on “known good” connections and blocking all others, organizations can shrink their attack surface by over 7,000 times. This approach removes countless entry points for attackers, forcing them to expend more resources for diminishing returns.
