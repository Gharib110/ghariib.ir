**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-21628  
**Published :** Jan. 9, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 19 hours, 37 minutes ago  
**Description :** Chatwoot is a customer engagement suite. Prior to 3.16.0, conversation and contact filters endpoints did not sanitize the input of query\_operator passed from the frontend or the API. This provided any actor who is authenticated, an attack vector to run arbitrary SQL within the filter query by adding a tautological WHERE clause. This issue is patched with v3.16.0. 
**Severity:** 9.1 | CRITICAL
