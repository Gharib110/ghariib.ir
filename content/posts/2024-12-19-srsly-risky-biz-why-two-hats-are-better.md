# Srsly Risky Biz Why two hats are better than two heads

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about the likelihood that the incoming Trump administration will end the ‘dual-hat’ arrangement where a single officer leads both US Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. This would result in Cyber Command outranking NSA and could prioritise cyber disruption operations over intelligence collection. That would be a bad outcome.

They also talk about how changes to SEC disclosure rules have led to an outpouring of corporate drivel and how WhatsApp became an everything app.
