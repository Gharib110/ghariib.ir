# Srsly Risky Biz Why America needs its own Salt Typhoon

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about the idea of launching a retaliatory campaign to hack Chinese telcos in response to Salt Typhoon’s targeting of US ones. US Senator Mark Warner floated the idea as a way to persuade the Chinese government to pull back Salt Typhoon, but we think that kind of campaign has merit regardless.

They also discuss how Samoa’s CERT calling out APT40 is a big deal. It’s striking to see a small country of 200,000 people calling out Chinese hacking.
