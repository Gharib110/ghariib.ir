With so many interconnected devices in business and at home, cybersecurity isn’t just a line item on IT budgets – it’s a necessity for corporations, governments and individuals alike.

This is where HACK Global Cybersecurity ETF comes into focus. HACK offers investors exposure to a portfolio of leading global cybersecurity companies, including innovators like Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike and Fortinet. These firms are at the forefront of protecting critical infrastructure, sensitive data and digital systems from ever-evolving threats.

Data from Cybersecurity Ventures suggests the global cost of cybercrime could top $10.5 trillion USD this year alone, and spending on cybersecurity products and services were estimated to top $1.75 trillion USD cumulatively from 2021 to 2025. Demand for these services is likely to grow further.

Whether it’s securing cloud platforms, combating ransomware or safeguarding connected devices, the companies within HACK are addressing challenges that impact every industry.

Betashares reports that HACK recently achieved the milestone of reaching $1 billion in assets under management, a testament to cybersecurity being a key theme within the wider technology sector.
