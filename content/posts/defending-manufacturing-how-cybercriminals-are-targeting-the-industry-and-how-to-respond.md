- **Cyber Threats in Manufacturing:** The 2025 Trustwave Risk Radar Report highlights how cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in manufacturing infrastructure, workers, and digital supply chains, with over 3,500 critical vulnerabilities listed on CISA's KEV list.
- **Top Manufacturing Cyber Risks:** Attackers leverage high-profile exploits like **CVE-2014-0160** **(Heartbleed),** CVE-2021-40438 (Apache SSRF), and CVE-2024-4577 (PHP RCE) to disrupt production and steal sensitive data.
- **Proactive Cyber Defense Strategies:** Manufacturers must implement regular vulnerability management, network security enhancements (firewalls, IDS/IPS), and strict access controls (MFA, RBAC) to mitigate risks and protect operations.

As noted in the just-released Trustwave SpiderLabs report, 2025 Trustwave Risk Radar Report: Manufacturing Sector, modern manufacturing systems are increasingly interconnected, creating fertile ground for cybercriminals.
