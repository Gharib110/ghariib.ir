Imagine your organization's cyber defenses as a well-trained emergency response team. (Work with us here). Just like a strong immune system in a healthy body can fight off infections or the same defensive posture will snap into place in a well trained police unit, **Cyber Resilience in the Human Landscape** means the ability for every person in your organization to be prepared to act swiftly and effectively when cyber threats arise. We think the real magic to this lies not just in the technology but in the behavioral and psychological realm. How quickly and efficiently your people can respond is a question of knowledge, mindset, procedure, behavior, and culture.Â
