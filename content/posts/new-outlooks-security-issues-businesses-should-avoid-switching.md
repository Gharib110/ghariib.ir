Microsoft's "new Outlook" (introduced in 2022) has been promoted as an upgrade, but its implementation introduces severe data protection concerns - so severe that it's fair to say it's a downgrade rather than an upgrade. Regardless, Microsoft increasingly pushes personal and business Outlook users to switch to the new Outlook.

This poses significant compliance issues, especially for businesses handling sensitive data.
