## Support for uv package management

Take your environment management to the next level with uv integration in PyCharm. Create new environments from scratch or use a new environment type option to apply uv to existing ones. Additionally, when importing projects from version control, enjoy the flexibility to choose between `venv` and `uv` as your virtual environment manager.

## Flame graph visualization \[PyCharm Professional\]

You can now quickly find out where your code spends most of its execution time. Flame graphs display the application call tree, allowing you to check how long each call takes in the entire snapshot or in the call’s direct parent. You can even set a threshold, search for specific methods, and zoom the graph to focus on it.

## Quick-fix: Install missing packages from PyPI

If a package is not available in the default Conda repository, PyCharm now throws an error message and gives you the option to install the missing package from PyPI. You can either select _Install from PyPI_ and proceed as normal or _Abort Installation_ if you prefer to take a different route.
