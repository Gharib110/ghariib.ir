The feature had been around for ages, too.

If you've ever been stumped on what a word means in a Microsoft Word document, Smart Lookup always has your back. The handy tool makes it really easy to look up definitions of a word and also powers the software's thesaurus feature to find more ways to express what you're saying. If you get a lot of use out of Smart Lookup, I'm afraid to say that Microsoft is now getting rid of it, and you may not like what comes next.
