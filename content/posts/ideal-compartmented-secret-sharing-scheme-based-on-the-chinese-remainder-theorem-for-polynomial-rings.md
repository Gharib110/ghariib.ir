ePrint Report: **Ideal Compartmented Secret Sharing Scheme Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Polynomial Rings**  
_Alexandru-Valentin Basaga, Sorin Iftene_

A secret sharing scheme starts with a secret and then derives from it certain shares (or shadows) which are distributed to users. The secret may be recovered only by certain predetermined groups. In case of compartmented secret sharing, the set of users is partitioned into compartments and the secret can be recovered only if the number of participants from any compartment is greater than or equal to a fixed compartment threshold and the total number of participants is greater than or equal to a global threshold.  
  
In this paper we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Polynomial Rings in order to construct an ideal compartmented secret sharing scheme, inspired by the work from \[20\].
