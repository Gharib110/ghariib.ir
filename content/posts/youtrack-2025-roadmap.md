## Our commitment to you

We remain fully committed, as we have been all these years, to developing YouTrack as a platform that evolves with your needs. Our promise to you is to ensure that YouTrack continues to be available in both Server and Cloud versions, giving you the freedom to choose the hosting option that best fits your organization and data governance policies.

## Learning from experience as teams choose YouTrack

YouTrack is growing faster than ever, with a double-digit percentage increase in the customer base over the last year. We see adoption increasing in various team functions across small and medium enterprises. Together with our consulting partners, we work closely to help the largest enterprises with thousands of employees migrate their processes to YouTrack.

We know how tough it is to find the right project management tools – so many are out there! Teams often spend months exploring solutions to find the one that fits their needs.

Many teams switch to YouTrack to save costs without losing functionality or to find a server solution suitable for teams of a few to several hundred employees. Others transition from lightweight tools or development-specific issue-tracking platforms to gain more flexibility for growing teams and to bring various departments to work together. Some are just beginning their journey, moving from email or chat-based coordination to smart solutions like YouTrack that can support the existing business flows.

After adopting YouTrack, many teams have shared invaluable feedback, shaping our immediate priorities for 2025 and our roadmap for the future. Still, we remain flexible with our planning, leaving room to respond to your needs while staying true to our long-term vision and commitment to YouTrack as a flexible and powerful solution.

## A bold new design for YouTrack

### The big step in 2025

We’ll start 2025 with a bold new look and feel for YouTrack, introducing changes that reflect years of learning and exploration into how teams work on projects.

**New navigation panel**

The main menu will move from the top to the left side of the screen, accommodating the growing number of features and pages in YouTrack. We aim to make all the YouTrack key sections more accessible, reducing clicks and making navigation faster for all users. Starting in early 2025, the new navigation panel will be enabled by default for all users. While you will temporarily have the option to switch back to the old one in version 2025.1, we recommend embracing the new interface as we hope it will become the standard by midyear.

**Project hierarchy path for tasks, tickets, and articles**

This project-centric hierarchy will provide clickable breadcrumb paths for tasks, tickets, and articles, allowing you to navigate through project-related information effortlessly. For example, if you’re part of a design team contributing to a specific project, you will only ever be a couple of clicks away from any of the tasks and articles related to your design project.

**Redesigned _Issues_ page**

One of the main differences between YouTrack Lite and Classic has been the layout of the _Issues_ page. This meant that if you had a layout preference, your choice between YouTrack Lite and Classic was restricted. You don’t need to worry about that anymore! The unified _Issues_ page will eliminate the need to choose between Classic and Lite, combining their capabilities into a unified experience. It will include customizable settings, allowing you to tailor your task list to a table or list view with as much or as little detail as you need. We’re also working to improve the way you can search and filter tasks. Once implemented, this redesign will be the default, and there will not be an option to revert it.

### Further UX improvements for everyone

Later in 2025 and beyond, we will focus on expanding and enriching the new design with:

- **Revamped project pages** for teams to stay connected to their work context.

- **Advanced project-centric navigation** to keep you in your project’s context when needed.

- **A** **_My Work_** **page** with a personalized view designed to help you focus on your tasks and priorities.

- **Onboarding for new users** to guide them more easily through YouTrack’s features and help them be productive from day one.

## AI assistance for team members and managers

We’re dedicating resources to delivering AI automation features for team members and their project managers. The free AI assistance that comes out of the box in YouTrack will be enhanced with options that are useful in daily work.

- **Let AI complete content for you**. We are improving AI’s ability to suggest text completions, making drafting tasks or updates faster and more intuitive.

- **Task field suggestions from AI.** Intelligent suggestions for completing fields in your tasks can streamline work and help you provide critical details effortlessly in no time.

- **Future AI capabilities.** Looking ahead, we are working hard to implement the AI-based automation of your routine at a new level. We want to make it possible for you to start your day by reviewing the jobs done for you by AI agents and approving suggestions for moving forward with your projects, either in YouTrack or in the other connected systems.

## Expanding Helpdesk for internal and B2B support teams

While our Helpdesk solution currently allows standard users to be contributors when they are involved in helping your support teams with customer tickets, our customer feedback has highlighted another important scenario – **internal helpdesk projects.** In these cases, standard users also need to be able to act as reporters in internal helpdesk or service desk setups. To address this, we will also focus on improving the user interface for tickets submitted by internal reporters, improving email notifications for internal reporters, ensuring proper visibility and comment settings for users, and resolving other issues related to ticket visibility and comments for such a scenario.

Our long-term goal with the Helpdesk solution is to introduce advanced capabilities for separating and managing client organizations within it. This will enable B2B support teams to provide tailored experiences for different clients.

## More flexibility for project managers

### Planning canvas

We’re working on introducing a planning canvas to make project planning more visual and collaborative. This feature will allow teams to start working using a whiteboard-style interface where ideas can be drafted and transformed into actionable tasks with just a few clicks. Teams will also be able to move existing tasks to the canvas for better visualization and interactive adjustments.

### Customized naming for tasks

Would you like to call your tasks something other than “issues”? You may want to call them “documents” for legal projects, “purchase orders” for finance ones, or “jobs” or “employees” for HR and recruitment workflows. We’re continuing to work on a feature that will give you the flexibility to tailor the naming and structure of your entries when starting a specific project.

## More apps for your teams

YouTrack apps already allow you to add significant functionality, including entire new pages. For example, the Diagram Editor app lets teams create and manage visual diagrams directly within YouTrack.

We are committed to further supporting our partners and customers in building apps. If you have an idea for a new app or feature, feel free to contact us – we’d love to collaborate and discuss how we can help.

## Extended enterprise features

In relation to **YouTrack** **Server**, for our large enterprise customers, we plan to introduce more tools to help you monitor database performance and manage workloads effectively. These updates will help teams ensure stability and optimize resource usage as they scale.  
  
We’ll prioritize Docker images as the primary method for installing and upgrading server instances, with .zip distribution support ending in early 2025. As containerized deployments offering secure and isolated environments become the IT standard, we aim to align with industry best practices by focusing exclusively on containerized solutions. 

For **YouTrack Cloud**, we’re committed to providing a guaranteed cloud service uptime of 99.99% and confirming this in our terms of service.

We’re also expanding single sign-on (SSO) support to include automated user provisioning and deprovisioning. Okta and Entra ID integration improvements are coming in early in 2025, with additional updates to follow. To further enhance user management for enterprise teams, we’re introducing:

- SCIM 2.0 protocol support to further enhance user management capabilities.

- OIDC protocol support to make it possible to sign-in with even more identity providers.
