I was going to write about how much I've enjoyed "tinkering" with the HIBP API, but somehow, that term doesn't really seem appropriate any more for a service of this scale. On the contrary, we're putting in huge amounts of effort to get this thing fast, stable, and sustainable. We could do the first two very easily just by throwing money at the cloud, but that makes the last one a bit hard. Besides, both Stefán and I do enjoy the challenge of optimising an increasingly large system to run on a shoestring and even though the days of "a coffee a day of running costs" are well behind us, arguably the cost per request (or some other usage-based metric) is better than ever. I hope you enjoy this chat between the two of us and as I say in the video, do please chime in with your thoughts and suggestions.
