![The Challenges of Certifying the EUDI Wallet: A Deep Dive](https://www.cryptomathic.com/hubfs/feat.%20img.%20%281%29-1.png)

As the European Union solidifies the framework for the EUDI (European Digital Identity) wallet, the certification process outlined in the Implementing Acts has made significant progress. By establishing the certification requirements for the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (WSCD) and the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application (WSCA), the act lays down important steps toward ensuring the security of this critical digital identity solution. However, challenges remain—particularly in how these certifications interact and how the evolving nature of mobile applications like the WSCA might create bottlenecks in achieving a truly secure and agile EUDI wallet. 

In this post, we explore both the achievements and the gaps in the Implementing Acts, emphasizing the need for an independent cryptographic layer and agile certification processes to handle the fast-paced development environment of the WSCA. We also provide recommendations for enhancing the certification framework to better serve the dynamic needs of the EUDI wallet.
