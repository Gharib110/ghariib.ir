**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-55954  
**Published :** Jan. 16, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 45 minutes ago  
**Description :** OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management endpoint \`/api/{org\_id}/users/{email\_id}\` allows an "Admin" role user to remove a "Root" user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the \`remove\_user\_from\_org\` function does not prevent an "Admin" user from removing a "Root" user. As a result, an attacker with an "Admin" role can remove critical "Root" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The \`DELETE /api/{org\_id}/users/{email\_id}\` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version \`0.14.1\` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.  
**Severity:** 8.7 | HIGH
