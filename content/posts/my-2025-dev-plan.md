title: "My 2025 Dev Plan"

For the first time in my life, I'm setting concrete goals for the year ahead. 2025 isn't just another year - it's going to be my year of intentional growth, both as a developer and as a person. I want to share my goals with you, and more importantly, document this journey of transformation.

### 1\. Prioritizing Physical Well-being

Working remotely has its perks, but spending entire days in my room isn't one of them. My commitment? Three 30-minute walks per week.

### 2\. Mastering Java

Last year, Java was just a plan that never materialized. Not this year. I'll commit to learning Java and its frameworks.

### 3\. Collaborative Growth Through Pair Programming

They say two heads are better than one, and I'm putting that to the test. I'm committing to regular pair programming sessions with fellow developers. Not only will this improve my coding skills, but it'll also enhance my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively.

### 4\. Building a Content Creation Habit

I'll write blogs about what I'm learning and doing every week or month. Writing is a good habit and can also be a source of income.

### 5\. Create a Portfolio Website and Post Blogs on it

I'll build a new portfolio website using Next.js and Spring Boot. Although I'm not sure if Spring Boot can be hosted for free (if you know any options, please let me know in the comments).

### 6\. Embracing the LeetCode Challenge

Let's be honest - I'm not a LeetCode expert (yet). But I'm committing to solving one problem every week. Some problems are genuinely fun, and I'm excited to see how my problem-solving skills evolve over time.

### 7\. Ambitious Project Goals

Inspired by **CodeCrafters**, I'm taking on two significant projects:

- Building an HTTPS server from scratch in Java
- Creating an interpreter using Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" as my guide

## Progress Tracking

I'll be using:

- Obsidian for blog post planning and goal tracking
- Monthly reflection posts to assess progress and adjust course

I just remembered a quote from **ThePrimeagen**, video titled Cracking the Code | Open Sauce 2024:

> "The race of big man think really big, the race of little man think about the process and how to be the most efficient. Dream big, accomplish big, you may fail but you accomplish much more than something small."

I'm dreaming big while focusing on the process. By December 2025, I hope to look back at this post with a sense of accomplishment. But even if I don't hit every target, I know I'll have grown more than if I'd never set these goals at all.
