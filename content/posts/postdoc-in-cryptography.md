Job Posting: **Postdoc in Cryptography**  
_Aalto University, Finland_

We are looking for postdocs interested in working with us (Chris Brzuska and Russell Lai) on topics including but not limited to:

- Lattice-based cryptography, with special focus on the design, application, and analysis of non-standard lattice assumptions
- Succinct/zero-knowledge/batch proof and argument systems, functional commitments
- Advanced (e.g. homomorphic, attribute-based, functional, laconic) encryption and (e.g. ring, group, threshold, blind) signature schemes
- Time cryptography (e.g. time-lock puzzle, verifiable delay function, proof of sequential work)
- Fine-grained cryptography (e.g. against bounded-space-time adversaries)
- Lower bounds and impossibility results
- Key exchange and secure messaging

Feel free to drop us an email for discussions about the topics.

For more details about the position, and for the instructions of how to apply, please refer to https://www.hiit.fi/hiit-postdoctoral-and-research-fellow-positions/.

**Closing date for applications:**
