Jargon can be defined as **specialized** terminology and language specific to a particular field or profession.

However, the fact that technical writers are tasked with ensuring that the information is accurate and understandable makes jargon a double-edged sword.

This means that when used correctly, it enhances clarity and precision, but when misused, it can confuse and alienate the audience.

As implied above, jargon is sometimes good and can have some benefits when used correctly. In the following sections, we will explore some of it.

### **Clarity and Precision**

Jargon allows technical writers to convey complex ideas and concepts concisely. It acts as shorthand readily understood by those familiar with the field, reducing the need for lengthy explanations.

### **Efficiency**

Jargon can significantly improve the efficiency of technical communication. Rather than lengthy descriptive phrases, technical writers can use specialized terminology to convey information quickly and accurately.

### **Professionalism**

The use of jargon in technical writing can convey professionalism and expertise. It signals to the audience that the writer is well-versed in the subject matter and understands the nuances of the field.

Next, let’s explore the disadvantages of jargon in technical writing.

Jargon is not all good because it can create serious issues when you don’t use it properly. Some of them are explained in the following sections.

### **Alienating Non-Experts**

The most significant pitfall of excessive jargon use is that it can alienate non-expert readers. If the audience does not understand the specialized terminology deeply, they may struggle to comprehend the content.

### **Miscommunication**

Jargon can be a source of miscommunication when used incorrectly or imprecisely. Different fields or subfields may use the same term with slightly different meanings.

### **Overcomplication**

Sometimes, technical writers rely too heavily on jargon, even when more straightforward language would suffice. This can overcomplicate the text and make it difficult for readers to follow. It's essential to strike a balance between precision and simplicity.

### **Inaccessibility**

Excessive jargon use can make technical documents inaccessible to a broader audience. This is a concern, primarily when the information is meant to be disseminated widely or involves critical public safety information. In such cases, clear and plain language should be prioritized.

Now that you understand the benefits and drawbacks of jargon in technical writing, you’re probably asking, how do I use it properly in my technical writing? Let’s explore how to do that next.

In the following sections, let’s explore how to find balance when using jargon in your technical content.

### **Know Your Audience**

The first step in using jargon effectively is understanding your audience.

Consider their level of expertise and familiarity with the subject matter. Tailor your use of jargon to match the audience's knowledge and needs.

### **Define Jargon When Necessary**

When introducing jargon in your writing, provide clear and concise definitions.

This helps bridge the gap for readers who may not be familiar with the terminology. You can include a glossary or footnotes for reference.

### **Use Jargon Consistently**

Use jargon consistently throughout the document. Use widely accepted terminology within the field, and avoid unnecessary variations or synonyms. This consistency promotes clarity and precision.

### **Consider the Context**

The context in which jargon is used matters. In some sections of a document, such as the introduction or executive summary, minimizing jargon may be necessary to make the content more accessible.

Reserve in-depth technical language for sections where it is essential.

### **Balance Jargon with Plain Language**

Strike a balance between using jargon and plain language. Opt for more straightforward, everyday language to explain complex ideas whenever possible.

### **Review and Edit Carefully**

Review your technical writing carefully, watching for excessive or unnecessary jargon.

Consider seeking feedback from colleagues or experts to ensure your terminology is accurate and appropriate.
