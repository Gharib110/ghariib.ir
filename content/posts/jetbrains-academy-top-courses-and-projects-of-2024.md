This International Day of Education, we’re celebrating that in 2024 over 340,000 new coders joined JetBrains Academy, making our community almost 1.5 million members strong. 

To mark this impressive milestone, we’re looking back at the most popular JetBrains Academy offerings of 2024 – including JetBrains IDE courses (designed exclusively for IDEs) and Hyperskill projects (available both in-browser and in-IDE).
