We are thrilled to announce the GitLab Duo with Amazon Q offering, previously shared at AWS 2024 re:Invent, is now available in Preview (Beta) for GitLab Self-Managed Ultimate users, at no additional cost.

- AI-powered feature development: Use the `/q dev` quick action to transform requirements into merge-ready code.
- Automated code reviews: Leverage `/q review` for instant, intelligent feedback on code quality and security.
