In a move to enhance user privacy, WhatsApp has rolled out a significant update allowing users to control who can view their profile photos. This feature, available on both iOS and Android devices, provides users with more granular control over their privacy settings.

Previously, WhatsApp users could choose from three options for profile photo visibility: “Everyone,” “My Contacts,” and “Nobody.” The latest update introduces a fourth option, “My Contacts Except,” enabling users to hide their profile pictures from specific individuals without blocking them.

This is particularly useful for maintaining professional boundaries or safeguarding personal images from acquaintances or strangers.

To access this feature, users can follow these steps:

1. Open WhatsApp and navigate to the Settings tab.

4. Tap on Privacy and select Profile Photo.

7. Choose My Contacts Except and select the contacts you want to exclude.

10. Confirm by tapping Done.

For those seeking maximum privacy, the “Nobody” option remains available, ensuring that no one can view their profile picture.

This update aligns with WhatsApp’s broader commitment to user security. Recently, the platform also introduced a feature preventing users from taking screenshots of profile photos.

This measure aims to deny unauthorized sharing and misuse of personal images, further reinforcing privacy protections.

The new settings reflect WhatsApp’s understanding of its diverse user base, which spans personal and professional contexts. By offering customizable privacy controls, the platform empowers users to manage their digital presence effectively.

As privacy concerns grow in the digital age, WhatsApp’s latest update is a welcome step toward safeguarding personal information. Users are encouraged to explore these features to tailor their privacy settings according to their needs.
