**Published :** Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46Â minutes ago  
**Description :** The WP Inventory Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'message' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Severity:** 6.1 | MEDIUM
