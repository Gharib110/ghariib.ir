If you're working with Laravel and want an easier, more streamlined way to define routes without manually writing them in `web.php`, then **Laravel Folio** is something you should definitely check out!

#### **What Is Laravel Folio?**

Laravel Folio is a powerful page based router designed to simplify routing in Laravel applications.  
With Laravel Folio, generating a route becomes as effortless as creating a Blade template within your application's `resources/views/pages` directory.

Simply put, Laravel Folio lets you define routes based on file structure. For example, if you have a file named `about.blade.php` in your views folder, it will automatically create a route `/about`â€”no need to touch the traditional routes file.

#### **Why Use Laravel Folio?**

Here are some of its key benefits:

- **Quick and Easy**: Save time by letting the file structure handle your routes.
- **Seamless Blade Integration**: Fully compatible with Blade templates, allowing you to build dynamic pages effortlessly.
- **Perfect for Small Projects**: Ideal for landing pages, prototypes, or simple apps where speed matters.

#### **Hands-On Example**

1. Install the package:

```
   composer require laravel/folio
```

1. Create a new view file like `home.blade.php` in your `resources/views` folder.
2. Thatâ€™s it! Laravel will automatically map this file to `/home`.

#### **Summary**

Laravel Folio is convenient, especially for projects where simplicity and speed are priorities. To make it easier for others to get started, I created a small repository with practical example and a detailed explanation.
