Tricentis, a global leader in continuous testing and quality engineering, today announced the expansion of its test management and analytics platform, TricentisqTest, with the launch of Tricentis qTest Copilot. The latest addition to its suite of generative AI-powered Tricentis Copilot solutions, qTest Copilot harnesses the power of generative AI to simplify and accelerate test case generation, allowing for greater test coverage and higher-quality software releases.  

qTest Copilot is a generative AI assistant that automatically drafts test cases and test steps based on source documents and user requirements, offering considerable time-saving benefits when compared to manual approaches. Embedded into the newest version of the qTest platform, qTest Copilot combines Tricentis’ scalable and unified test management technology, with new AI-augmented features to allow QA and developer teams to greatly accelerate software delivery. 

Users can quickly create test coverage of any application, as well as explore unidentified quality gaps by broadening the test scope to include tests for additional scenarios and unexpected events. With a single click, both test steps and expected results are generated in seconds, enabling users to deliver higher-quality releases more confidently and with fewer escaping defects. 

The addition of generative AI features into qTest also enables more common and consistent test case descriptions, which both new and existing teams can use to create standards for how test cases are written across their entire test coverage. 

Other features include:    

- Select and easily control which projects and users are enabled for qTest Copilot. 
- Approve drafted test cases after modifying, deleting, or creating new steps as needed. 
- Prompt qTest Copilot to summarize for more concise outputs or to elaborate with more details. 
- Regenerate test steps or the entire test case without losing the overall test scope.  

Further features will also follow in 2025, including increased functionality for test case discovery, whereby users can map requirements to existing test cases, as well as test case and requirement review, which aims to analyze and improve the quality of existing assets in the qTest environment. 

“Developer and QA teams today are looking to drive meaningful and measurable improvements to the test coverage of their applications, all while driving significant productivity gains,” comments Mav Turner, Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Tricentis. “Feedback from our beta program suggests that qTest Copilot is enabling users to create complex test cases far more quickly than ever before, while also identifying gaps in test coverage that might have otherwise been overlooked. By automating these critical testing steps, teams can focus their efforts on higher-value activities, ultimately accelerating delivery timelines and improving overall software quality.”

Recent Tricentis research found that DevOps practitioners ranked testing as the most valuable (60%) area of AI investment across the software delivery lifecycle, and almost one-third (32%) of respondents estimate AI-augmented DevOps tools will save teams over 40 hours per month—equivalent to an entire workweek. The addition of qTest Copilot to the Tricentis suite of generative AI-powered test automation assistants follows the launch of Tricentis Testim Copilot in April and Tricentis Tosca Copilot in June. Tricentis Copilot solutions utilize generative AI to help enterprises streamline the testing process for faster cycles, more efficient testing, and better business outcomes. 

qTest Copilot will be included with all new purchases of the latest version of qTest. Existing qTest customers can also begin leveraging the enhanced benefits of qTest Copilot by purchasing an upgrade from their previous version of qTest to the new Tricentis qTest Enterprise AI version.
