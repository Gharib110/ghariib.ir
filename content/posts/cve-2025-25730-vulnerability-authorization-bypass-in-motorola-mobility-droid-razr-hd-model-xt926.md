![CVE-2025-25730 Vulnerability](https://socprime.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-2025-25730-400x234.jpg)

Hot on the heels of the disclosure of CVE-2025-1001, a novel Medixant RadiAnt DICOM Viewer vulnerability, another security issue emerges in the cyber threat landscape. A newly identified flaw, CVE-2025-25730, affects the Mobility Droid Razr HD (Model XT926) and enables nearby unauthorized attackers to access USB debugging, potentially compromising the host device.

With cyber threats evolving at an alarming pace, GitHub reports that by late 2024, an average of 115 CVEs were disclosed daily, while 14% of breaches stemmed from vulnerability exploitation—nearly three times higher than in 2023, according to Verizon.

## CVE-2025-25730 Analysis

According to the CERT-EU Threat Landscape Report 2024, exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing software remained a leading initial access vector for adversaries in the previous year, making vulnerability exploitation a continuous trend in 2025. 

A novel security issue in the Motorola Mobility Droid Razr HD (Model XT926) System Version 9.18.94.XT926.Verizon.en.US tracked as CVE-2025-25730 has recently come to the scene. Although the flaw still needs the NVD assessment, it can be considered critical, potentially enabling hackers to gain control over the host device if successfully weaponized. Motorola devices are vulnerable to improper access controls, allowing adversaries to bypass disabled Developer Options and USB Debugging authorization by executing specific steps before boot. This vulnerability enables tools like “adb” to access the device, even when a lock screen is set.

CVE-2025-25730 impacts Motorola Droid Razr HD (XT926), including the following system versions: Android Version 4.1.2, Build Number 9.8.1Q-94 and Baseband Version VANQUISH\_BP\_100730.151.64.17P or earlier.
