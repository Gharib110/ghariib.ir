Hello everyone!

We’re starting this year off with the opening of the RubyMine 2025.1 Early Access Program. In this blog post, you’ll find details about the new features and improvements we’ve been working on.

## What’s coming in RubyMine 2025.1?

### AI Assistant

The 2024.3 release introduced enhanced cloud-based completion for Ruby code. The upcoming release will expand that support to related technologies like RBS and ERB, offering faster, more context-sensitive completion and enhanced quality, as well as support for multiline completion.

We’re also implementing inline AI prompt functionality for those same technologies. This means you’ll be able to submit natural language requests to AI Assistant and get instant code changes in your RBS and ERB files.

### Debugger

We’re working hard to improve our debugging tools and fix existing problems. In version 2025.1, you’ll find fixes for multi-module projects, an improved experience when attaching to running processes, and a more straightforward installation and downloading of RubyMine debugger gems. With these changes we aim to provide a smoother and more reliable debugging experience overall, along with various bug fixes and performance optimizations.

### Remote development experience

Building on our previous release, we’re continuing to enhance remote development in RubyMine. We’re now working to introduce more responsive typing and editing for Ruby code when you’re working remotely with JetBrains Gateway, and we’re extending these improvements to RBS and ERB. Our goal is to reduce delays, resulting in a faster and more fluid coding experience.

### Support for Ruby 3.4

In RubyMine 2025.1, we’re introducing more changes and improvements to accommodate Ruby 3.4 features. Stay tuned for updates about better code insight and improved inspections.

Minor releases for RubyMine 2024.3 will include select Ruby 3.4 updates as well.

### Qodana for Ruby

We’re integrating Ruby inspections into Qodana, a smart code quality platform by JetBrains. Qodana offers customizable inspection profiles and detailed reports highlighting issues with solutions, and it facilitates code review optimization, standard enforcement, and team collaboration via cloud storage.

With the Qodana plugin in RubyMine, you will be able to run Qodana locally and then forward inspection reports to Qodana Cloud for storage and analysis.
