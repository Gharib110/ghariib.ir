ePrint Report: **A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security**  
_Anandarup Roy, Bimal Kumar Roy, Kouichi Sakurai, Suprita Talnikar_

This article explores the potential of Secret Sharing-Based Internet of Things (SBIoT) as a promising cryptographic element across diverse applications, including secure data storage in commercial cloud systems (Datachest), smart home environments (encompassing sensors, cameras, smart locks, and smart assistants), and e-health applications (protecting patient data and medical records). Beyond these applications, the paper makes two key contributions: the introduction of a novel cheater identification algorithm designed to verify the correct submission of shares during secret reconstruction, and empirical validation through experimental studies to support the theoretical advancements. This multifaceted approach not only demonstrates the versatility of SBIoT but also proposes innovative mechanisms to enhance security and integrity, contributing to the development of a more robust cryptographic framework. This article expands upon the work presented in the poster "A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security" at IWSEC 2023, Yokohama, Japan.
