At Tuta, we are deeply concerned about the proposed amendment to the so-called "Narcotrafic" law, which would force encrypted communication providers to implement backdoors for law enforcement. This would threaten everybodyâ€™s security and privacy and could be in conflict with European data protection legislation and Germany's IT Security Act. We urge the French National Assembly to reject this dangerous amendment. A backdoor for the good guys only is not possible.
