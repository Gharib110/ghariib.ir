ePrint Report: **How to use your brain for cryptography without trustworthy machines**  
_Wakaha Ogata, Toi Tomita, Kenta Takahashi, Masakatsu Nishigaki_

In this work, we study cryptosystems that can be executed securely without fully trusting all machines, but only trusting the user's brain. This paper focuses on signature scheme. We first introduce a new concept called \`\`server-aided in-brain signature,'' which is a cryptographic protocol between a human brain and multiple servers to sign a message securely even if the user's device and servers are not completely trusted. Second, we propose a concrete scheme that is secure against mobile hackers in servers and malware infecting user's devices.
