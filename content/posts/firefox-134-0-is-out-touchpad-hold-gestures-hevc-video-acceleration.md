A new monthly release of Mozilla Firefox web browser, version 134.0, is out today! Though, it’s not yet officially announced at the moment of writing.

According to the Mozilla Github releases page, the new Firefox release **added support for touchpad hold gestures for Linux**.

Meaning kinetic scrolling (aka momentum scrolling or inertia scrolling), the continuous scrolling after lifted fingers from touchpad, can be interrupted by placing two fingers on the touchpad.

For Windows users, the new Firefox release added **hardware acceleration support for HEVC video playback**. Meaning it can now offload the rendering process of videos encoded with H.265 or MPEG-H Part 2 codec from CPU to GPU, leading to smoother playback, reduced CPU usage and lower power consumption.

For Ecosia users, this search engine availability has been expanded to all languages in the German region along with Austria, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

And for users in US and Canada, the new tab layout has been refreshed with repositioned logo and weather widget, making better use of space.

Other changes include:

- Follow the model HTML specification for transient user activation more closely. This change makes popup blocking less strict in cases where previous versions of Firefox were overly aggressive, reducing erroneous blocking prompts.
- Improve support for debugging web extensions, such as automatically reloading the web extension’s source code in the Debugger when the extension is reloaded.
- Debugger log-point values are now automatically converted into profiler markers, making it easy to add information to the marker timeline directly from the Debugger.
- The Network panel displays information about Early Hints, including a dedicated indicator for the 103 HTTP status code in the user interface.
- And various security fixes.
