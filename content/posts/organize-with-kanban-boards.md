If you need to organize your projects, try using Kanban boards.

A Kanban board helps visualize all the tasks in your projects. It helps you see everything clearly, prioritize tasks, and track progress. Each task is represented by a card that moves along a path, usually labeled “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” This way, you can quickly see what’s happening, who’s doing what, and how the project is progressing.
