This September 23-25, at the 2025 Enterprise Tech Leadership Summit (ETLS) in Las Vegas, we will once again be exploring the impact of GenAI in our organizations. If you’re like me, you’ve experienced firsthand how generative GenAI reshapes our relationship with technology and how much we can benefit from it. Over the past year, I’ve been using it intensely in my daily work, and I’ve come to conclude that its impact will dwarf even the DevOps revolution that transformed our industry over the past decade.

Recently, every conversation I have had with technology leaders conveys the same mixture of excitement and awe, along with a sense of certainty that GenAI will impact their organizations. But we are all also struggling to find good answers to the questions often posed by our bosses:

- What are the best ways to use this new technology? 

- How do we best benefit from it? 

- How does this change how we organize?

- What skills do we need?

- How do we separate real opportunities from hype?

Last year at ETLS, attendees loved the “Ultimate GenAI Learning Day for Leaders.” This year, we will expand our GenAI programming to match the pace of breakneck innovation and disruption we are seeing in the industry. We’ll showcase even more organizations that are achieving amazing outcomes through the use of coding assistants, autonomous agents, and platform teams…and in a field that is moving so quickly, I’m certain we’ll learn of even more emerging innovations that will surprise, shock, and delight us all.

The Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit (September 23-25, 2025) has always been the conference where you come to learn from experts and fellow technology leaders. For years, your fellow travelers have shared how they’ve overcome and approached the challenges they face, including what worked and what didn’t. By doing so, attendees have learned how to address similar challenges within their own organizations—a skill that’s more important than ever during this period of frenzied innovation and GenAI adoption.

This spirit of shared learning directly supports our mission to help technology leaders succeed and their organizations win. I hope you can join us this September for what will be one of the most amazing years of learning—see you there!
