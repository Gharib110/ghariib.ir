It’s the final day of our first ever Pwn2Own Ireland. After three days of exploitation, we have awarded $993,625, so it seem likely we will pass the $1,000,000 mark. Still, there are no guarantees in Pwn2Own, so stay tuned for all the results.

* * *

_And we are done! Over the four days of the contest, we awarded $1,066,625 for over 70 0-day vulnerabilities. That makes four contests in a row that exceeded the million-dollar mark. Congratulations to the Viettel Cyber Security team for winning Master of Pwn with 33 points and $205,000. Our next event will be January 22-24, 2025 in Tokyo as we return for the second Pwn2Own Automotive. We hope to see you there._

**COLLISION** - A bug collision sends us over one million dollars for the contest. Team Smoking Barrels used two bugs to exploit the True NAS X, but they had been seen before in the contest. It still counts, as they earn $20,000 & 2 Master of Pwn points.

**SUCCESS**/**COLLISION** - Chris Anastasio (@mufinnnnnnn) and Fabius Watson (@FabiusArtrel) of Team Cluck used 6 bugs to go from the QNAP QHora-322 to the Lexmark CX331adwe, but 1 had already been seen in the contest. They still earn $23,000 and 9.25 Master of Pwn points.

**SUCCESS** - Our final attempt of Pwn2Own Ireland is confirmed! PHP Hooligans / Midnight Blue (@midnightbluelab) used an integer overflow to exploit the Lexmark printer and play us a tune. They earn $10,000 and 2 Master of Pwn points.
