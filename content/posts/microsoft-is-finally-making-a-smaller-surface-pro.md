Microsoft has been working on a smaller Surface Pro for a while, and it seems to finally be happening in the coming weeks.

Microsoft is reportedly preparing to launch smaller versions of the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop in the near future, and they could be launching sooner than you think. The company had already been reported to be working on a smaller Surface Pro last year, but plans for that seemingly fell through, as the Surface Pro 11 launched in the same 13-inch size as always.
