This was a much longer than usual update, largely due to the amount of time spent discussing the Earth 2 incident. As I said in the video (many times!), the amount of attention this has garnered from both Earth 2 users and the company itself is incommensurate with the impact of the incident itself. It's a nothing-burger. Email addresses and usernames, that's it, and of course, their association with the service, which may lead to some very targeted spam or phishing attempts. It's still a breach by any reasonable definition of the term, but it should have been succinctly summarised and disclosed to impacted parties with everyone moving on with more important things in life a few moments later. And that's exactly what I'm going to do right now ðŸ˜Š
