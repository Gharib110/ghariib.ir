Today, we're happy to welcome the 37th government to have full and free access to domain searches of their gov domains in Have I Been Pwned, Armenia. Armenia's National Computer Incident Response Team AM-CERT now joins three dozen other national counterparts in gaining visibility into how data breaches impact their national interests.

As we expand the reach of governments and organisations into HIBP, we hope to give defenders better insights into the impact of data breaches on their people so that the impact and value to attackers diminish.
