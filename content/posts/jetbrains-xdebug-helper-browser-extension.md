For years, PHP developers have relied on the popular Xdebug Helper Chrome extension to simplify their debugging experience with Xdebug. Unfortunately, this extension may soon no longer be supported, potentially disrupting developers’ workflows.

To ensure that PHP developers can continue debugging without interruptions, we’re collaborating with Fraser Chapman on the official Xdebug Helper extension for Chrome, with Firefox and Microsoft Edge releases planned for a later date. Originally developed by Fraser, the extension remains open source, with him continuing as the maintainer while JetBrains handles testing and releases. This new extension provides the same simple toggle to start Xdebug sessions with just a click.
