Multiple versions of our on-premises product will reach the end of support on October 14, 2025. Customers are encouraged to start planning and deploying upgrades now to ensure that installed products remain supported and secure, and to take advantage of new capabilities offered in successor products. The latest version of our on-premises product is Azure DevOps Server 2022.2.

October 14, 2025, is the date for the end of Extended Support for Team Foundation Server 2015 â€“ meaning it will no longer receive security updates or technical support. Upon end of support, there will be no new updates, free or paid assisted support options or online technical content updates. Upgrading from Team Foundation Server 2015 to Azure DevOps Server 2022.2 is fully supported and we strongly recommend that customers upgrade to the latest version before October 14, 2025, to continue getting security patches and support.

October 14, 2025, is also the date for the end of Mainstream Support for Azure DevOps Server 2020. We also support upgrading directly from Azure DevOps Server 2020 to Azure DevOps Server 2022 and we recommend upgrading before the end of Mainstream Support.

> **Note:** Release Management for Visual Studio 2015 is no longer supported since it was integrated in Team Foundation Server 2015 with Update 2. For more information on managing pipelines, see the What is Azure Pipelines documentation.
