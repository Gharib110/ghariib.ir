- **Microsoft Security Score as the New Benchmark** – A real-time metric that measures an organization’s adherence to security best practices within the Microsoft ecosystem.
- **Procurement & Supply Chain Impact** – Businesses will soon require minimum security scores for contracts, third-party risk assessments, and vendor selection.
- **Competitive Advantage & Business Growth** – Companies with high scores will use security as a differentiator, boosting marketability, M&A prospects, and investor confidence.

Trustwave has engaged with hundreds of enterprise customers across Australia and worldwide, and one overarching theme continues to emerge. Cybersecurity is no longer an IT problem; it is a core business concern.
