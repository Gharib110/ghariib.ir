### 1.WhatsApp Scam:

**Scam Tactics:**

Fraudsters on WhatsApp employ deceptive tactics to steal personal information, financial data, or gain unauthorized access to accounts. Common tactics include:

- **Phishing Links**: Messages with fake links mimicking trusted organizations, urging users to verify their accounts or claim rewards.  
    **_Example_****:** “Your account will be deactivated! Click here to verify your number now.”

**Case 1:** In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +244 country code, assigned to Angola. The message offers an unrealistic investment opportunity promising a high return in just four days, which is a common scam tactic. It uses pressure and informal language, along with a link for immediate action.

    **_Example_****:** “Earn ₹10,000 daily! Contact us to start now!”

**Case 3:** In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +91 country code, assigned to India. Scammers may contact you, posing as representatives of a legitimate company, offering a job opportunity. The recruiter offers an unrealistic daily income (INR 2000–8000) for vague tasks like searching keywords, which is suspicious. Despite requests, they fail to provide official company details or an email ID, raising credibility concerns. They also ask for personal information prematurely, a common red flag.

**Case 4:** In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +84 country code, assigned to Vietnam. The offer to earn money by watching a video for just a few seconds and providing a screenshot is a common tactic used by scammers to exploit individuals.
