Another discounted room block for DEF CON 33 has dropped! This time it’s at the ultra-swanky Fontainebleau, just a short walk from the LVCC.

To book yourself into the Fontainebleau, you can call (833) 702-7272 between 6am to 10pm (PST) or use this link: https://book.passkey.com/go/DefCon2025FBLV. You can also reach the link from defcon.org.

Maybe it’s time to treat yourself. 2025 will be here before you know it.
