## Deploying Llama 2 AI Locally

To effectively utilize Llama 2 AI models, security engineers can deploy them locally using tools like **LM Studio** and **Ollama**.

### LM Studio

This platform allows users to discover, download, and run local large language models (LLMs) on their computers. It supports architectures such as Llama 2, Mistral 7B, and others. LM Studio operates entirely offline, ensuring data privacy, and offers an in-app chat interface along with an OpenAI-compatible local server. Users can download compatible model files from Hugging Face repositories and explore new models through the app’s Discover page. Minimum requirements include an M1/M2 Mac or a Windows/Linux PC with a processor supporting AVX2.

### Ollama

Ollama enables users to run models like Llama 2 and Mistral 7B locally. It offers customization options and the ability to create personalized models. Ollama is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.

By deploying Llama 2 AI models locally, security engineers can maintain control over their data and tailor AI functionalities to meet specific organizational needs.
