**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-12313  
**Published :** Jan. 7, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 11 minutes ago  
**Description :** The Compare Products for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'woo\_compare\_list' cookie. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.  
**Severity:** 8.1 | HIGH
