# Srsly Risky Biz DeepSeek a boon for Chinese APTs

<br/>

<br/>
_UPDATED AUDIO: An earlier version of this podcast audio contained an editing mistake that desynchronised Patrick and Tom’s audio._

In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about the cyber espionage implications of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek’s recently released models. They will certainly be picked up by various APT crews to try and accelerate their campaigns.

They also discuss the UK NCSC’s attempt to quantify ‘comedy bugs’ and whether EU sanctions against Russian military intelligence officers for a five-year-old cyber espionage campaign targeting Estonia are pointless.

This episode is also available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/qltnlvvlCTE).
