`.env` files are widely used to configure applications by storing configuration settings, environment variables, and sensitive information. This eliminates the need to hardcode these values into the application code.

Previously, developers using PhpStorm had to manually install the .env Files Support plugin, originally created by Adel Faizrakhmanov, to unlock dedicated features for working with these files.

Wanting to ensure that PhpStorm users have everything they need for web development already built into the IDE, we reached out to Adel about transferring ownership of his .env Files Support plugin to JetBrains for bundling – and he graciously supported this idea. Starting with PhpStorm 2024.3.2, this plugin is included out of the box, with JetBrains taking over its development while keeping it open source.
