###### _This week in cybersecurity from the editors at Cybercrime Magazine_

The Cybercrime Magazine YouTube channel exceeded 500,000 subscribers today, up from the 100,000 we reported in our blog around 6 months ago when we earned a YouTube Silver Creator Award.

According to various sources, less than half of one percent of ALL YouTube channels have 100,000 subscribers. Our exclusive focus on cybercrime and cybersecurity makes us one of the top YouTube channels in our industry.

Launched by Cybersecurity Ventures in Feb. 2018, the Cybercrime Magazine YouTube channel features videos with tens of thousands of views, hundreds of thousands of views, and a million or more views.

We have produced more than 500 videos ranging from 1-2 minute market overviews and reports to full-length 15-30 minute interviews and panels, to 30-60 minute documentaries.

“Our new goal is (YouTube) Gold – to reach 1 million subscribers,” says Steve Morgan, founder of Cybersecurity Ventures and Editor-in-Chief at Cybercrime Magazine.
