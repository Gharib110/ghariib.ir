Hi everyone, I am Cheuk, your AI Assistant assistant! Jokes aside, I am the new AI Developer Advocate here at JetBrains.

Hi everyone, I am Cheuk, your AI Assistant assistant! Jokes aside, I am the new AI Developer Advocate here at JetBrains. My background is in data science and Python, although I have also recently started learning Rust. I am based in London, UK, and I am very excited to join the team.

My home community is the Python community, and I am also on the board of directors of the Python Software Foundation. Diversity and inclusion are close to my heart, and I would love to empower the community’s underrepresented members and give them the voice that they deserve.

As a developer advocate, it is my goal to help you unleash the full power of our IDEs and AI products. I work closely with the development teams, and I’ll be sharing my thoughts and ideas with you on various channels such as JetBrainsTV and the JetBrains Guide. I also have some exciting projects in the pipeline, so stay tuned for those this year! I want to help keep all our IDEs and AI products on the cutting edge – so if you have any feedback, I’m all ears! Finally, the conferences that I will be attending during the first half of this year are:  
  
– Rust Nation UK (February, London, UK)

– PyCon APAC (March, Manila, Philippines)

– Arc of AI (April, Austin, TX, USA)

– PyCon DE (April, Darmstadt, Germany)

– PyCon US (May, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)

– Perspektywy Women in Tech Summit (June, Warsaw, Poland)

– PyData London (June, London, UK)

– EuroPython (July, Prague, Czech Republic)

![Cheuk wearing kimono, come say hi to me when you spot me at conferences](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdrFfKk7deneybogYLK7zEJ5oN7mTArPMezGFfcF3Aa5i7tBEuQWPU7njnlfkX-kCp5gORoqrbOaJ1ctsq_BEGIp1vAMIzq954StRH6k-hTrqGEWw_aje8OssXgoeVLwhJ2t5eT7Q?key=i1H1l3SOONaP5uGsXfkMsL7k)

If you happen to spot me at a conference, don’t hesitate to say hello. I speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and (a little bit of) Japanese. I’m easy to recognize – most of the time, I wear a kimono at conferences. I’m also a nerd, so I would love to hear about the geeky hobby project that you have been working on. Get in touch with me by visiting my website.
