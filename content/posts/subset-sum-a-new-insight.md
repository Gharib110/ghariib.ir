ePrint Report: **Subset sum, a new insight**  
_Samir Bouftass_

In this paper, we show that subset sum problem consists on finding a solution over $mathbb{N}\_2$ of equation $n = textbf{A}X bullet U$ where A and n are given matrix and integer and U = $\[(2^0) (2^1) .... (2^{d-2}) (2^{d-1})\]$. We show that it can be subdivized into 2 solvable subproblems.
