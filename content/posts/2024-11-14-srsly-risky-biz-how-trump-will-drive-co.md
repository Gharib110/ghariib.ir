# Srsly Risky Biz How Trump will drive covert operations

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about what to expect from President Trump’s second term. Trump is an activist president who believes in using state power, so intelligence agencies will be pushed to conduct more audacious or even outrageous covert operations.

They also discuss concerns about a new UN cybercrime treaty that is set for a vote at the General Assembly and the Canadian government’s curious decision to force the closure of TikTok’s local offices.
