The notorious WantToCry ransomware group leverages misconfigured Server Message Block (SMB) services to infiltrate networks and launch widespread attacks.

The weaknesses in SMBs, such as weak credentials, outdated software, and poor security configurations, are providing attackers with an easy entry point through which attackers exploit publicly exposed network drives and NAS (Network-Attached Storage) devices.

Once inside, cybercriminals can move laterally across networks, escalate privileges, and deploy malicious payloads that encrypt critical files, crippling organizations.

Threat actors exploit exposed SMB services often due to weak authentication, outdated software, or default configurations to gain unauthorized access, execute lateral movement, and deploy ransomware payloads.

Once inside, attackers leverage vulnerabilities like EternalBlue to propagate across networks, encrypting critical data and disrupting operations. Properly securing SMB services is essential to mitigating these evolving threats.

The WantToCry ransomware group, active since December 2023, has recently escalated its operations, exploiting exposed SMB services to infiltrate networks, encrypt critical files, and demand hefty ransoms. Their attacks are a grim reminder of how simple misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic consequences.

### **How WantToCry Exploits SMB Vulnerabilities**

The WantToCry ransomware group employs a well-orchestrated attack strategy, leveraging brute-force techniques to compromise systems with weak or default credentials.

The group uses a massive database of over one million passwords to target exposed SMB services, along with other network protocols like SSH, FTP, RPC, and VNC.

Once inside a network, the attackers map and configure shared drives, encrypting files directly over the network without leaving traces on local systems. This approach not only maximizes the damage but also complicates detection and forensic analysis.

Victims are left with encrypted files bearing the “.want\_to\_cry” extension and a ransom note titled “!want\_to\_cry.txt.” The note provides instructions for payment and contact details, often directing victims to encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram or Tox.

According to the seqrite report, An attack typically begins with reconnaissance, where attackers scan the internet for systems with exposed SMB ports, usually on TCP port 445. Once identified, they launch a brute-force attack, attempting to gain unauthorized access using a vast dictionary of passwords.

After successfully infiltrating a system, they move laterally across the network, enumerating shared resources to locate critical data.

Finally, the attackers execute their payload by encrypting files on shared drives remotely, leaving no local footprint behind.

The consequences of misconfiguring SMB services and leaving them exposed to the internet without proper authentication can be severe. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to access and exfiltrate sensitive data, leading to potential breaches.

Ransomware attacks may follow, encrypting critical files and making them inaccessible without payment.

The recovery efforts can cause significant operational disruptions, leading to downtime, reduced productivity, and financial losses. A high-profile attack can also damage an organization’s reputation, eroding customer trust and confidence.

## **Protecting Against SMB Exploits**

To mitigate the risks posed by exposed SMB services, cybersecurity experts recommend the following measures:

1. **Disable Unnecessary SMB Services:** If SMB is not actively used, turn it off to reduce the attack surface.

4. **Enforce Strong Authentication:** Require complex passwords and multi-factor authentication for SMB access.

7. **Restrict Public Access:** Use firewalls to block external access to SMB ports (445 and 139).

10. **Regular Updates and Patching:** Ensure all systems are running the latest software versions to address known vulnerabilities.

13. **Network Segmentation:** Isolate critical systems to limit the spread of ransomware in case of a breach.

16. **Advanced Monitoring:** Deploy behavior-based detection tools to identify and respond to suspicious activities.

The WantToCry ransomware group’s exploitation of SMB vulnerabilities highlights the critical need for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity hygiene. Simple misconfigurations can have far-reaching consequences, enabling attackers to bypass defenses and inflict significant damage.

As ransomware attacks grow in sophistication, securing SMB services is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. By adopting proactive security measures and fostering a culture of vigilance, organizations can protect their data, operations, and reputation from the ever-present threat of ransomware.

### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**

Organizations should be vigilant for the following IOCs associated with WantToCry:

- **IP Addresses:** 194\[.\]36\[.\]179\[.\]18, 194\[.\]36\[.\]178\[.\]133

- **Detection Signature:** HEUR:Trojan.Win32.EncrSD (for shared drive encryption activity).
