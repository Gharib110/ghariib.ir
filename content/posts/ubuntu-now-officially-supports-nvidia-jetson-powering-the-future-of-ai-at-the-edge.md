Canonical, the publisher of Ubuntu, announced official support for the NVIDIA Jetson platform, marking a significant milestone in its collaboration with NVIDIA to accelerate AI innovation at the edge. This General Availability (GA) release brings enterprise-grade stability and support to the powerful combination of Ubuntu and NVIDIA Jetson system-on-modules. 

## Empowering AI innovation across industries

The official support of Ubuntu for NVIDIA Jetson modules through Canonical’s certified hardware program enables developers and enterprises to create breakthrough AI solutions across all industries. From autonomous machines and smart cities to industrial automation and robotics, this collaboration opens up new possibilities for AI-driven innovation to benefit from a stable and improved OS and cutting-edge hardware.

Key benefits of this collaboration include:

- Unparalleled performance: Harness the full potential of the NVIDIA Jetson platform’s powerful AI capabilities with optimized Ubuntu images.
- Enterprise-ready security: Benefit from Ubuntu’s robust security features and long-term support.
- Seamless development to deployment: Experience a unified environment from cloud to edge, streamlining the AI development process.
- Reliable stability on certified hardware: Canonical’s QA team performs an extensive set of over 500 OS compatibility-focused hardware tests to ensure that every aspect of the system is checked and verified for the best Ubuntu experience. 

## Introducing Ubuntu Core for NVIDIA Jetson

Ubuntu Core is a minimal, secure, and strictly confined operating system designed specifically for deploying production images for IoT and edge computing devices.

This ‘immutable’ flavor of Ubuntu puts every system component, and the system itself, into a set of containers with strict kernel-enforced confinement. It supports reliable over-the-air updates with failsafe rollbacks, making it ideal for intelligent edge and IoT applications. Once you have created your application in Ubuntu Desktop or Server, you can now build your immutable Ubuntu Core image based on your developed applications for your NVIDIA Jetson.

Ubuntu Core on NVIDIA Jetson offers:

- Production images: Streamline your production with the ability to create custom images for your NVIDIA Jetson applications. 
- Enhanced security: Built from the ground up with security in mind, ensuring cybersecurity-compliant and trustworthy devices in critical environments.
- Efficient device management: Enjoy reliable, remotely accessible devices with mission-critical over-the-air (OTA) and seamless updates.
- Agile containerization: Benefit from an immutable and strictly confined system that separates the kernel, OS image, and your applications.
- Hardware ecosystem support: Tested and optimized for leading IoT and edge devices, including NVIDIA Jetson.
