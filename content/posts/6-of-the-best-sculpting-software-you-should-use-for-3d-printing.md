These are the best sculpting software you should be using with your 3D printer.

If you want to create highly detailed or organic 3D models, 3D sculpting is the best technique. Unlike other 3D design methods that rely on manipulating vertices, edges, and faces to shape the objects, sculpting allows for a more intuitive, brush-based approach, making it easier to achieve smooth, natural shapes and intricate details. This is why itâ€™s the most recommended method of creating characters, figurines, jewelry designs, and organic objects like trees and rocks. You can use sculpting brushes and tools to manipulate the design through pushing, pulling, pinching, moving, and smoothing until you achieve the intended design.
