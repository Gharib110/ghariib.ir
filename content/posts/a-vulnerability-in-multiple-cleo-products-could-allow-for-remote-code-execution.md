A vulnerability has been discovered in multiple Cleo products that could allow for remote code execution. Cleoâ€™s LexiCom, VLTransfer, and Harmony is software that is commonly used to manage file transfers. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
