With the rise of high-quality language models, each excelling in different tasks, developers need flexible options to meet diverse challenges. That’s why we’re focused on providing multi-model support, helping you create workflows that fit your needs.

### Anthropic’s Claude models now available in AI chat

Integrated directly into JetBrains IDEs, AI Assistant already leverages our proprietary Mellum LLM for contextual code completion and third-party models for tasks like chat, test generation, documentation suggestions, and commit message creation.

With this release, we’re adding support for the latest Claude models, including **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and **Claude 3.5 Haiku**. You can now choose Claude models in the chat, enabling AI Assistant to assist with coding tasks, such as explaining code, suggesting refactoring, and answering programming questions.

> “As someone who’s spent years building tools developers love, I’m excited about JetBrains integrating Claude into their AI Assistant. This partnership brings together JetBrains’ deep understanding of developer workflows with Claude’s advanced capabilities – exactly the kind of integration that helps developers do their best work. It’s great to see companies working together to give developers more powerful, flexible tools right in their IDE.”

**Mike Krieger** Chief Product Officer, Anthropic

### Why does JetBrains provision Claude models in Amazon Bedrock?

This integration leverages Amazon Bedrock’s infrastructure. Here’s why it’s a critical advantage for users:

- **Global availability**. Amazon Bedrock operates across 17 regions worldwide, with new regions being added rapidly. This global presence ensures consistent access to AI services while adhering to data residency requirements and complying with local regulations.

- **Reliable performance**. With cross-region inferencing, workloads are automatically distributed during high traffic, minimizing latency and ensuring smooth operation even under heavy demand.

### How to get started with Claude models in AI Assistant

Claude models are available starting with version 24.3.2 of JetBrains IDEs. If you’re already a user, update to the latest version to explore the new features.
