We’ve just released the first edition of the JetBrains Qodana Software Quality Report which looks at key findings from 2024. We decided to conduct this research to gain a deeper understanding of best practices for delivering quality software today, and how companies of different sizes and maturity levels determine when their product is production-ready.

To this end, we surveyed 808 software developers, QA engineers and other technical professionals to document real-world feedback from all corners of the software development community. This, resulted in unexpected findings all of which are unpacked in this comprehensive, 26-part report.

## A taste of what’s inside

The report showcases a shift in intensity with regards to code quality, as products evolve from launch to maturity, which we can see in a marked increase in using quality gates, testing priority and 

1. The use of _automated quality gates_ increased from 27% in the development stage to 40% after launch.

4. The larger the development team, the more priority was placed on automated tests. 

7. 52% of partipants said they faced technical challenges and 45% said organizational and process challenges, even if there was companywide consensus on implementing code quality measures.

The **argument for improving quality processes was clear** in terms of returns cited and offers a compelling narrative for how software development is evolving with **improved product reliability and performance** and so much more. 

Read the full report to get these and other details, as well as: 

- **Best and worst practices**: A snapshot of how software quality practices are managed, and the key factors influencing decision-making during software releases.

- **Perspectives specific to product maturity and company growth**: Insights into how the stage of a project and the company’s size shape its approach to code quality.

- **Quality investment trends**: Analysis of when and why companies choose to invest more in quality.

- **Challenges and solutions**: A look at the common hurdles in the release and quality assurance process, and some unconventional strategies for overcoming them.
