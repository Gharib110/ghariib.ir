Intel is the one to watch in the GPU scene.

It's such an odd time to be an Intel fan. The company continues to struggle with its desktop CPUs but Lunar Lake mobile processors and Arc discrete graphics cards have been largely well received. I'm a big fan of Intel's push into the affordable GPU market segment, offering gamers excellent value with Battlemage GPUs for less than $250. The latest addition to the family is the Intel Arc B570, a 1080p and 1440p GPU for $219, seriously undercutting some of the offerings from direct competitors. It's a great time to be a PC gamer as Intel looks to break up the GPU duopoly and here's why these cards will be a sleeper hit for desktop systems.
