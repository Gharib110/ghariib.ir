The warning message indicates that the globally installed Angular CLI version in your system is greater than the locally installed one in the project. The problem is that the older version is being used because Angular CLI looks for the local version first when executing commands on a project. This version mismatch may cause incompatibility issues and errors such as the one you’re experiencing.

This tutorial will help you to resolve “Your global Angular CLI version is greater than your local version” issue in your Angular application.

## 1\. Local Angular CLI Version Upgrade

To fix the mismatch, update the existing local Angular CLI package to ensure its version matches your global version or is greater and compatible with your project.

1. **Check the Angular version of your project**: Open the **package.json** file and check the versions for @angular/cli and @angular/core.
2. **Update the local Angular CLI**: Use npm install to update the CLI to a version compatible with your project. For example:
    
    ```
    npm install @angular/cli --save-dev
    ```
    
3. **Reinstall dependencies**: Delete the **node\_modules** folder and **package-lock.json**, then reinstall:
    
    ```
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    ```
    

## 2\. Use the Global Angular CLI

If you want to use the global CLI only for a single execution and override the version mismatch, you can explicitly call the global one with npx:

```
npx @angular/cli serve
```

This uses the global version only for the current command and does not change the local version.

## 3\. Global Angular CLI Downgrade

If consistency is your priority and you prefer to rely on the older version that is already installed locally in your project for development work, you can uninstall the new global installation and reinstall the previous one:

1. Uninstall the global Angular CLI:
    
    ```
    npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
    ```
    
2. Set up a compatible global version:
    
    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
    

## 4\. Optional Step: Create a New Project

If the version mismatch creates extreme incompatibility, it might be best to create a new Angular project using the global version of the CLI and move your code:

1. Create a new project:
    
    ```
    ng new my-new-project
    ```
    
2. Copy your old files and adjust configuration files like **angular.json** and **package.json**.
