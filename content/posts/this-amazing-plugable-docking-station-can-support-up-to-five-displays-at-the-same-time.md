A must-have for the monitor aficionado.

Personally, I find it hard to use a PC unless it has two monitors. It's just nice to have something on the side while I'm working away on the main monitor. Some people have a need for five monitors, and I can't even wrap my head around how I'd even begin to use that number of screens, but I respect (and fear) the people who do. If you're one who enjoys multiple monitors, you'll like this new Plugable dock announced at CES 2025 that can handle your love for a huge array of screens.
