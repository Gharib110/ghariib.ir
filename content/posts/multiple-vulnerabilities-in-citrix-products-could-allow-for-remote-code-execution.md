Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Citrix products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Citrix ADC performs application-specific traffic analysis to intelligently distribute, optimize, and secure Layer 4 - Layer 7 network traffic for web applications. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
