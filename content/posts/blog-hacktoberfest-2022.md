We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year! Hacktoberfest is a month-long global celebration of open source software.

All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate in Hacktoberfest and join a global community of open source contributors.

**Learn more about Hacktoberfest and sign up here.**

### Contribute to Jenkins X

We welcome your contributions to the Jenkins X project!

Issues labelled “hacktoberfest” generally indicate good first issues. However, all pull requests will count towards your Hacktoberfest challenge.

Refer to the contribution guides for making code and documentation changes.

Refer to this document to get an idea about the location of the different Jenkins X source code repositories. Normally the labels assigned to the ticket will help you in deciding which part of the Jenkins X codebase to look at. The maintainers will also try to link the relevant repository for hacktoberfest issues in the issue comment.

Once you are done with the contribution, request a review from the maintainers by adding the comment in your pull request.

```bash
/cc @ankitm123 @babadofar @msvticket @osamamagdy @rajatgupta24 @tomhobson
```
