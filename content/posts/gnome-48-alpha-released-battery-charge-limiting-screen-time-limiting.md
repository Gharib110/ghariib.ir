The first alpha release of GNOME 48 is out today! See what’s new in the desktop environment that will be default in next Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42.

First, GNOME 48 introduced **new core app called Decibels**. It’s a simple audio player that features playback speed adjustment, easy seek controls, and hows the waveform of the track.

To promote healthier habits and/or parental control, the new release introduced **initial screen time limits** support! It added initial **Wellbeing panel** in GNOME Control Center (aka Settings), allowing to view screen time usage on the device and set daily time limits. However, the feature is disabled by default!

For laptop/tablet devices, GNOME 48 finally introduced **battery charge limiting** option in _Power_ settings page. Somehow, it’s NOT available in my case when trying it out in an old laptop … And, the power settings page is redesigned into “General” and “Power Saving” tabs with clear design.

Loupe, the default image viewer, in the release now has the ability to edit JPEG and PNG files with `crop`, `rotate`, and `flip` options. And, it now displays XMP metadata for JPEG images.
