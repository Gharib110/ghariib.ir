## What is the GenAI Platform?

The GenAI Platform is an all-in-one solution that empowers you to build and scale AI agents quickly, no matter where you are in your AI journey. These agents leverage state-of-the-art Generative AI models from organizations like Anthropic, Meta, and Mistral AI, and come equipped with advanced features such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), function routing, agent customization, and guardrails to help you create more secure, context-aware applications.

Whether you’re a seasoned developer or new to AI, the GenAI Platform simplifies the process of creating intelligent tools for tasks like customer support, data insights, task automation, and more.

> _“By using DigitalOcean’s GenAI Platform, we’ve gained the leverage to take our AI development knowledge and apply it much faster. The platform has lowered the threshold for deploying complex AI models, making it easier to build and test proof-of-concept applications. The seamless integration of GPU-powered services and the ease of deploying models through DigitalOcean has allowed our teams to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.” - Johan Bengtsson, Digital Strategist & Co-Owner, Brainforest_
