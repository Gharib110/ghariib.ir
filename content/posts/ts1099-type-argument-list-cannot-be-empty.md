# TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding optional static types. This means that while you can write JavaScript in TypeScript, you also have the ability to define the types of variables, function parameters, and objects, leading to improved code quality and developer experience. Types in TypeScript allow you to specify what kind of data can be used, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.

## What Are Types?

Types in TypeScript refer to the classifications of values that help in catching bugs earlier in the development process. Types can be primitive (such as `number`, `string`, and `boolean`) or complex (such as arrays, objects, and custom types). By defining types, developers can make sure their functions and variables receive the expected kind of data, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

## Understanding TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty

The error TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty occurs in TypeScript when you attempt to use a generic type without supplying the required type arguments. Generics are a powerful feature in TypeScript that allows developers to create reusable components that can work with various data types while still maintaining type safety.

### Example of TS1099

Consider the following code snippet:  

```
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

// Incorrect usage leading to TS1099
const result = identity(); // TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty
```

In this example, the function `identity` is a generic function that expects a type argument `T`. When calling `identity()` without specifying any type, TypeScript throws the error TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty.

### How to Fix TS1099

To resolve this issue, you need to provide a type argument when calling the generic function:  

```
const result = identity<number>(42); // Correct usage
```

By specifying `number` as the type argument, the error TS1099 is resolved, and the function now understands what type of data it should expect.

### Another Example

Let's examine a more complex usage of generics that can lead to the same error:  

```
interface GenericContainer<T> {
    value: T;
}

// Incorrect usage leading to TS1099
const container: GenericContainer = { value: 123 }; // TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty
```

Here, `GenericContainer` is defined as a generic interface. When we try to create a `container` instance without specifying a type argument, we encounter TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty.

### Fixing the Interface Issue

To fix this, supply the type argument when declaring the variable:  

```
const container: GenericContainer<number> = { value: 123 }; // Correct usage
```

Providing `number` as the type argument resolves the TS1099 error, ensuring that `value` within `container` is correctly typed as a number.

## Important Things to Know About TS1099

1. **Generics Require Type Arguments**: Always remember to provide the necessary type arguments when using generic types or functions.
2. **Compiler Errors**: TypeScriptâ€™s compiler errors like TS1099 help you identify where types are expected, leading to better structured code.
3. **Type Inference**: Even though TypeScript can sometimes infer types, with generics you need to be explicit to avoid errors like TS1099.
4. **Maintainability**: Properly using type arguments can improve the maintainability of your code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand your intent and constraints.

### FAQ about TS1099

- **What does TS1099 mean?**
    
    - It means that you're trying to use a generic type without specifying which type to use.
    

- **How do I fix TS1099?**
    
    - Always provide the required type argument to your generic types or functions.
    

- **Why use generics in TypeScript?**
    
    - Generics allow you to create reusable, type-safe components which can work with multiple data types.
    

In summary, TS1099: Type argument list cannot be empty serves as a reminder to developers to use generics thoughtfully in TypeScript. Always specify the type argument so that TypeScript can help you catch potential issues early in your development workflow. Use this knowledge to enhance your coding experience and write more robust applications!
