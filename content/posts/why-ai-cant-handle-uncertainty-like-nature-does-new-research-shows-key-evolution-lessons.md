## Overview

- Research examines how machine learning systems handle fundamental uncertainty
- Compares biological evolution's robustness to AI systems' brittleness
- Introduces concept of "Knightian uncertainty" in AI systems
- Proposes new frameworks for developing more adaptable AI
- Highlights limitations of current machine learning approaches

## Plain English Explanation

Machine learning systems today are like students who can only answer questions they've seen before. When faced with completely new situations, they often fail spectacularly. This contrasts sharply with biological evolution, which has produced organisms that can handle novel cha...
