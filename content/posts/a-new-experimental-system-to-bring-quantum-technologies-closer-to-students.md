The world of quantum physics is experiencing a second revolution, which will drive an exponential leap in the progress of computing, the internet, telecommunications, cybersecurity and biomedicine.

Quantum technologies are attracting more and more students who want to learn about concepts from the subatomic world—such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition —to explore the innovative potential of quantum science.

In fact, understanding the non-intuitive nature of quantum technology concepts and recognizing their relevance to technological progress is one of the challenges of 2025, declared the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology by UNESCO.
