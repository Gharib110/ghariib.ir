**Common Features of Phishing:-**

- **Too good to be true**\-Many people claim you won an iPhone, a lottery, or some other lavish prize. Avoid clicking on suspicious emails. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

You may be told that your account will be suspended if you do not update your personal information immediately. The most reliable organizations always give patrons plenty of time before terminating an account, and they never ask them to update their personal information online. If in doubt, visit the source directly rather than clicking a link.
- **Hyperlinks****–** Clicking on a link shows you the actual URL to which you will be directed. It could be something completely different, or it could be a popular website with a misspelling, such as www.bankofarnerica.com – the ‘m’ is an ‘r’ and an ‘n’, so look carefully.
- **Attachments****–** Payloads like viruses and ransomware are often contained in attachments. Clicking on a .txt file is always safe.
- **Unusual Sender** – If anything seems out of character, unexpected, out of the ordinary, or just suspicious in general, don’t click on it!
