Buying a new gaming monitor feels pointless to me

When you hear the term PC upgrades, what do you imagine? â€” probably a GPU, CPU, SSD, RAM, or motherboard (in that order). At least, that's how I think about PC upgrades. Although I haven't made any major upgrades to my PC in almost 3 years, I never thought about upgrading my monitor in all that time. My existing monitor is an LG 27GL850, a 27" 1440p 144Hz IPS display that I purchased back in 2021.
