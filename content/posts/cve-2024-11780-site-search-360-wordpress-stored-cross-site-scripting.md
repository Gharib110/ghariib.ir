**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-11780  
**Published :** Feb. 1, 2025, 4:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 11 minutes ago  
**Description :** The Site Search 360 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'ss360-resultblock' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.  
**Severity:** 6.4 | MEDIUM
