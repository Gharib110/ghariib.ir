**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-22609  
**Published :** Jan. 24, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 3 minutes ago  
**Description :** Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to attach any existing private key on a coolify instance to his own server. If the server configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim's server configuration, then the attacker can use the \`Terminal\` feature and execute arbitrary commands on the victim's server. Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes the issue.  
**Severity:** 10.0 | CRITICAL
