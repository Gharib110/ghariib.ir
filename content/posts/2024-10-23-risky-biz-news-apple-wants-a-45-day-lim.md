# Risky Biz News Apple wants a 45 day limit on TLS certificates

<br/>

<br/>
_This episode previously referred to a 10 day limit, but we read the wrong bit of a table. This has been corrected in the title to 45 days, but the podcast audio still refers to the incorrect 10 day maximum age. Sorry!_

A short podcast updating listeners on the security news of the last few days, as prepared by Catalin Cimpanu and read by Claire Aird.
