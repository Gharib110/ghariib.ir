In mid-October, we released our 2024 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, which revealed over 600 million identity attacks per day. As multifactor authentication now blocks most password-based attacks, we’re seeing a shift in threat actor tactics and a convergence of nation-state and cybercriminal threat activity. More than 99% of identity attacks are password attacks—often due to predictable human behaviors like easy-to-guess passwords, password reuse, and falling prey to phishing attacks.1 That’s why comprehensive, integrated identity and access management (IAM) should be a core part of any organization’s threat-informed defense. Today we’re honored to announce that for the eighth year in a row, Microsoft has been named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management—placed highest on the Ability to Execute axis. 

## Delivering on identity and access management for customers

We believe our 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ recognition validates our commitment to delivering a comprehensive, AI-powered and automated identity portfolio to customers, with Microsoft Entra. It empowers customers to protect their digital everything with a simplified user experience that makes identity and access management (IAM) easier than ever before. And it’s informed by our customers and partners—to whom we thank and share this honor.

Secure access with Microsoft Entra

## Looking to the future

As we celebrate this year’s recognition, we’re also hard at work on new and expanded features—looking ahead to meet customers’ changing IAM needs as our collective threat landscape continues to evolve.

Microsoft Entra ID currently supports **device-bound passkeys** stored on FIDO2 security keys and in Microsoft Authenticator. And we’re investing in both synced and device-bound passkeys for work accounts. For enterprises that use passwords today, passkeys provide a seamless way for workers to authenticate without entering a username or password. Passkeys provide improved productivity for workers and have better security. Read more about requirements and instructions to enable passkeys for your organization.
