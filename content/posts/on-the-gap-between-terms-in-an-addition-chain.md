ePrint Report: **On the gap between terms in an addition chain**  
_Theophilus Agama_

In this paper, we study the distribution of the textit{gap} between terms in an addition chain. In particular, we show that if $1,2,ldots,s\_{delta(n)}=n$ is an addition chain of length $delta(n)$ leading to $n$, then $$underset{1leq lleq delta(n)}{mathrm{sup}}(s\_{l+k}-s\_l)gg kfrac{n}{delta(n)}$$ and $$underset{1leq lleq delta(n)}{mathrm{inf}}(s\_{l+k}-s\_l)ll kfrac{n}{delta(n)}$$ for fixed $kgeq 1$.
