For serious AI builders who need more control, more power, and less noise in your cloud infrastructure, it’s time to explore DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs with NVIDIA accelerated computing. These servers are purpose-built to tackle the most demanding AI/ML workloads, model training, and custom infrastructure setups. With 8 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs and powerful hardware, these servers offer high-performance compute capabilities and customization options designed for intense processing needs.

## Why DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs?

DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs with NVIDIA accelerated computing offer dedicated, single-tenant infrastructure with no neighbors, so you have full access to all your GPUs. These servers are tailored for projects that require direct control over hardware to achieve optimal performance and privacy, and are well-suited for use cases like large-scale model training, real-time inference, and complex orchestration. With dedicated hardware you get direct access to all resources, ideal for pushing the limits of what your applications can achieve.

> _“The most important thing for our company is to continue delivering a really exceptional user experience and continuing to make that even better. So that’s going to involve research and development for the models, which requires heavy duty GPU computing power that DigitalOcean provides.”_

## Benefits of choosing Bare Metal GPUs

1. **Model training at scale:** Tackle large datasets with ease. Bare Metal GPUs allow you to fully optimize model training, offering privacy, performance, and control over the entire process.
2. **Model fine-tuning**: Start with a pre-trained model and adapt it to your specific use cases by fine-tuning with specialized datasets. Bare Metal’s high-performance GPUs and isolated environment make it possible to get the accuracy and performance needed for specialized applications.
3. **High-speed inference:** With Hopper GPUs handling inference, your applications can achieve real-time performance for live predictions and decision-making—ideal for user-facing products that demand responsiveness.
4. **Custom use cases:** Bare Metal GPUs are ideal for custom workloads that demand high configurability and dependable, dedicated infrastructure. Whether deploying Kubernetes clusters or custom orchestration setups, these servers provide the flexibility needed to build and scale complex architectures.

## Bare Metal GPUs vs. GPU Droplets

Our Bare Metal GPUs and GPU Droplets are designed to suit different workloads. GPU Droplets provide easy scalability and quick provisioning, perfect for teams focused on training, fine-tuning, or running inference on LLMs. In contrast, Bare Metal GPUs deliver maximum performance and control, ideal for sustained, high-throughput workloads that demand direct access to hardware resources and customization.
