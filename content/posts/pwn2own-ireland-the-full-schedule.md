Welcome to Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 - our first event ever from the emerald isle! This year’s contest is set to be one of our largest ever - both in terms of entries and potential prizes. If everything hits, we will end up paying out over $1,000,000 in cash and prizes. We’ve got four days of exciting competition ahead. As always, we began our contest with a random drawing to determine the order of attempts. If you missed it, you can watch the replay here.

The complete schedule for the contest is below (all times Irish Standard Time \[UTC +1:00\]).

_Note: All times subject to change_
