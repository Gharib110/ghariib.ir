## Overview

- Combines low-rank adapters with neural architecture search to compress large language models
- Introduces elastic LoRA adapters that can dynamically adjust model size
- Achieves 2x faster search speeds compared to traditional methods
- Maintains 95% of original model performance while reducing parameters
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple language model architectures

## Plain English Explanation

Think of large language models like massive libraries - they contain lots of knowledge but take up huge amounts of space. This research introduces a clever way to shrink these models while keeping their capabilities, similar to creating a condensed version of a book that mainta...
