Get the thock you always wanted with these simple mods.

I absolutely love my mechanical keyboard. For the past few years, I've been using a Keychron K2 V2 with minor upgrades every now and then. Trust me when I say this -- once you switch to a mechanical keyboard -- there's no going back. There are a plethora of mechanical keyboards out there in the market that you can buy, or you could even build your own mechanical keyboard with custom parts. Regardless of which option you choose, the world of mechanical keyboards is a rabbit hole that keeps going deeper and deeper. What I mean to say is, that you can keep upgrading or modding your keyboard with time to make it even better.
