## HiFive Premier P550 Development System

SiFive announced the HiFive Premier P550 around mid 2024. Canonical,  SiFive and ESWIN Computing collaborated to ship it with Ubuntu pre-installed this month. 

The board’s SoC, the EIC7700X was designed by ESWIN Computing.   It features a quad-core SiFive P550 Core Complex, running at 1.4GHz, which is the highest performing commercially available RISC-V CPU in the world.

The board features include: 

- 16GB/32GB LPDDR5
- 1x PCIe expansion slots
- Dual 10/100/1000 Ethernet, SATA3
- 5 x USB 3 ports
- On-board GPU and a host of other features too long to list.

### The essence of RISC-V is collaboration and openness  

The joint development between ESWIN Computing, SiFive, and Canonical to bring Ubuntu 24.04 LTS to the HiFive Premier P550 embodies the core values of RISC-V: collaboration and openness.

“_We are very proud to bring this premium product to market, and would like to celebrate our partners, ESWIN Computing, for their hardware expertise and Canonical for their collaboration and work to bring the best Ubuntu experience to developers on this flagship RISC-V development platform_,” said SiFive’s Martyn Stroeve, Head of Corporate Marketing. “_This partnership represents an all-star team committed to offering developers an exceptional and premium out-of-box experience._”

“_We are excited to see what developers do with this board, and how they use all the performance and features that we have packed into it_”, said Bo Wang, Vice Chairman of ESWIN Computing. “_It’s an exciting time to be in the RISC-V ecosystem and ESWIN Computing is happy to be at the forefront of the next era of RISC-V performance and software development with HiFive Premier P550.  The partnership with SiFive and Canonical ensures the product delivers true industry leading performance and experience._”

“_Canonical is deeply committed to RISC-V and creating the best software environment possible for developers coming into this ecosystem. The HiFive Premier P550 is set to be the de facto development platform, and with Ubuntu coming pre-installed on the board we are excited to see the platform used by innovators and developers_,”  said Gordan Markus, Silicon Alliances Director, Canonical. 

By using Ubuntu, the developers using the HiFive Premier P550 can leverage the latest and greatest of open source technologies and tap into the full potential of this premium development platform. SiFive, ESWIN Computing and Canonical aim to build a thriving community of open source and RISC-V enthusiasts around the HiFive Premier P550,  a board that delivers performance and features the RISC-V community was longing for.
