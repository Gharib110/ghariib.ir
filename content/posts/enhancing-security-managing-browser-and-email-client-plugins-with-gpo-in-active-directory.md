Controlling and managing plugins across various browsers and email clients is crucial for maintaining a secure enterprise environment. This blog post will explore how to effectively manage these plugins using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in an Active Directory (AD) setting, aligning with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls Version 8.

## The Importance of Plugin Management

CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets emphasizes the need to actively manage all software on the network. This includes plugins for browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and email clients such as Outlook, which can be potential vectors for security breaches if left unmanaged.

## Implementing Plugin Management with GPO

Here’s a comprehensive guide to manage plugins using Group Policy across different browsers:

1. **Create a New GPO**: In the Group Policy Management Console, create a new GPO or edit an existing one.
2. **Configure Internet Explorer Settings**:
    - Navigate to User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Internet Explorer
    - Enable “Prevent running of extensions not listed in the Add-on List”
    - Add approved extensions to the “List of Approved Add-ons”
3. **Manage Microsoft Edge Settings**:
    - Go to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Microsoft Edge
    - Enable “Control which extensions cannot be installed”
    - Use “Allow specific extensions to be installed” to whitelist approved extensions
4. **Configure Google Chrome Settings**:
    - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Google > Google Chrome > Extensions
    - Enable “Configure extension installation whitelist”
    - Add the extension IDs of approved extensions to the whitelist
5. **Manage Mozilla Firefox (requires additional setup)**:
    - Firefox requires the Firefox ADMX templates to be added to your Group Policy Central Store
    - Once added, go to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox
    - Enable “Extensions to Install” and specify allowed extensions
6. **Configure Email Client Plugins (Outlook)**:
    - Go to User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Microsoft Outlook > Security
    - Enable “Disable all COM add-ins”
    - Use the “List of Managed Add-ins” to specify allowed add-ins
7. **Apply GPO to Relevant OUs**: Link the GPO to the appropriate Organizational Units (OUs) containing user accounts and computer objects.
8. **Test and Monitor**: Apply the GPO to a test group before rolling out organization-wide. Monitor for any issues and adjust as necessary.

## Aligning with CIS Controls

This comprehensive approach aligns with several CIS Controls Version 8:

- Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets
- Control 4: Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software
- Control 7: Continuous Vulnerability Management
- Control 12: Network Infrastructure Management

By implementing these policies across various browsers and email clients, you’re taking significant steps towards a more secure and standardized environment.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Browser Diversity**: Be aware that different browsers may require different GPO settings. Ensure your policies cover all browsers used in your organization.
2. **Third-party Management Tools**: For more granular control, especially in environments with multiple browsers, consider using third-party extension management tools that integrate with GPO.
3. **Regular Updates**: Browser vendors frequently update their GPO capabilities. Stay informed about new policy options and adjust your configurations accordingly.
4. **User Education**: Implement a policy to educate users about the risks of unapproved plugins and the process for requesting new plugins if needed for work purposes.

## Regular Review and Updates

Remember to regularly review and update your plugin management policies. New plugins may need to be added to the approved list, while others may need to be removed due to emerging security concerns or obsolescence.

## Conclusion

Managing plugins across various browsers and email clients through GPO is an effective way to enhance your organization’s security posture. It provides centralized control, reduces attack surfaces, and helps maintain compliance with cybersecurity best practices across diverse software environments.
