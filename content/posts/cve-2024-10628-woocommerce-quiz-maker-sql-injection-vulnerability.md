**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-10628  
**Published :** Jan. 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 22 minutes ago  
**Description :** The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
