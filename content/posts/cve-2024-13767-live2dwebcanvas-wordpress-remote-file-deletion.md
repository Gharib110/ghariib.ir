**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-13767  
**Published :** Jan. 31, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1Â day ago  
**Description :** The Live2DWebCanvas plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ClearFiles() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).  
**Severity:** 8.1 | HIGH
