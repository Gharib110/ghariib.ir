Ventiva showed off the first laptop fully cooled by its ICE9 fanless tech at CES 2025.

Last year, we were excited to see the launch of Ventiva's wizard-like ICE9 fanless cooling technology and were wowed by their invention's ability to push massive amounts of air without making a sound. We've been eagerly awaiting a real-world implementation of this product in a laptop, and thanks to the joint efforts of Ventiva, Dell, and Intel, the company debuted a laptop cooled entirely by their ICE technology at CES 2025.
