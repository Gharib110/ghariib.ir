The Cybercrime Magazine YouTube channel has released the inaugural episode of CrowdStrike’s new Adversary Universe Podcast.

The hosts of the first episode, Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s Head of Counter Adversary Operations, and Cristian Rodriguez, Field CTO for the Americas at CrowdStrike, take a deep dive into DeepSeek and the risk of foreign large language models (LLMs).

DeepSeek took the internet by storm earlier this year, making headlines and sparking conversations about its development, use, and associated risks.

At a time when new AI models are constantly emerging, the launch of DeepSeek has led to questions and concerns around AI model security, data security, and national security. What is DeepSeek, and how was it trained? What are the risk implications of using it? Are there safe ways to explore new AI models, or should they be avoided entirely? And how worried do we need to be about data poisoning?
