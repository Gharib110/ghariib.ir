If you love reading books and have yet to experience an e-reader, we highly recommend giving it a try. Not only are you able to carry thousands of books on a single device, but it's also better for the eyes when compared to a tablet or smartphone. Of course, there are lots of different options out there, but we recommend going with Amazon's Kindle.
