If I'm honest, I was in two minds about adding additional stealer logs to HIBP. Even with the new feature to include the domains an email address appears against in the logs, my concern was that I'd get a barrage of "that's useless information" messages like I normally do when I load stealer logs! Instead, the feedback was resoundingly positive. This week I'm talking more about the logic behind this, some of the challenges we faced with it and what we might see in the future. Stay tuned, because I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of this in HIBP.

2. For the first time ever, we added a heap of additional info about stealer logs to HIBP (ok, it's just the domains an address appears against, but that turns out to have been really useful)
