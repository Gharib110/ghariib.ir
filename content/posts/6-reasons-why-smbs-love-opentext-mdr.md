In today’s digital-first world, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face cybersecurity challenges that grow more complex by the day. SMBs are prime targets for attackers hoping to gain a foothold inside any organization that doesn’t have extensive security measures. As threats increase, so does the need for comprehensive, reliable, and accessible protection.

This is where managed detection and response (MDR) services come in. MDR combines threat detection, investigation, and response, offering businesses the support from a team of security experts who monitor the environment 24/7 to identify and respond to threats. For many SMBs, MDR is an ideal solution because it provides a level of protection and expertise that would otherwise require building an in-house security operations center (SOC).

With OpenText MDR, SMBs get exactly this level of protection, backed by a trusted name in cybersecurity. Delivered through our extensive network of leading MSPs, OpenText MDR offers the power of an enterprise-grade SOC, helping SMBs fortify their defenses, protect their data, and stay operational no matter the time of day.

SMBs are turning to OpenText MDR for several key reasons that make a difference in their security approach:

## 1\. 24/7/365 monitoring and threat response

Cyber threats don’t follow a 9-to-5 schedule—they’re more likely to strike after hours or on weekends, when in-house teams may be offline. That’s why around-the-clock protection is crucial.

Working together with your MSP, OpenText provides robust, continuous protection supported by a skilled team of security experts. This around-the-clock vigilance offers invaluable peace of mind, knowing that security professionals are actively monitoring and defending your infrastructure from evolving threats, day and night.

## 2\. Fast incident response

In the face of a cyber-attack, every second matters, and a rapid response can mean the difference between a minor incident and a major disruption.

With dedicated analysts for investigation and escalation within 15 minutes, OpenText MDR collaborates seamlessly with your MSP to deliver rapid incident response within critical time frames. This swift action minimizes potential damage, safeguards business continuity, and helps companies avoid costly disruptions.

## 3\. Meet regulatory compliance requirements

Compliance can be tough, especially for SMBs with limited resources. OpenText MDR makes it easier by helping businesses meet key standards like NIST, PCI, HIPAA, and SOC 2.

With built-in security controls, reporting, and documentation, OpenText helps protect customer data, reduce risks, and keep you clear of costly fines. Plus, it frees up your team to focus on running the business, knowing that OpenText MDR is supporting your compliance requirements.

## 4\. Low total cost of ownership (TCO)

Building an in-house SOC requires a significant investment that goes beyond just the initial setup. The costs quickly add up when factoring in the specialized hardware, advanced software, and the need to recruit and retain highly skilled security professionals. For many SMBs, these expenses are simply out of reach, which makes it challenging to keep up with the level of protection needed to guard against sophisticated cyber threats.

OpenText MDR solves this by offering a fully managed or co-managed SOC-as-a-Service model through your MSP, which cuts down on costs by eliminating the need for an in-house infrastructure and dedicated security team. With OpenText MDR, businesses can optimize their security budget without sacrificing the level of protection that’s required to counteract today’s cyber threats.

## 5\. Enhanced protection beyond endpoint security

SMBs are increasingly investing in endpoint security, which is a crucial first step. However, today’s sophisticated adversaries often bypass these initial defenses, making it critical to have more than endpoint security alone.

OpenText MDR enhances an organization’s existing endpoint protection by integrating AI-driven automation, SOAR workflows, and a turnkey cloud SIEM into the security environment. This enables active monitoring and protection across the attack surface, while automating threat response and accelerating remediation times. With OpenText MDR, businesses benefit from a comprehensive, streamlined security service that operates continuously, working smarter, faster, and more efficiently to safeguard against evolving threats.

## 6\. Advanced threat intelligence and threat hunting

Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and OpenText MDR stays ahead with threat intelligence from over 35 sources worldwide. SMBs gain valuable insights into emerging threats and can protect their business with OpenText’s security experts conducting threat hunting to proactively identify and neutralize potential risks before they escalate. This intelligence-driven approach provides an essential security practice that gives businesses the edge to thwart sophisticated attacks.

Cyber-attacks can bring business operations to a grinding halt, leading to reputational damage and substantial financial loss. In this climate, having a trusted security partner like OpenText—a provider known for its reliable and innovative security solutions—is essential for businesses looking to stay secure, resilient, and prepared for whatever cyber threats may come their way.
