At SOC Prime, we foster a strong cybersecurity community by connecting researchers, enterprises, MDR providers, and government organizations. Now, individual security researchers can unlock even more benefits of collaboration and networking through the SOC Prime referral program—sharing the platform with peers and earning exclusive rewards.

Cybersecurity is a collective effort. The strongest defense comes from working together, aligning with threat-informed defense to refine strategies using real-world intelligence and military-grade tactics. By leveraging open standards like MITRE ATT&CK®, Sigma, and Roota, organizations gain transparency across tools and techniques, staying ahead of evolving threats. At SOC Prime, we make this process seamless and rewarding for security researchers.

## Invite a Friend & Get 20% Off on Individual Subscriptions

Know someone who could benefit from SOC Prime’s advanced threat detection and AI-powered detection engineering capabilities? Invite them to subscribe to Threat Detection Marketplace or Uncoder AI, and they’ll receive 20% off their first Solo subscription—whether monthly or annual—when their referred contact subscribes. Once they sign up, you’ll also receive 20% off your next Solo subscription payment.

Solo subscriptions give security researchers individual access to SOC Prime’s advanced features, previously exclusive to corporate clients. Threat Detection Marketplace Solo provides access to the global active threats feed, tailored threat intelligence, and an extensive library of Sigma rules to stay on top of attacks, with Uncoder AI Solo included. 

With Uncoder AI Solo, individual cyber defenders unlock personal access to a private IDE & co-pilot for threat-informed detection detection engineering now compatible with the 11 most common SIEM, EDR, and Data Lake languages for cross-platform translation, plus Sigma and Roota. Uncoder AI is powered by market-leading public LLMs along with SOC Prime’s private Machine Learning models trained on the world’s largest dataset of 1,000,000+ detection rules and queries, along with 13,000+ labels, and running on SOC Prime’s private cloud. Get a concise summary or an in-depth decision tree of detection logic from a dedicated private LLM, rely on AI to translate natively unsupported functions, receive inline syntax hints for quick insights into complex detection logic, and leverage unlimited AI LLM capabilities while maintaining full control over your AI interactions. 

While Solo subscriptions are now available for instant purchase via Stripe, with a 35% discount on the annual subscription, the referral program unlocks even more rewards for you while strengthening your network’s security. There’s no limit to how many people you can invite using our referral program, meaning the more you share, the more you get. It’s a win-win situation for both you and your peers. Together, we create a more resilient cybersecurity ecosystem.
