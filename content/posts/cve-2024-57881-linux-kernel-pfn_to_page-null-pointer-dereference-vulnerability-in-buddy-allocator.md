**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-57881  
**Published :** Jan. 11, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 23 hours, 50 minutes ago  
**Description :** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/page\_alloc: don't call pfn\_to\_page() on possibly non-existent PFN in split\_large\_buddy()

In split\_large\_buddy(), we might call pfn\_to\_page() on a PFN that might not exist. In corner cases, such as when freeing the highest pageblock in the last memory section, this could result with CONFIG\_SPARSEMEM && !CONFIG\_SPARSEMEM\_EXTREME in \_\_pfn\_to\_section() returning NULL and and \_\_section\_mem\_map\_addr() dereferencing that NULL pointer.

Let's fix it, and avoid doing a pfn\_to\_page() call for the first iteration, where we already have the page.

So far this was found by code inspection, but let's just CC stable as the fix is easy.  
**Severity:** 0.0 | NA
