**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-11350  
**Published :** Jan. 8, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 35Â minutes ago  
**Description :** The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the adforest\_reset\_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.  
**Severity:** 9.8 | CRITICAL
