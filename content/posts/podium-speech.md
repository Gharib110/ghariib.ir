_This is a submission for the GitHub Copilot Challenge : Fresh Starts_

## What I Built

I created a platform where users can listen to the opinions of globally admired individuals or fictional characters (using voice cloning technology) on important global issues. It also allows users to see how others are contributing in small ways to make the world a better place and provides an opportunity to join these movements.

## Copilot Experience

As a long-time GitHub Copilot user, Iâ€™ve been amazed by the recent improvements. Throughout my development process, the file chat feature helped me structure my project more effectively, while file edits made it effortless to replicate layouts with slight tweaksâ€”it felt like magic. ðŸª„

To be honest, a significant part of my development process relied on Anthropicsâ€™ Claude model (Sonnet), which was a great addition to my workflow. Finally, the classic autocomplete feature proved incredibly helpful, especially when generating comments through chat options.

## Conclusion

The experience was like sign wave in starting it feels light but in middle of fills like pressure to stuck in situation thanks to copilot issue resolved easily

Seriously speaking I thought in the beginning it just good idia but when I finished the project (well enough working) I believe it just something that I want improv, Podium speech is my favourite thing where I can get motivation to do something meaningful change in world even small in future may be there are several voices that telling us to rethink or fresh start on our daily or big decision to make world better. Activity zone ðŸ˜˜ I deeply wish to see people post their small act of kindness, (by the way I am running it on free plan ðŸ˜ž)
