**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-10932  
**Published :** Jan. 4, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 8 minutes ago  
**Description :** The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'recursive\_unserialize\_replace' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must create a staging site in order to trigger the exploit.  
**Severity:** 8.8 | HIGH
