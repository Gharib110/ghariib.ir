**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-22612  
**Published :** Jan. 24, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 3 minutes ago  
**Description :** Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.374, the missing authorization allows an authenticated user to retrieve any existing private keys on a coolify instance in plain text. If the server configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim's server configuration, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the remote server. Version 4.0.0-beta.374 fixes the issue.  
**Severity:** 10.0 | CRITICAL
