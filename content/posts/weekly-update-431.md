I fell waaay behind the normal video cadence this week, and I couldn't care less 😊 I mean c'mon, would you rather be working or sitting here looking at this view after snowboarding through Christmas?!

That said, Scott and I did carve out some time to chat about the, uh, "colourful" feedback he's had after finally putting a price on some Report URI features he'd been giving away free for years. And there's more data breaches, of course, including a couple I loaded over the previous week that I think were particularly interesting. Enjoy this week's video, next week's will be a 2024 wrap-up from somewhere much, much sunnier 😎
