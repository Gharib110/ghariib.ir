Every attack leaves a trail, but in containerized environments, this trail can evaporate before you even realize you have been attacked. These environments bring new challenges for security teams, including an expanding attack surface. Containers, while incredibly powerful, are short-lived, and attackers exploit this by moving quickly and covering their tracks. They often download and execute malware, then silently modify, or delete the files to erase evidence of their actions, making it nearly impossible to trace the original attack. Security teams are often left scrambling to piece together what happened.
