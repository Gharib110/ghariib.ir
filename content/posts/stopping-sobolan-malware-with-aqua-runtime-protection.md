Aqua Nautilus researchers have discovered a new attack campaign targeting interactive computing environments such as `Jupyter` `Notebooks`. The attack consists of multiple stages, beginning with the download of a compressed file from a remote server. Once executed, the attacker deploys several malicious tools to exploit the server and establish persistence. This campaign poses a significant risk to cloud-native environments, as it enables unauthorized access and long-term control over compromised systems.
