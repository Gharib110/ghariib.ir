Laura Marta Mantoani  
Founder of The SOC Academy

  

**Q1: Laura, could you tell us about your background in cybersecurity and what inspired you to launch The SOC Academy, particularly focusing on the VirusTotal Certification course?**  

Laura: Sure, I’d love to share more. Firstly, I studied Marketing, Business Communication and Global Markets at the University of Milan, where my passion for entrepreneurship was born. Then, I earned a second degree in engineering at the University of Malaga, where I focused on Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, as well as Reverse Engineering and Malware Intelligence. This background experience shaped my entrepreneurial spirit and particularly my enthusiasm for cybersecurity. Some of my Reverse Engineering and Malware Intelligence teachers, who were from the VirusTotal team, really opened my eyes to what you can do with VirusTotal. This experience got me thinking about how I could help others understand and use VirusTotal better, discovering all its tools and maximizing their potential. That’s why I started The SOC Academy and the VirusTotal Certification course to teach and inspire others in cybersecurity.

**Q2: Can you explain the difference between the Free course and the VirusTotal Certification course?**  

Laura: Absolutely! The Free Introduction Course is designed to provide a taste of The SOC Academy's learning experience and offer a foundational understanding of VirusTotal. They are perfect for individuals curious about VirusTotal and cybersecurity who want to explore the platform before committing to a more in-depth program. The VirusTotal Certification course, on the other hand, is a comprehensive deep dive into all aspects of VirusTotal, from basic search functions to advanced hunting techniques. It is ideal for those who want to become true VirusTotal masters and gain a recognized certification.

**Q3: The VirusTotal Certification seems to be a flagship course. What are some of the key benefits for those who complete it?**  

Laura: The VirusTotal Certification is designed not just as a course, but as a comprehensive learning experience. Those who complete the certification receive a badge on their VirusTotal.com profile, signaling their expertise to peers and potential employers, as well as an official VirusTotal certificate, that demonstrates the users' advanced level of proficiency with VirusTotal. Additionally, certified users gain unlimited access to the course with ongoing updates and early access to new features on the platform. This ensures our graduates are always at the cutting edge of cybersecurity practices.

**Q4: How does The SOC Academy ensure the courses remain relevant in the rapidly changing field of cybersecurity?**  

Laura: We continuously update our course content to reflect the latest in cybersecurity threats and defenses. Our close partnership with VirusTotal allows us to integrate the newest features and updates directly into our curriculum, providing our students with relevant and immediate knowledge they can apply in real-world situations.

**Q5: Finally, what’s next for The SOC Academy? Any future plans or developments?**  

Laura: We're always looking to expand our offerings. Future plans include more advanced courses and possibly live events to foster a greater sense of community and collaboration among our students. We also plan to incorporate more interactive and hands-on training methods to enhance learning outcomes.

At VirusTotal, we are proud to support Laura's initiative. Her passion for cybersecurity, entrepreneurial spirit, and dedication to knowledge sharing are truly inspiring. We encourage you to visit The SOC Academy, enroll in the free introductory course, and provide feedback to Laura as she continues to grow and improve this valuable platform. Together, we can foster a stronger and more knowledgeable cybersecurity community.
