# Between Two Nerds Sowing discord by being nice

<br/>

<br/>
In this edition of Between Two Nerds Tom Uren and The Grugq talk about how offensive cyber operations could do so much more than just ‘deny, disrupt, degrade and destroy’. Grugq thinks this thinking is rooted in military culture and he wonders why cyber operations are always so mean.

This episode is also available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/h09Szw8X5i0).
