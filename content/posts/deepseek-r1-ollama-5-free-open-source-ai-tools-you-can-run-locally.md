Been messing around with DeepSeek R1 + Ollama, and honestly, it's kinda wild how much you can do locally with free open-source tools. No cloud, no API keys, just your machine and some cool AI magic.

1. Page-Assist Chrome Extension - https://github.com/n4ze3m/page-assist (any model with any params)
    
2. Open Web-UI LLM Wrapper - https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui (any model with any params)
    
3. Browser use – https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use (deepseek r1:14b or more params)
    
4. Roo-Code (VS Code Extension) – https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code (deepseek coder)
    
5. n8n – https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n (any model with any params)
    
6. A simple RAG app: https://github.com/hasan-py/chat-with-pdf-RAG (deepseek r1:8b)
    
7. Ai assistant Chrome extension: https://github.com/hasan-py/Ai-Assistant-Chrome-Extension (GPT, Gemini, Grok Api, Ollama added recently)
