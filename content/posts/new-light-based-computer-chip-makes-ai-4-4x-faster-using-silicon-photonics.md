## Overview

- PhotoGAN is a new silicon-photonic accelerator for Generative Adversarial Networks
- Uses light-based computing to improve speed and energy efficiency
- Achieves 4.4x better performance than current GPU/TPU solutions
- Reduces energy consumption by 2.18x compared to existing systems
- First hardware specifically designed for GAN operations

## Plain English Explanation

Think of PhotoGAN like a specialized engine built for a specific type of race car. Regular computers use electricity to process AI tasks, but PhotoGAN uses light. This is li...
