Advantages of MongoDB (NoSQL)  
âœ… Schema-less â†’ No need to predefine structure, store flexible data.  
âœ… Fast Writes & Reads â†’ Optimized for large-scale unstructured data.  
âœ… Horizontal Scaling â†’ Supports sharding for distributing data across multiple servers.  
âœ… Better for Real-Time Apps â†’ Chat apps, IoT, logs, analytics.

When to Use SQL vs. MongoDB  
Use Case Recommended Database  
E-commerce (Orders, Payments) âœ… SQL (Transactions, ACID compliance)  
Real-Time Chat (Messages, Notifications) âœ… MongoDB (Fast inserts, flexible schema)  
Banking & Financial Apps âœ… SQL (Strong consistency, security)  
Social Media (User Profiles, Posts) âœ… MongoDB (Scalable, high read/write)  
Analytics & Logs âœ… MongoDB (Fast insertions, unstructured data)  
Inventory Management âœ… SQL (Relational data, constraints)

Aspect SQL (Sequelize) NoSQL (MongoDB Mongoose)  
Schema Fixed schema Dynamic schema  
Query Language SQL JSON-like queries  
Joins Supports joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) Uses embedding instead of joins  
Scalability Vertical scaling Horizontal scaling  
Transactions ACID-compliant Limited transaction support  
Performance Better for complex queries

Requirement Best Choice  
Structured Data, Relationships, Transactions SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL with Sequelize)  
Unstructured Data, Scalability, Fast Reads/Writes MongoDB (Mongoose, Native Driver)  
ðŸ”¹ Use SQL if your data is highly relational (e.g., banking, orders).  
ðŸ”¹ Use MongoDB for flexible schemas, real-time updates, and big data applications.
