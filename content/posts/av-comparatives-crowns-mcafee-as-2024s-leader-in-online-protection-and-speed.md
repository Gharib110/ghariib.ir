McAfee Total Protection users can feel even more secure online knowing that AV-Comparatives has named it the best in 2024 for both real-world protection and overall speed.

The two awards – the **2024 Real-World Protection Gold Award** and the **Best Overall Speed Gold Award** – underscore McAfee’s commitment to providing powerful security without compromising PC performance, a critical combination at a time **when 59% of people globally report falling victim to an online scam** or knowing someone who has, **with 87% of these individuals losing money**—an astounding average loss of $1,366 USD.

“We are honored to receive both the Best Real-World Protection and the Best PC Performance awards,” said McAfee Chief Technology Officer Steve Grobman. “AV-Comparatives is a renowned institute with a reputation for analysis and quality assurance that stands tall, and this recognition further reinforces our leadership in online protection. With our AI-powered threat protection, we remain committed to staying one step ahead of cybercriminals while having the lowest impact on PC performance, so that people can enjoy their online lives with confidence.”

### **Why McAfee Stands Out**

Each year, AV-Comparatives rigorously tests leading consumer security products to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios as well as their impact on system performance. McAfee’s standout results reflect the strength of its:

- **Real-World Protection:** AV-Comparatives’ Real-World Protection Test measures a product’s ability to combat malware under everyday conditions. Winners of this test, such as McAfee, provide high levels of protection with minimal false alarms, sparing users the stress and burden of identifying whether something is harmful.
- **Performance:** The PC Performance Test evaluates the impact of a security product on system performance. McAfee ranked with the lowest impact on PC performance throughout 2024, ensuring users can stay secure online without their devices losing speed and slowing down.
