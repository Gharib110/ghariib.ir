# Connecting People, Web Browsers and Security

The web browser has transformed significantly in recent years, becoming one of the most used tools for work today. However, as organizations adopt hybrid work models and cloud-based operations, securing this work tool has proved a challenge. Security infrastructures haven’t evolved as fast as the browser, making them prone to cyberattacks. With browsers being the primary gateway to the internet, any security lapse can lead to broad opportunities for significant data breaches and operational disruptions. Understanding the risks and implementing robust security measures is crucial for safeguarding the work we do today.

## A Critical Juncture for Web Application Usage

Even though approximately 85-100% of the average work day occurs within web browsers, many enterprises lack the security necessary to address the threats that can originate there. A recent survey by Palo Alto Networks found that 95% of respondents experienced browser-based attacks in the last year, including account takeovers and malicious extensions. This issue is particularly concerning given that businesses currently use an average of around 370 web and SaaS applications, with a 50% increase in application usage expected over the next two years. Can you guess how these work applications are accessed? Vulnerable, consumer-grade web browsers.

The repercussions of this influx of vulnerable browsers and applications in the enterprise are staggering, including financial losses and reputational damage. For example, account takeovers can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, enabling attackers to steal data from both the organization and its customers. Malicious browser extensions can introduce malware, extract data, or create backdoors for future attacks. Data breaches may lead to regulatory fines, a decline in customer trust and substantial expenses related to remediation and recovery.

As these threats become more advanced, the potential harm to businesses increases, necessitating more sophisticated and comprehensive security measures. To properly address these types of threats, it’s crucial to take a proactive approach, ensuring potential issues are addressed before a network is compromised.

## Challenges That Come with Personal Devices

The transition to a hybrid work model has resulted in the extensive use of personal devices to access corporate applications. Almost 90% of organizations allow employees to access corporate applications and data from their devices without actively considering the implications. These personal devices often lack the rigorous security controls found on corporate devices, making them attractive targets for cyberattacks. Over 80% of successful ransomware attacks come from these unmanaged devices.

Traditionally, the answer was to force virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployments to these workers – or to remove the problem altogether by shipping corporate, managed laptops to each employee and contractor globally. Both solutions can be expensive and difficult for even small organizations to manage – let alone the largest. Managed laptops in particular, often create long onboarding time, as well as offboarding difficulties when the organization needs to retrieve the laptop. Both solutions compromise the user experience and leave organizations at risk, as they don’t support least-privileged access.

A more effective solution to address unmanaged devices involves implementing a secure access service edge (SASE) framework. This enhances security by ensuring secure remote access to sensitive data and applications, protecting the organization’s network from unauthorized access. To tackle security issues with web-based work directly, a SASE-native enterprise browser enables real-time detection and prevention of threats. This also extends SASE security to unmanaged devices. Advanced threat intelligence and machine learning algorithms detect anomalies, phishing attempts, malicious file uploads and downloads and data leakage.

## Phishing Attacks and Organizational Vulnerability

Phishing remains a pervasive threat to today’s workforce, with incidents affecting 94% of organizations over the last year, despite many existing antiphishing solutions. Improving defenses against these threats is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring organizational resilience.

Organizations require tools to prevent access to malicious domains, unsafe URLs and phishing websites. Malicious websites should be identified and blocked or opened in read-only mode to ensure employees do not fall prey. And since every phishing attack involves the browser as the location with the risk of accessing the malicious page, opting for an enterprise browser with the capability to natively interact with users and warn them of potential phishing offers another effective solution. In addition, tools that enable IT visibility into employee use of unapproved websites, unsanctioned software or personal apps are also essential in protecting against risks.

## Looking at the Bigger Picture

Together, ongoing cybersecurity training for all employees in conjunction with robust security measures, like SASE, create a comprehensive defense strategy that not only safeguards company assets but also cultivates a vigilant and informed workforce. By emphasizing that “everyone can do their part” in maintaining cybersecurity, organizations empower their staff to take an active role in protecting sensitive information and contributing to a more resilient security posture. This collaboration enhances individual awareness and strengthens the organization’s overall defense against cyberthreats.

A Zero Trust architecture is crucial in today’s cybersecurity landscape. This approach assumes no inherent trust in users or devices, and it requires always verifying the user is who they say they are and that their device posture is compliant based on the organizational requirements and their location. This is especially critical for organizations working with third parties or in industries with high churn rates where the risk of compromised credentials and devices is heightened. By using a SASE-native enterprise browser, granular Zero Trust policies can be compiled directly within the browser. This allows organizations to enforce strict access policies tailored to individual user roles and behaviors, such as device status, location and even policy attributes uniquely to SaaS web apps, like the logged-in user in particular SaaS applications. This enhances security by minimizing exposure to threats, ensuring that sensitive data and resources are only accessible to authorized individuals, significantly reducing the risk of breaches and fostering a more resilient security posture.

### A Collective Effort

As organizations increasingly rely on web browsers and SaaS applications, robust cybersecurity measures are more critical than ever. The prevalence of browser-based attacks and vulnerabilities from personal devices in hybrid work environments require comprehensive strategies to protect sensitive information and maintain operational integrity. Implementing advanced solutions like a SASE-native enterprise browser that extends Zero Trust to the browser, along with ongoing cybersecurity training that empowers employees to recognize potential risks, creates a proactive defense against evolving threats. Ultimately, these strategies safeguard company assets and build resilience against the ever-changing landscape of cyberthreats.
