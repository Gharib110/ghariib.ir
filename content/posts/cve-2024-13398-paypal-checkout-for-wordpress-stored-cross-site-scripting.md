**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-13398  
**Published :** Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46Â minutes ago  
**Description :** The Checkout for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'checkout\_for\_paypal' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.32 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.  
**Severity:** 6.4 | MEDIUM
