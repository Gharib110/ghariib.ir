At DigitalOcean, we understand that efficiently scaling your infrastructure is key to delivering seamless, high-performance applications. That’s why we’re excited to introduce Droplet Autoscale Pools, a new feature that automates the scaling of your Droplets based on how they’re using resources. Droplet Autoscaling helps ensure that businesses only pay for the compute resources they need, meeting performance demands without manual scaling interventions. Whether you’re handling traffic spikes or fluctuating workloads, this feature helps you scale your infrastructure dynamically and cost-effectively, so you can focus on what matters most—building and growing your business.

**What is Droplet Autoscaling?**

Droplet Autoscaling is designed to automatically adjust the number of Droplets in your application’s pool based on CPU and memory utilization. With this new feature, you can set a minimum and maximum number of Droplets, and Autoscaling will dynamically add or remove Droplets to meet your performance requirements. Whether you’re running a web application, an e-commerce site, or a high-traffic SaaS platform, Droplet Autoscaling makes it easier than ever to ensure that your infrastructure scales automatically based on real-time demand.

**How to get started with Droplet Autoscale Pools**

Getting started with Droplet Autoscale pools is simple. You can create an Autoscale Pool directly through the DigitalOcean dashboard or API. After that, you’ll define the parameters for scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of Droplets and resource utilization thresholds. From there, Autoscaling takes over and dynamically adjusts your infrastructure as needed.

**Ready to scale?**

Whether you’re running a growing business or managing a high-traffic web app, Droplet Autoscaling makes it super simple to ensure your infrastructure is always ready to meet demand. Save time, reduce costs, and optimize performance with this powerful new feature.

Droplet Autoscaling is available for all regions (except AMS2) and will work with Dedicated CPU Droplet plans.
