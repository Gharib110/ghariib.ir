Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Endpoint Manager, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Ivanti Endpoint Manager is a client-based unified endpoint management software. Successful exploitation could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
