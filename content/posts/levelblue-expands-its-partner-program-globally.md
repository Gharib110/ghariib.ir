Businesses worldwide are challenged with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, and the need for advanced security solutions has never been greater. That’s why we’re expanding the LevelBlue Partner Program through strategic alliances to add to our strong global base of managed service providers (MSPs) managed security service providers (MSSPs) and resellers in different regions including Europe and the Middle East.

We’re excited about a new partnership with Renaissance, Ireland’s leading value-added distributor. Through this alliance, Renaissance is bringing LevelBlue’s managed security services to the Irish market, addressing the growing demand for security solutions amid rapid growth in the region.

Ireland’s MSPs and MSSPs are facing challenges in delivering complex cybersecurity services due to resource limitations. Through our collaboration, Renaissance provides Irish MSPs and MSSPs with the ability to complement their security capabilities without requiring substantial investments in building in-house capabilities.

In addition to increasing our footprint in Europe, we’re also expanding our reach within the Middle East. In October of 2024, we strengthened our collaboration with Mindfire Technologies, the largest MSSP in the Middle East. Through our joint efforts, we are bringing cybersecurity services tailored to the needs of organizations within the region, helping them to stay ahead of evolving threats and scale their security operations.

However, our expansion isn’t just about growing our own reach—it’s about fostering a stronger, more resilient cybersecurity ecosystem worldwide. By working closely with regional partners like Renaissance and Mindfire, we ensure that businesses of all sizes can access world-class cybersecurity services tailored to their specific needs.
