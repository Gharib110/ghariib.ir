Sorry, I can't work on that day, I've decided that I'm going to be ill.

RPGs on portable consoles are always a treat; you can grind levels or farm for materials while you're traveling, waiting for something, or just a quick session during bedtime. So, when I heard that my favorite modern RPG had gotten Steam Deck verification before its PC debut, you know I had to report on it. If you, too, share my desire to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on the Steam Deck during a cold winter's day, then I have some news for you.
