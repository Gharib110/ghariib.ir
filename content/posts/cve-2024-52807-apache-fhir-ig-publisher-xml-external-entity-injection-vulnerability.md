**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-52807  
**Published :** Jan. 24, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 3 minutes ago  
**Description :** The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG. Prior to version 1.7.4, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag \`( \]>\` could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.publisher is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. A previous release provided an incomplete solution revealed by new testing. This issue has been patched as of version 1.7.4. No known workarounds are available.  
**Severity:** 8.6 | HIGH
