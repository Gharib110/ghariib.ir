**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-22153  
**Published :** Jan. 23, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 26Â minutes ago  
**Description :** RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows to provide a program input into a trusted environment. Via a type confusion bug in versions of the CPython interpreter starting in 3.11 and prior to 3.13.2 when using \`try/except\*\`, RestrictedPython starting in version 6.0 and prior to version 8.0 could be bypassed. The issue is patched in version 8.0 of RestrictedPython by removing support for \`try/except\*\` clauses. No known workarounds are available.  
**Severity:** 7.9 | HIGH
