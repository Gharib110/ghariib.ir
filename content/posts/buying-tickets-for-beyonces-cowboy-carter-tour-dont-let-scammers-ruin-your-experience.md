Beyoncé has officially announced her _Cowboy Carter_ world tour, and the excitement is through the roof! With her last tour selling out in record time, fans know they need to act fast to secure their tickets. Unfortunately, that urgency is exactly what scammers prey on. 

In 2022 alone, Americans lost nearly **$8.8 billion** to fraud, and ticket scams are one of the most common ways scammers cash in on eager fans. But don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. Before you rush to buy tickets to Beyoncé’s latest tour, here’s how to spot and avoid ticket scams so you don’t get left outside the stadium with nothing but regret. 

## **How Ticket Scams Work** 

Ticket scams come in different forms, but the most common ones include: 

- **Selling fake tickets** – The scammer takes your money and either provides a counterfeit ticket or nothing at all. 

- **Stealing payment information** – Some fake ticket websites don’t just sell you bogus tickets—they steal your credit card details too. 

- **Reselling legitimate tickets multiple times** – A scammer might have a real ticket but sells duplicates of it to multiple buyers, leaving some victims locked out of the event. 

- **Selling general admission tickets as premium or VIP seats** – You think you’re getting an upgrade, but you end up overpaying for a basic ticket. 

Scammers know how to create a sense of urgency, often advertising tickets to sold-out events at too-good-to-be-true prices. If you’re desperate to see Beyoncé, it’s easy to get caught up in the rush—but staying cautious can save you from getting scammed. 

## **How to Spot a Ticket Scam** 

The best way to avoid being scammed is to buy only from reputable sources like **official ticketing platforms** (Ticketmaster, Live Nation, AXS) or directly from the event’s website. However, if you’re looking elsewhere, be on the lookout for these red flags: 

- **Deeply discounted tickets** – If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. 

- **Sellers reaching out to you first** – Scammers often message people on social media, offering “last-minute” or “hard-to-find” tickets. 

- **Payment methods with no protection** – If the seller insists on Venmo, Cash App, cryptocurrency, or gift cards, walk away. Use a credit card for protection. 

- **Look-alike websites** – Scammers create fake ticket sites that resemble legitimate ones. Always check the URL. 

- **Poor grammar and spelling** – Many scam posts and messages contain awkward phrasing or mistakes. 

- **Sellers asking to DM or text you right away** – Legitimate resellers typically operate through verified marketplaces, not private messages. 

## **Common Ticket Scam Traps & How to Avoid Them** 

### **_1\. Fake “Sold-Out” Tickets on Social Media_** 

When an event sells out, scammers flood social media with offers. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, and Craigslist are filled with fake ticket sellers. If you didn’t get tickets during the official sale, be cautious about where you’re looking. 

**Pro Tip:** Follow Beyoncé’s official social media pages and event organizers for updates. Sometimes, extra dates or official resale opportunities become available. 

### **_2\. Discounted Tickets That Seem Too Cheap_** 

Scammers often advertise tickets below face value to lure in victims. While real fans sometimes sell their tickets at a discount, it’s a huge red flag if the price is _way_ lower than expected. 

**Pro Tip:** If you’re buying from an individual, check their profile carefully. Look for signs of a fake account, such as recently created pages or multiple listings in different cities. 

### **_3\. Fake Ticket Websites_** 

Some scammers go the extra mile, creating entire websites that mimic real ticket platforms. These fake sites not only sell counterfeit tickets but may also steal your credit card information. 

**Pro Tip:** Always type in the official ticketing site’s URL manually or search for it on Google. Avoid clicking links from unknown sources, and double-check that the site uses “HTTPS” and has no misspellings in the URL. 

### **_4\. Duplicate Ticket Scams_** 

Even if you get a real ticket, that doesn’t mean it’s yours alone. Some scammers sell the same ticket to multiple people, leading to chaos when multiple buyers show up at the event. 

**Pro Tip:** Only buy from platforms that offer **verified resale tickets** with guarantees, like StubHub, SeatGeek, or VividSeats. 

### **_5\. Seat Scams_** 

Some scammers sell general admission tickets as if they were premium seats. You may think you’re getting front-row access, only to find out you overpaid for a standing-room ticket. 

**Pro Tip:** Always confirm the seat location with the seller. Many venues have seating charts available online, so check before purchasing. 

### **_6\. Ticket Takeovers_** 

Scammers hack into Ticketmaster accounts and transfer tickets to themselves, effectively locking the rightful owner out of their seats. Victims often receive a flood of emails, including notifications of ticket transfers they never authorized. By the time they realize what’s happened, their tickets are gone, likely resold by the scammer. 

**Pro Tip:** To prevent this, ensure your Ticketmaster account is secure by using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and being wary of suspicious login attempts or phishing emails.
