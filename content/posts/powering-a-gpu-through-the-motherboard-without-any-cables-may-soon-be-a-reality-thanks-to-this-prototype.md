It's a good start.

If you've ever built a PC before, you'll know what it's like to wrestle the many-headed hydra of a PSU. Not only do you have to ensure that every plug socket has a cable attached to it, but you also (or rather, should) ensure that everything is kept neat. Well, if one prototype proves successful, you may not need to attach a power cable to your GPU anymore, as people are working on powering it entirely through the motherboard.
