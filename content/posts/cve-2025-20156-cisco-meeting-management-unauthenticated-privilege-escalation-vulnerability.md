**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-20156  
**Published :** Jan. 22, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 day, 1 hour ago  
**Description :** A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Meeting Management could allow a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to elevate privileges to administrator on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because proper authorization is not enforced upon REST API users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to a specific endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrator-level control over edge nodes that are managed by Cisco Meeting Management.  
**Severity:** 9.9 | CRITICAL
