A great controller with excellent compatibility

This 8BitDo Pro 2 is one of our favorite controllers. Not only does it feel good in the hand, but it also manages to deliver great performance as well. But where it really shines is with its retro look and its versatility, with support for PC, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. While this controller usually has a retail price of $50, it can now be had for much less.
