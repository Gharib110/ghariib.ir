# Sponsored How serious attackers drive MFA adoption

<br/>

<br/>
In this Risky Business News sponsored interview, Tom Uren talks to Brett Winterford, Okta’s APAC Chief Security Officer. Brett has mined Okta’s data and finds strong evidence that organisations invest in phishing-resistant authentication methods once they know they’ve been targeted by groups that excel at social engineering (such as Scattered Spider).

Brett discussed this research at Okta’s conference, Oktane, which was held in Las Vegas on 15 to 17 October 2024.
