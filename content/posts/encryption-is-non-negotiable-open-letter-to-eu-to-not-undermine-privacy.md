At Tuta we fight for your right to privacy with encryption. But the EU is still discussing policies and law enforcement demands that threaten to break encryption. If the EU continues down this path, we at Tuta are given two choices - compromise our quantum-safe encryption, or relocate to a region that values and safeguards digital privacy. The answer for us is easy. We'd rather leave the EU than break our open source encryption. Now we have signed an open letter and together with more than 50 organizations and companies we call on the EU to uphold strong encryption and privacy rights.
