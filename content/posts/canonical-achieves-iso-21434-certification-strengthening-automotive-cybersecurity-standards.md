## Robust automotive cybersecurity

As vehicles become increasingly connected, the risks of unauthorized access, remote attacks and data breaches grow significantly. ISO 21434 provides a detailed framework for managing these risks across the entire vehicle lifecycle. For OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers, compliance is key to delivering products in a competitive marketplace.

Canonical’s ISO 21434 certification indicates its cybersecurity processes meet the rigorous standards needed to address evolving threats. Automotive partners can confidently integrate the company’s trusted solutions into their systems. 

## Certified by TÜV SÜD to deliver excellence

Canonical relied on TÜV SÜD’s deep expertise in certification and auditing to achieve ISO 21434 certification. The intensive assessment validated Canonical’s capabilities in key areas, including threat analysis, risk assessment and incident response.

The certification proves that Canonical’s cybersecurity processes comply with international standards, making it an ideal partner for OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers looking  to develop and deploy safer, more resilient automotive products.

## Shaping the future of safe, intelligent vehicles

The transformation of the automotive industry—with advancements in autonomous driving, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication and AI-powered systems—makes cybersecurity a top priority. Canonical’s certification aligns seamlessly with the company’s work on functional safety under ISO 26262 and contributions to initiatives like the Enabling Linux in Safety Applications (ELISA) project.
