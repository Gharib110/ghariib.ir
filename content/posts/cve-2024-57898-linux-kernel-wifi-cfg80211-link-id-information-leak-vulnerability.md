**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-57898  
**Published :** Jan. 15, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 2 minutes ago  
**Description :** In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up

Currently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from the valid\_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, some functions require the link ID to remain in the valid\_links bitmap. One such example is cfg80211\_cac\_event(). The flow is -

nl80211\_remove\_link() cfg80211\_remove\_link() ieee80211\_del\_intf\_link() ieee80211\_vif\_set\_links() ieee80211\_vif\_update\_links() ieee80211\_link\_stop() cfg80211\_cac\_event()

cfg80211\_cac\_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared already in cfg80211\_remove\_link(). Ultimately, WARN\_ON() is hit.

Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link clean-up.
