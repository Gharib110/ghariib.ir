"Access Everywhere."  
  

This year we're thinking about how to make information and services available to everyone. Available wherever you are, whoever you are, and usable no matter how you need to connect.  
  

Less walled gardens, more sunlight.  
  

You can read the theme story and get some visual inspiration on the DEF CON 33 Theme and Style Guide page. You can get it in a PDF on media.defcon.org. Homework assignments to get you into the vibe coming soon.  
  

We can't wait to see where you'll take it.  
  

See you at DEF CON!
