**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-24891  
**Published :** Jan. 31, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 48 minutes ago  
**Description :** Dumb Drop is a file upload application. Users with permission to upload to the service are able to exploit a path traversal vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary system files. As the container runs as root by default, there is no limit to what can be overwritten. With this, it's possible to inject malicious payloads into files ran on schedule or upon certain service actions. As the service is not required to run with authentication enabled, this may permit wholly unprivileged users root access. Otherwise, anybody with a PIN.  
**Severity:** 9.6 | CRITICAL
