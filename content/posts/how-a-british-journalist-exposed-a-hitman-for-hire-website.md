Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 15, 2025

Many people have idly fantasized about wanting to be rid of their ex, or boss, or perhaps a celebrity. But a few, motivated by hatred, jealousy or rage, have taken matters a step further.

The Times reports that a hitman-for-hire website set up on the dark web is estimated to have taken more than £400,000 from individuals who have ordered the deaths of about 175 innocent people. Unbeknown to its customers, the website is a scam by criminals — but the threat to the targets is real.

Kill List podcast, hosted by British journalist Carl Miller, launched on the subscription service Wondery+ in 2024, has shone a spotlight on an illicit dark web operation.

Variously known as Besa Mafia, Camorra Hitman and #1 Hitman Marketplace, the website has been called an “Etsy for hitmen” by producers after a four-year investigation involving five different police agencies including the Metropolitan Police, the FBI and Interpol.

Miller recently joined us on the Cybercrime Magazine Podcast for a riveting discussion on his investigation into the darknet site.
