Be careful when buying; you might snag a fake.

After Nvidia released its highly-hyped GeForce RTX 5090 cards, stockists began selling out really quickly. While we hope that at least some of those cards got into the hands of people who will put them to good use, there are some that ended up in the clutches of scalpers.
