At GitLab we have a tradition: Every year, we invite a bug bounty hunter to join us for an AMA. This year, we met with Alexander Siyou Tan, also known as ahacker1, and did a deep dive into all aspects of bug bounty hunting.

## About Alexander (ahacker1)

Alexander is passionate about hacking complex SaaS applications, with a particular interest in authorization-based vulnerabilities. Currently, he's focusing on SAML and SSO research. His hacking journey began during the Covid-19 pandemic, when he transitioned from gaming to exploring game hacks and easter eggs.

## Highlights from the AMA

Here are some of the questions AMA attendees asked Alexander, and his responses.

**What are the tools you use in your research?**

I use RubyMine as my IDE, as I find it helps with analyzing code. You can jump to different parts of the code, and that helps with efficiency and allows you to search quickly and determine interesting behavior. I used to just use BurpSuite, but not so much anymore. I mainly focus on using JetBrains to review repositories on GitLab.

**Have you explored using AI to assist in finding and/or exploiting vulnerabilities?**

Yes! When I learn about a new feature or subject, I may ask ChatGPT how it works. It may give some insights or leads – when I do SAML research I use it.

**Tell us about moving into SAML and the experience of finding the awesome bugs in that area.**

SAML is like a SaaS application within a SaaS application. There's a 100-page document on how SAML works, offering infinite possibilities. I focus on code analysis, reviewing the approximately 20 libraries available. While hacking SAML can be time-consuming due to setup and configuration, the payoff can be significant.

**What’s next after SAML? Will you keep digging?**

I will fix SAML. I want to fix libraries. Not sure what’s next - maybe SSO stuff!

### Alexander's tips for the GitLab Bug Bounty Program

Alexander offered the following advice for those interested in GitLab's Bug Bounty Program:

1. Leverage GitLab's open source nature for code analysis.
2. Study patch releases to learn reverse-engineering techniques.
3. Review GitLab's public issues and disclosed reports for insights.

### Getting to know our hacker

**What do you do when you don't hack?**

I play games, I also go out on walks and explore nature/hike. It’s a nice break from sitting at the computer.

**How long do you think you would survive in a zombie apocalypse?**

Not long. Without the internet, I don’t think I'd be able to adapt.

**Is cereal a type of soup?**

It most definitely is. It has both liquid and food in it.
