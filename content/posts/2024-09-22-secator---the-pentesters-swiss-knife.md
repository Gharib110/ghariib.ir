Feel free to request new tools to be added by opening an issue, but please check that the tool complies with our selection criterias before doing so. If it doesn't but you still want to integrate it into `secator`, you can plug it in (see the [dev guide](https://docs.freelabz.com/for-developers/writing-custom-tasks "dev guide")).

Installation
------------

### Installing secator

Pipx

```
pipx install secator
```

Pip

```
pip install secator
```

Bash

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelabz/secator/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Docker

```
docker run -it --rm --net=host -v ~/.secator:/root/.secator freelabz/secator --help
```

The volume mount -v is necessary to save all secator reports to your host machine, and--net=host is recommended to grant full access to the host network. You can alias this command to run it easier:

```
alias secator="docker run -it --rm --net=host -v ~/.secator:/root/.secator freelabz/secator"
```

Now you can run secator like if it was installed on baremetal:

```
secator --help
```

Docker Compose

```
git clone https://github.com/freelabz/secatorcd secatordocker-compose up -ddocker-compose exec secator secator --help
```

**_Note:_** If you chose the Bash, Docker or Docker Compose installation methods, you can skip the next sections and go straight to [Usage](https://github.com/freelabz/secator#usage "Usage").

### Installing languages

`secator` uses external tools, so you might need to install languages used by those tools assuming they are not already installed on your system.

We provide utilities to install required languages if you don't manage them externally:

Go

```
secator install langs go
```

Ruby

```
secator install langs ruby
```

### Installing tools

`secator` does not install any of the external tools it supports by default.

We provide utilities to install or update each supported tool which should work on all systems supporting `apt`:

All tools

```
secator install tools
```

Specific tools

```
secator install tools <TOOL_NAME>
```

For instance, to install \`httpx\`, use:

```
secator install tools httpx
```

Please make sure you are using the latest available versions for each tool before you run secator or you might run into parsing / formatting issues.

### Installing addons

`secator` comes installed with the minimum amount of dependencies.

There are several addons available for `secator`:

worker Add support for Celery workers (see \[Distributed runs with Celery\](https://docs.freelabz.com/in-depth/distributed-runs-with-celery)).

```
secator install addons worker
```

google Add support for Google Drive exporter (\`-o gdrive\`).

```
secator install addons google
```

mongodb Add support for MongoDB driver (\`-driver mongodb\`).

```
secator install addons mongodb
```

redis Add support for Redis backend (Celery).

```
secator install addons redis
```

dev Add development tools like \`coverage\` and \`flake8\` required for running tests.

```
secator install addons dev
```

trace Add tracing tools like \`memray\` and \`pyinstrument\` required for tracing functions.

```
secator install addons trace
```

build Add \`hatch\` for building and publishing the PyPI package.

```
secator install addons build
```

### Install CVEs

`secator` makes remote API calls to https://cve.circl.lu/ to get in-depth information about the CVEs it encounters. We provide a subcommand to download all known CVEs locally so that future lookups are made from disk instead:

```
secator install cves
```

### Checking installation health

To figure out which languages or tools are installed on your system (along with their version):

```
secator health
```

Usage
-----

```
secator --help
```

### Usage examples

Run a [fuzzing](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Fuzzing "fuzzing") task (`ffuf`):

```
secator x ffuf http://testphp.vulnweb.com/FUZZ
```

Run a url crawl workflow:

```
secator w url_crawl http://testphp.vulnweb.com
```

Run a host scan:

```
secator s host mydomain.com
```

and more... to list all tasks / workflows / scans that you can use:

```
secator x --helpsecator w --helpsecator s --help
```
