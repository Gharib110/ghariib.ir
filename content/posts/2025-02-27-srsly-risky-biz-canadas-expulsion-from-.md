# Srsly Risky Biz Canadas expulsion from Five Eyes would be a disaster

<br/>

<br/>
Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about the White House apparently considering kicking Canada out of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance to apply pressure on the country. It’s a terrible idea and even thinking about it undermines the strength of the alliance.

They also discuss Sweden’s proposed legislation that would order apps like WhatsApp and Signal to store messages so they could be provided under warrant to authorities. The story is a vignette of the ongoing encryption debate, but we think apps like Signal will leave the country rather than comply.

Finally, they talk about how the illicit cryptocurrency ecosystem is evolving in response to government action such as takedowns and sanctions.
