Naturalist John Muir once said, “The mountains are calling, and I must go…” I could not agree more, John.

There is something about the joy of tackling tough challenges. For me, that call has taken me from Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to Machu Picchu in Peru to Everest Base Camp in Nepal (I thought about Taylor Swift Eras tour tickets but alas was not brave enough). In my personal journeys, there is no greater joy than realizing the payoff from all your hard work by reaching the summit – except perhaps in being able to share your joy with others who are on the journey with you!

With that, I am proud to share… ![:drum:](https://hello.atlassian.net/gateway/api/emoji/a436116f-02ce-4520-8fbb-7301462a1674/1f941/path)

### Scaling New Heights with Our DevOps Platform

Just like in climbing, where every grip and foothold counts, our journey across the DevOps landscape has been all about finding the best path and working with our partners and customers to navigate changing conditions. It also requires working closely with our trusted partners and customers to navigate changing conditions.

#### Forrester: Vendors move to dominate IT management software

By Edwin Wong In IT Service Management

And oh how conditions have changed since the dawn of DevOps in 2007 (which Atlassian was at the center of, BTW). In the years that have followed, collaboration between development and IT Ops teams has become even more critical and, at the same time, more complex. Responsible for literally keeping the lights on (and much more), these teams are being asked to shoulder more work than ever and are figuring out how to use new innovations, like automation and AI, to offload mundane, repetitive tasks.

That’s why we’ve built our unified DevOps solution with the following principles prioritized:

- **One platform for** _**all**_ **teams:** Atlassian connects Dev and IT Ops teams on a single AI-powered platform to supercharge collaboration across changes, incidents, and requests—all while managing risk. But it goes beyond engineering teams. Atlassian brings together product managers, design, marketing, legal, support, and more to help companies deliver value faster across a unified system of work.

- **Empowering a better DevEx:** Atlassian is the only DevOps platform offering a native internal developer platform to help platform engineering teams create a better developer experience. Available on the Atlassian Cloud and deeply integrated with Jira, Compass provides a unified software component catalog to track all of your services and the teams working on them, default scorecards to improve security and software health, software templates for faster, compliant paths to production, and more. Together with Bitbucket’s new dynamic CI/CD pipelines and dev-friendly enhancements in Jira, our DevOps solution is helping more developers stay in the flow.

- **AI to accelerate** _**all**_ **dev workflows:** Atlassian Intelligence empowers engineering teams to remove bottlenecks across all of their tasks, so they can focus on what they love about their jobs—creativity, ownership, and tackling interesting problems. Teams can instantly get answers to questions and distill context about any issue across any team, instantly draft or summarize content, get recommendations about what to work on next, and more.

Never satisfied with “good enough,” we’re constantly advancing our solution. We’ve invested heavily to innovate across our DevOps solution, including major improvements to product discovery, planning and tracking work, source code management, CI/CD, incident management, DevSecOps, health scorecards, centralized software catalog, and more.

### Let’s Keep Climbing Together!

Today more than 300,000 companies across every industry use Atlassian’s platform to ideate, build, and run their software. But we know that the beauty of the journey is that the challenges never end. There’s always another summit ahead!

We’re committed to continuing the journey together, continuously evolving our offerings so that you can conquer your own summits.
