At DigitalOcean, we’re always working to make it easier for developers, startups, and AI-driven businesses to scale their operations with the high-powered compute they need. Today, we’re introducing Bare Metal systems based on the NVIDIA HGX H200 AI supercomputing platform, designed for high-performance AI workloads. Whether you’re training large-scale models, fine-tuning AI systems, or running real-time inference, NVIDIA H200 GPUs provide the power and flexibility to accelerate AI applications.

## Why H200?

Equipped with 8x NVIDIA HGX H200 systems, these machines deliver cutting-edge performance needed for modern AI workloads. NVIDIA H200 GPUs provide faster memory bandwidth, enhanced Tensor Core performance, and more efficient real-time inference, making them the ideal choice for large-scale AI deployments. With 141GB of HBM3e memory and a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s, you can tackle complex AI tasks more efficiently, reduce latency, and push your projects further, faster.

DigitalOcean’s Bare Metal systems powered by NVIDIA HGX H200 are built for flexibility, enabling you to use them as standalone machines or multi-node clusters. This means you can create custom AI infrastructures with full control over the hardware and software environments—perfect for training large language models (LLMs), running generative AI models, or fine-tuning proprietary systems.

## Key benefits of NVIDIA H200 GPUs include:

- **Faster Model Training:** Handle larger batch sizes and improve memory efficiency, speeding up training times.
    
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Optimize foundation models with lower compute overhead and better latency.
    
- **Enhanced Real-Time Inference:** Run transformer models with faster inference and better power efficiency.
    

## Scalable, Cost-Effective, and Ready for Deployment

Unlike many hyperscalers, our bare metal systems with NVIDIA accelerated computing come with no hidden fees, no complex billing models, and no additional bandwidth charges. Plus, we offer fast deployment with provisioning typically taking around 1-2 days, so you can start scaling your AI workloads quickly.
