See why we think Figma is better than Penpot for UX/UI design.

UX/UI prototyping tools are becoming some of the most important design software in the modern day. With lives lived with computers in our hands, apps, and responsive web design, we need more design intention than what’s been offered in previous years. With Figma, you can easily design and prototype entire websites, apps, or even presentations and small animated videos. With great power and development, it’s no wonder that Figma rules against its open-source alternative of Penpot. Although Penpot is Figma’s best alternative, the real deal is the better option for UX/UI design.
