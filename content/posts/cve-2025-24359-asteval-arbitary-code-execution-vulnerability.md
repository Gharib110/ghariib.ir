**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-24359  
**Published :** Jan. 24, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 3 minutes ago  
**Description :** ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the \`asteval\` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how \`asteval\` performs handling of \`FormattedValue\` AST nodes. In particular, the \`on\_formattedvalue\` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call \`fmt.format(\_\_fstring\_\_=val)\`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an \`AttributeError\` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its \`obj\` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.  
**Severity:** 8.4 | HIGH
