Today we’re diving into the world of application software security. Specifically, we’re talking about implementing CIS CSC Version 8, Control 16 for small to mid-sized businesses. Now, I know what you’re thinking – “Brent, that sounds like a handful!” But don’t worry, I’ve got your back. Let’s break this down into bite-sized, actionable steps that won’t break the bank or overwhelm your team.

## 1\. Build a Rock-Solid Vulnerability Response Process

First things first, folks. You need a game plan for when (not if) vulnerabilities pop up. This doesn’t have to be fancy – start with the basics:

- Designate a vulnerability response team (even if it’s just one person to start)
- Set up clear reporting channels
- Establish a communication plan for affected parties

By nailing this down, you’re not just putting out fires – you’re learning where they start. This intel is gold for prioritizing your next moves in the Control 16 implementation.

## 2\. Embrace the Power of Open Source

Listen up, because this is where it gets good. You don’t need to shell out big bucks for fancy tools. There’s a treasure trove of open-source solutions out there that can help you secure your code and scan for vulnerabilities. Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk are your new best friends. They’ll help you keep tabs on those sneaky third-party components without breaking a sweat.

## 3\. Get a Grip on Third-Party Code

Speaking of third-party components, let’s talk about managing that external code. I know, I know – it’s tempting to just plug and play. But trust me, a little due diligence goes a long way. Start simple:

- Create an inventory of your third-party software (yes, a spreadsheet works)
- Regularly check for updates and vulnerabilities
- Develop a basic process for vetting new components

Remember, you’re only as strong as your weakest link. Don’t let that link be some outdated library you forgot about.

## 4\. Bake Security into Your Development Process

Here’s where the rubber meets the road, folks. The earlier you bring security into your development lifecycle, the less headache you’ll have down the line. Encourage your devs to:

- Use linters for code quality
- Implement static application security testing (SAST)
- Conduct threat modeling during design phases

It might feel like extra work now, but trust me – it’s a lot easier than trying to bolt security onto a finished product.

## 5\. Keep Your Team in the Know

Last but not least, let’s talk about your most valuable asset – your people. Security isn’t a one-and-done deal; it’s an ongoing process. Keep your team sharp with:

- Regular training sessions (they don’t have to be boring!)
- Security awareness programs
- Informal discussions about recent incidents and lessons learned

You don’t need a big budget for this. There are tons of free resources out there. Heck, you’re reading one right now!

## Wrapping It Up

Remember, implementing Control 16 isn’t about perfection – it’s about progress. Start small, learn as you go, and keep improving. Before you know it, you’ll have a robust application security program that punches way above its weight class.
