Ultrawide monitors have been around for a while now, but they still have compatibility issues to live with.

I've been an ultrawide monitor convert ever since the Nixeus EDG 34 landed on my desk for review around the end of 2019. I love the additional space for productivity and the immersiveness of games, but I'd be lying if I said it was all smooth sailing. The 21:9 aspect ratio has been around since LG launched the EA93 Series in 2012, but even the best ultrawide monitors still suffer from a common core of annoyances. To be fair, none of them are dealbreakers, and I'll happily live with them for the extra real estate to put two browser windows side-by-side, but it's worth knowing what you're getting into when you decide to go for an ultrawide monitor.
