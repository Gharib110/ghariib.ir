Be careful where you click.

A few years ago, it became a "life hack" to add the word "Reddit" at the end of a search term for something you want help with (at least, before Google began serving Reddit posts higher than usual). The idea is that whatever problem you have, there are ten Reddit threads from days past that have threads full of troubleshooting tips, advice, solutions, and tools to fix your issue. Well, it seems that the life hack is being used against us, as scammers now use fake Reddit websites to peddle malware.
