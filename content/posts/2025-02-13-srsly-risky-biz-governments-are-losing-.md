# Srsly Risky Biz Governments are losing the crypto wars

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about Appleâ€™s refusal to obey a UK government order to provide the capability to access to encrypted iCloud data. Its the latest round in the ongoing government vs technology fights over warrant-proof encryption, and again it looks like governments will lose.

They also talk about good news in the fight against ransomware. Government actions are putting pressure on the cyber criminal ecosystem, splintering groups and even making it hard to for crooks to convert cryptocurrency to hard cash.
