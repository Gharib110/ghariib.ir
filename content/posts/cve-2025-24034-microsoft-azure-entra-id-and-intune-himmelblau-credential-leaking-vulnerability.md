**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-24034  
**Published :** Jan. 23, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 26Â minutes ago  
**Description :** Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3, Himmelblau is vulnerable to leaking credentials in debug logs. When debug logging is enabled, user access tokens are inadvertently logged, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data. Similarly, Kerberos Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGTs) are logged when debug logging is enabled. Both issues pose a risk of exposing sensitive credentials, particularly in environments where debug logging is enabled. Himmelblau versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3 contain a patch that fixes both issues. Some workarounds are available for users who are unable to upgrade. For the \*\*logon compliance script issue\*\*, disable the \`logon\_script\` option in \`/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf\`, and avoid using the \`-d\` flag when starting the \`himmelblaud\` daemon. For the Kerberos CCache issue, one may disable debug logging globally by setting the \`debug\` option in \`/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf\` to \`false\` and avoiding the \`-d\` parameter when starting \`himmelblaud\`.  
**Severity:** 3.2 | LOW
