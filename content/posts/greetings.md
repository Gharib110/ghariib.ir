# Onion Links
You can find many Onion Links [here](https://oni0n.ir)

# Search Engine 1
- A method whereby you can deploy personal dark web onion crawler
- Use ahmia open-source to implement your search engine.
- The ahmia-index and ahmia-crawler are the crucial and essential parts of the engine
- I have written a simple and crude front-end for it with flask, css, and html without Js. [front-end](https://github.com/Gharib110/ahmia-frontend)
- I have made some changes to the crawler seed list, so you can use mine if you like [ahmia-crawler](https://github.com/Gharib110/ahmia-crawler) [ahmia-index](https://github.com/Gharib110/ahmia-index)


# Search Engine 2
- A method whereby you can deploy personal dark web onion crawler
- Use this project to achieve this purpose [dark-web-engine](https://github.com/Gharib110/Darkweb-search-engine)
- The project is forked but had some issues in building its required docker containers so I have mitigated them, build them, and pushed them to docker hub
- Go to the ``built_images`` page and run it based on the ``readme.md`` file
- Alternatively, you can build it again
- Unfortunately, I could not resolve the web app issue and I think it is easy to write a simple flask app to show the data
