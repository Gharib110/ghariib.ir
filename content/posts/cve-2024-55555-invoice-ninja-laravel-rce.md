**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-55555  
**Published :** Jan. 7, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 16 hours, 35 minutes ago  
**Description :** Invoice Ninja before 5.10.43 allows remote code execution from a pre-authenticated route when an attacker knows the APP\_KEY. This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the product's repository, that have default APP\_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP\_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function.  
**Severity:** 8.8 | HIGH
