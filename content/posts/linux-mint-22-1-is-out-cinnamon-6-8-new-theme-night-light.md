Linux Mint 22.1, code-name “Xia”, is finally available to download after 1 month of beta testing.

Linux Mint 22.x is based on Ubuntu 24.04 with long term support until 2029! The first point release features **Cinnamon Desktop 6.4**, that includes new default theme with rounder design and flat style buttons.

Following GNOME and Plasma 6’s design, the start menu, indicator applets, and panel context menus in Linux Mint 22.1 are now rounder and floating away from the bottom panel, which looks more modern.

Not only the panel menus, shutdown and log out dialogues, as well as authentication pop-ups are also rounder design with flat style buttons.

Linux Mint 22.1 also remove **Gdebi** package installer, instead, it now uses new **Captain** tool for installing local `.deb` packages.

Other changes include new **CPU power mode** settings, allowing to change CPU frequency profile between **Power-Saver**, **Balance**, and **Performance** modes if your CPU support it.

Not only for configuring from Power Manager setting dialog, user can also change the power mode from the bottom right power applet.

And, XFCE and MATE users can alternatively use single command to do the job instead:

```
powerprofilesctl set POWER_MODE
```

In command, you need to replace POWER\_MODE with `power-saver`, `balanced`, or `performance`.
