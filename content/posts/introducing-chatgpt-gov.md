Today we’re announcing ChatGPT Gov, a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed to provide U.S. government agencies with an additional way to access OpenAI’s frontier models.

Agencies can deploy ChatGPT Gov in their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud or Azure Government cloud on top of Microsoft’s Azure’s OpenAI ⁠ (opens in a new window) Service. Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High).

Use of ChatGPT Gov is subject to our usage policies, like other OpenAI services.
