Developers at growing businesses face unique challenges, but building and scaling applications—whether it’s a cutting-edge AI app or a video streaming service—doesn’t have to be one of them. I’m excited to invite you to **Deploy: Scaling With Simplicity**, on January 22nd, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Deploy is DigitalOcean’s signature developer conference, now with an in-person option for more opportunities to connect and learn. Can’t join us in Austin? Don’t worry, Deploy is still available virtually as well—view the detailed agenda and register to join us today.

## Why attend Deploy?

At Deploy, you’ll learn how to simplify development workflows, enhance application performance, and unlock AI’s potential by leveraging DigitalOcean’s simple, scalable solutions. Our expert-led sessions, featuring insights from customers and partners, will bring you live demos and real world examples to give you practical takeaways you can use right away. Two dedicated learning tracks—the AI/ML Builder Track and Cloud Builder Track—give you a range of session options to choose from, and we’ll throw in a few surprises along the way you won’t want to miss.

Highlights include:

- A pre-Deploy interactive workshop showing you how to master DigitalOcean in just four hours by building a dynamic website that uses DigitalOcean’s App Platform, MongoDB, GenAI product, and autoscaling.
    
- Learn how to leverage agentic AI for your business with DigitalOcean’s newest GenAI product, which makes creating AI Agents as simple as 1, 2, 3.
    
- Hear how NoBid and partner CTO.ai reduced cloud costs by 30% when they migrated from AWS to DigitalOcean.
    
- A dive into key strategies you can use to ensure your app stays online, even when the unexpected happens.
