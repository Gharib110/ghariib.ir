As quantum computing leapfrogs at great speed, the spotlight is now on post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Recently, NIST released the first three PQC encryption algorithm standards, urging organizations to test the new algorithms and prepare their cryptographic infrastructures for the inevitable shift to quantum-resistant methods. This push for PQC readiness is driven by a growing concern \[…\]
