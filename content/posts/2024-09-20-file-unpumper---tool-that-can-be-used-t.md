`file-unpumper` is a powerful command-line utility designed to clean and analyze Portable Executable (PE) files. It provides a range of features to help developers and security professionals work with PE files more effectively.

  

Features
--------

-   **PE Header Fixing**: `file-unpumper` can fix and align the PE [headers](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Headers "headers") of a given executable file. This is particularly useful for resolving issues caused by packers or obfuscators that modify the [headers](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Headers "headers").
    
-   **Resource Extraction**: The tool can extract embedded resources from a PE file, such as icons, bitmaps, or other data resources. This can be helpful for reverse engineering or analyzing the contents of an executable.
    
-   **[Metadata](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Metadata "Metadata") [Analysis](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Analysis "Analysis")**: `file-unpumper` provides a comprehensive analysis of the PE file's metadata, including information about the machine architecture, number of sections, timestamp, subsystem, image base, and section details.
    
-   **File Cleaning**: The core functionality of `file-unpumper` is to remove any "pumped" or padded data from a PE file, resulting in a cleaned version of the executable. This can aid in [malware](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Malware "malware") analysis, reverse engineering, or simply reducing the file size.
    
-   **Parallel Processing**: To ensure efficient performance, `file-unpumper` leverages the power of parallel processing using the `rayon` crate, allowing it to handle large files with ease.
    
-   **Progress [Tracking](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Tracking "Tracking")**: During the file cleaning process, a progress bar is displayed, providing a visual indication of the operation's progress and estimated time remaining.
    

Installation
------------

`file-unpumper` is written in Rust and can be easily installed using the Cargo package manager:

```
cargo install file-unpumper
```

Usage
-----

-   `<INPUT>`: The path to the input PE file.

### Options

-   `--fix-headers`: Fix and align the PE headers of the input file.
-   `--extract-resources`: Extract embedded resources from the input file.
-   `--analyze-metadata`: Analyze and display the PE file's metadata.
-   `-h, --help`: Print help information.
-   `-V, --version`: Print version information.

Examples
--------

1.  Clean a PE file and remove any "pumped" data:

`bash file-unpumper path/to/input.exe`

1.  Fix the PE headers and analyze the metadata of a file:

`bash file-unpumper --fix-headers --analyze-metadata path/to/input.exe`

1.  Extract resources from a PE file:

`bash file-unpumper --extract-resources path/to/input.exe`

1.  Perform all available operations on a file:

`bash file-unpumper --fix-headers --extract-resources --analyze-metadata path/to/input.exe`
