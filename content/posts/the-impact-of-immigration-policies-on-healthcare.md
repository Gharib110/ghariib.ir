Healthcare systems in high-income countries are at breaking point. An ageing population, soaring demand for services, and widespread burnout among professionals have created a perfect storm.

According to a report by BMJ Global Health, it is estimated that 13.7 million new health workers will be needed by 2030 globally to compensate for attrition due to retirements.

The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted the Global North’s dependencies on immigration, as shortages significantly worsened by the disruption of international mobility.

Highly skilled Immigration (as opposed to lower-skilled immigration) is emerging as a vital lifeline to tackle healthcare workforce shortages, but it’s far from a straightforward solution. The debate is tangled with complex questions about immigration policies, integration, and equity.

This article delves into the challenges, explores immigration as a remedy, and examines what it means for the future of healthcare.

### **Healthcare Workforce Challenges in the Global North**

Healthcare systems in the Global North are under immense pressure as they contend with the challenges of an ageing population. As life expectancy rises, older populations require more medical care with median ages between 41 to 49 for G7 economies, leading to an unprecedented increase in demand for healthcare services.

Simultaneously, fertility rates have continuously tumbled in the past twenty years and are now below the replacement ratio of 2.1 (UK and Europe between 1.1 to 1.6), with the UK falling the fastest. As a consequence, there are now 2 people leaving the workforce for everyone joining, and given that a significant portion of the healthcare workforce is nearing retirement age, further straining already stretched resources. This dual challenge exacerbates existing shortages and leaves healthcare systems struggling to maintain service levels. The pressures on the remaining workforce are immense, resulting in widespread burnout and a concerning wave of resignations, as many healthcare professionals leave the sector in search of less demanding roles. 

Furthermore, domestic training pipelines are unable to keep pace with these needs. The time, resources, and infrastructure required to train new healthcare professionals mean that education systems consistently fall short of producing enough skilled workers, leaving critical gaps in the workforce, with parts of the UK documenting falls of over 40% in nursing school admissions (source). 

Desperate hospitals and organisations have resorted to relying heavily on temporary frontline workers, with the UK’s NHS spending more than £10bn a year on agency and locum staff. This is both financially unsustainable and undermines the quality of care hospitals can provide.

Together, these factors have created a crisis that demands urgent and innovative solutions.

These challenges have created a reliance on overseas workers, and immigration policies have become a critical factor, either enabling or obstructing the recruitment of much-needed healthcare professionals from abroad.

### **Immigration as a Solution**

Countries have increasingly turned to international recruitment to address their healthcare workforce shortages. For example, according to a 2023 report by the UK’s NHS, 265,000 out of 1.5 million workers in the healthcare system are of foreign nationality, with workers from India, the Philippines and Nigeria making up a large portion of this number.

Skilled Immigration brings a range of benefits to the healthcare sector, making it an essential strategy for addressing workforce shortages. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to rapidly expand the workforce by recruiting skilled professionals who are ready to step into critical roles without the lengthy delays associated with domestic training pipelines. Beyond filling gaps, a multicultural workforce also enriches patient care by bringing diverse perspectives and cultural competencies, which are particularly valuable in serving increasingly diverse patient populations. Additionally, immigration offers a cost-effective solution for healthcare systems, as training domestic healthcare workers is a time-intensive and expensive process. By recruiting qualified professionals from abroad, healthcare organisations can save both time and resources while addressing immediate staffing needs. 

Together, these factors highlight the vital role immigration plays in strengthening and sustaining healthcare systems.

### **Addressing Ethical and Socio-Political Considerations**

Addressing the ethical and socio-political considerations surrounding immigration in the healthcare sector is a complex yet crucial endeavour. International recruits often encounter cultural and linguistic barriers upon relocation, which can hinder their integration into the workforce and, in some cases, impact their ability to deliver care effectively. These challenges underscore the importance of robust support systems to help recruits adapt to their new environment. Public perceptions also play a significant role, as national politics and public sentiment can influence attitudes towards the recruitment of overseas workers. Concerns about prioritising domestic self-reliance in healthcare often dominate debates, with some arguing that greater investment in domestic training programmes is a more sustainable long-term solution. 

However, stringent immigration policies can significantly undermine efforts to address workforce shortages. Visa restrictions, lengthy application processes, and caps on immigration quotas can delay or even prevent skilled professionals from joining the healthcare system, exacerbating existing challenges. 

Balancing these ethical and socio-political factors is essential to create a fair, effective, and inclusive approach to tackling the healthcare workforce crisis.

### **Toward Sustainable Solutions**

Navigating the intersection of immigration policies and healthcare requires a multi-faceted approach that balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability. Comprehensive support systems for migrant workers are essential, including orientation programmes, language training, and ongoing assistance to help international recruits integrate smoothly into their workplaces and communities. Such measures not only prevent exploitation but also promote the well-being and retention of the workforce. 

At the same time, countries must invest in expanding domestic training pipelines to reduce their reliance on foreign-trained professionals and address chronic vacancies sustainably. Governments and healthcare organisations must adopt ethical recruitment practices to ensure fairness and minimise harm to source countries. The World Health Organisation’s Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel offers a framework for supporting health system strengthening in low-income countries.

Technology is poised to play a transformative role in the future of healthcare, particularly by enhancing transparency and efficiency in recruitment processes. AI-driven tools, in particular, have influenced how governments and healthcare organisations identify and attract talent, streamlining operations and improving decision-making in an increasingly complex sector.

Finally, policymakers must work to address public sentiment, actively combating misconceptions and promoting the vital contributions of immigrant workers to healthcare systems. By fostering inclusivity and shifting narratives, they can build public trust and support for these essential reforms.

While immigration offers a vital solution to the healthcare workforce crisis, it is not without its complexities. A strategic, balanced approach is essential – one that addresses immediate staffing shortages while also investing in long-term sustainability through domestic training and robust support systems for migrant workers. Ethical recruitment, alongside policies that foster inclusivity and tackle public misconceptions, will ensure a stronger, more resilient healthcare system for the future. 

The time to act is now – only by navigating these challenges effectively can we safeguard the quality of care for generations to come.
