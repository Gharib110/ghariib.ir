Like many other data brokers, Gravy is a company you may never have heard of, but it almost certainly knows a lot about you if you’re a US citizen.

Data brokers come in different shapes and sizes. What they have in common is that they gather personally identifiable data from various sources—from publicly available data to stolen datasets—and then sell the gathered data on. Gravy Analytics specializes in location intelligence, meaning it collects sensitive phone location and behavior data.

One of the buyers is the US government who increasingly circumvents the need to get a warrant by simply buying what they want to know from a data broker. Ironic, given that the FTC sued Gravy Analytics after saying it routinely collects sensitive phone location and behavior data without getting the consent of consumers.

In the complaint last month, the FTC claimed:

> “Respondents {Gravy Analytics and Venntel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gravy Analytics) have bought, obtained, and collected precise consumer location data and offered for sale, sold, and distributed products and services created from or based on the consumer location data.”

Data brokers have drawn attention this year by leaking several large databases, with the worst being the National Public Data leak. The data breach made international headlines because it affected hundreds of millions of people, and it included Social Security Numbers.

And now, apparently, it’s Gravy Analytics’ turn to be breached. According to 404 Media, cybercriminals breached Gravy Analytics and stole a massive amount of data, including customer lists, information on the broader industry, and location data harvested from smartphones which show peoples’ precise movements.

The cybercriminals claim to have stolen 17TB of data and are threatening to publish the data. Considering the sensitivity of location data for some groups, this breach could potentially be just as significant as the National Public Data leak.

To prove their possession of the data, the cybercriminals have shared three samples on a Russian forum, exposing millions of location points across the US, Russia, and Europe.

The researcher that posted this map extracted the names of 3455 apps that leaked this information. Many of these apps are games, but we also noted Tinder and a host of apps that are promoted as TikTok video downloaders.

404 Media reports that the personal data of millions of users is affected.

The Gravy Analytics website is down at the moment of writing and nobody at the company has answered any queries with an official reaction.

The whole ordeal, whether the data will be published or not, proves once again why data brokers should stop trading health and location data.
