Following up my previous blog post, I decided to create a curated list of iOS Forensics References, organized by folder with specific references (links to blog post, research paper, articles, and so on) for each interesting file.Â 

The list is available as a GitHub repository to make it easier to keep it updated. If you have any proposal for addition in terms of file/folders or a specific reference, please let me know and I'll be happy to add it to the list.
