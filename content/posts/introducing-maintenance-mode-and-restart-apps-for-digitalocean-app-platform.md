We’re excited to announce two powerful new features for DigitalOcean’s App Platform: **Maintenance Mode** and **Restart Apps**! These updates give you greater flexibility and control over your applications, making it easier than ever to manage maintenance tasks and optimize performance.

## Maintenance Mode: Seamless Maintenance, Minimal Disruption

Maintenance Mode allows you to temporarily take your app offline while ensuring users are informed. Instead of users encountering errors or incomplete updates, they’ll see a maintenance page on your app’s home screen.

This feature is ideal for the following use cases:

- Performing database migrations.
- Halting incoming traffic while you troubleshoot your app.
- Rolling out critical updates.
- Managing maintenance windows with minimal user disruption.

### How to Enable Maintenance Mode:

1. Navigate to the **App Settings** in the App Platform dashboard.
    
2. Toggle the Maintenance Mode option to “On.”
    
3. Your app will immediately enter maintenance mode, and users will see a standardized maintenance message.
    
    **Note:** Maintenance messages are currently standardized and not customizable. Apps remain billable during Maintenance Mode.
    

## Restart Apps: Quick Recovery and Updates

Have you ever needed to restart your app to resolve unexpected issues or refresh performance? With the Restart Apps feature, you can now reboot your applications directly from the dashboard in seconds.

### Benefits of Restart Apps:

- Recover more quickly from app performance issues.
- Help ensure optimal performance with minimal disruption.

### How to Restart Your App:

1. Go to the **App Dashboard** in App Platform.
2. Locate the app you want to restart.
3. Click the **Restart App** button to reboot your application seamlessly.

## Designed with Customer Feedback in Mind

These features address real-world needs from our customers providing more granular control over their App Platform deployments. Previously, developers often faced unnecessary workarounds when managing demo applications, or maintenance windows. With Maintenance Mode and Restart Apps, app management is now faster and simpler.

## Take Control of Your Apps

With Maintenance Mode and Restart Apps, DigitalOcean App Platform now offers greater flexibility for managing your applications. Whether you’re handling maintenance tasks or ensuring smooth performance, these tools help make it easier to stay in control.
