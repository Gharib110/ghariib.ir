We’re covering all of the notable updates introduced in this Early Access Program in our dedicated 2025.1 EAP blog section. Below are the highlights from this week’s release.

## Kotlin 

### Java-to-Kotlin auto-conversion with copy-paste in K2 mode

We are getting closer to reaching feature parity between K2 and K1 modes. K1 mode’s auto-conversion for Java code in Kotlin files is a popular feature that makes it easier to cross the barrier between the two languages. Now, in K2 mode, you can also paste Java code and have it automatically translated to Kotlin. If you want to add a Kotlin file to your Java project, Kotlin will also be configured automatically.

## Frameworks and technologies

### Support for Liquibase in the _Logical_ code structure view

We’ve improved the _Logical_ code structure view introduced in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3, expanding it to support additional file types. With IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 EAP 3, you can now enjoy a more meaningful structure representation and streamlined navigation tailored specifically for Liquibase change sets. Easily explore and manage your change sets with an intuitive overview that highlights their logical hierarchy, helping you stay organized and productive when working on database schema changes.

### Code completion for nonexistent Spring Data repositories 

IntelliJ IDEA now helps you write code with even fewer distractions by automatically creating Spring Data repositories for you. Simply start typing the entity name, and if the repository doesn’t exist, the IDE will suggest creating one. Choose the repository type and seamlessly continue your work by adding derived query methods and processing the extracted data.
