In the past decade, detection engineering has evolved from a niche skill into a core function of cybersecurity, underscoring the growing demand for specialized expertise across a wide range of technologies. As organizations work to enhance their detection workflows and tackle the increasing complexity of cyber threats, AI and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape. Uncoder AI blends cutting-edge machine learning and automation with collective industry expertise, acting as a powerful co-pilot for security teams. 

The latest Uncoder AI upgrade aligns with the growing adoption of threat-informed defense, a strategic approach that emphasizes continuous improvement in cybersecurity backed by the combined expertise of the Blue, Red, and Purple teams. This approach focuses on refining defense strategies based on real-world threat intelligence and military-grade tactics, ensuring that organizations can adapt to emerging threats. By leveraging open standards, like MITRE ATT&CK®, Sigma, and Roota, organizations can ensure transparency across multiple tools and techniques, being able to anticipate, detect, and respond to the actions of highly sophisticated attackers.

With the new Uncoder AI release, security teams are empowered to create more effective, adaptive, and future-proof detection rules, driving smarter cybersecurity strategies and responding to threats with unparalleled speed & efficiency.

## Industry-First Cybersecurity Coding Co-Pilot. Yours

SOC Prime introduced Uncoder.IO in 2018 as a fast, private, and easy-to-use online translation engine for Sigma rules, ensuring 100% privacy for its users. Built on an open-core, Apache 2.0 codebase, Uncoder started as a tool for translating Sigma rules into 44 languages across SIEM, EDR, and Data Lakes.

Now, Uncoder AI has evolved into an industry-first IDE and co-pilot for detection engineering. It automates cross-platform rule and query translation across various SIEM, EDR, and Data Lake languages, including Sigma and Roota. Additionally, it serves as a powerful assistant for automated CTI enrichment, ATT&CK tagging, rule verification, and seamless IOC-to-query conversion, streamlining workflows for security teams.

### Expertise in Every Major Cybersecurity Language: Understand & Optimize Any Detection Code

In today’s multi-solution cybersecurity landscape, mastering every SIEM, EDR, or Data Lake language is a challenge. With its March 2025 release, Uncoder AI empowers security professionals to understand, analyze, and optimize detection logic across all major technologies.

Powered by market-leading public LLMs, such as OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Llama along with SOC Prime’s private Machine Learning models trained on the world’s largest dataset of 1,000,000+ detection rules and queries, along with 13,000+ labels and running on SOC Prime’s private cloud, Uncoder AI provides broad options for detection code mastering. Automatically detect the language of your code and gain a concise summary or an in-depth decision tree—all within a private, user-controlled environment, to comply with rigorous requirements on data privacy and IP protection, much needed by modern enterprises, MDR providers, and government organizations.

While LLM models normally limit your prompts, Uncoder AI removes restrictions—offering unmetered LLM AI prompts with instructions optimized for data privacy and detection engineering efficiency, directly from the UI, with no limits on chat sessions or tokens. 

Starting your code from scratch? Uncoder AI also provides unlimited code autocompletion and templates—with no AI here, yet powered by the largest dictionary of detection rules in the world, which can be enriched with your own custom chapters. Stay flexible with on-the-fly rule customization for your SIEM data schema and streamline workflows with Roota and Sigma rule templates.

### Simplify Your Migration: Make Your Detection Code Portable to Any Chosen SIEM & EDR Language

The latest Uncoder AI upgrade unlocks more advanced capabilities for cross-platform detection rule translation, giving security teams the freedom to migrate, learn, and adapt to new technologies effortlessly. Even for queries with complex logic and multiple functions, Uncoder AI intelligently analyzes and translates unsupported functions using AI-powered enhancements. Need clarity on a function? Uncoder AI provides inline and modal syntax hints, helping detection engineers to understand every bit of detection logic at a glance, discover, and learn new things specializing in multiple languages. What took weeks of expensive offline training bootcamps before, is now possible remotely, at your own pace, with the convenience of an interactive web experience, tapping into the collective knowledge, open frameworks, open-code bases, and optional LLM suggestions.

![Use Uncoder AI for inline and modal syntax hints to understand every bit of detection logic at a glance.](https://socprime.com/wp-content/uploads/Uncoder_AI_hints.png)

As of release, the following 11 languages are supported for cross-platform translation, addressing the need for detection engineers to work with market-leading SIEM, EDR, and Data Lake technologies, as well as generic rule formats such as Sigma & Roota:

- Splunk
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Google SecOps
- AWS Security Lake (Athena)
- IBM QRadar
- CrowdStrike Endpoint Security
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Falcon LogScale (ex-Humio SIEM)
- AWS OpenSearch
- Elastic Stack
- FortiSIEM

While the SOC Prime team is working on adding more languages to the full compatibility list, you can begin to future-proof your detection rules and your career opportunities during the migration process already today with the power of Sigma. Per SOC Prime’s analytics, over 11,000 organizations worldwide have used, and are using Sigma rules as the main detection language. Uncoder AI takes a Sigma-first approach, where each specific language is always translated into all supported features of the Sigma language, thus extracting the core value of detection logic. This helps to ensure your rules remain platform-agnostic and migration-ready—preserving your detection logic across any security stack. LLM kicks in optionally for functions that are not, yet, supported by Sigma rules. By nature, those functions are not sensitive, so the risk of sharing them with public AI services while decoupled from detection logic is minimal. For more sensitive environments, SOC Prime is working on the “Bring Your Own LLM” architecture, which will be available shortly.

There are also more conversion perks. Uncoder AI enables turning OSINT threat intelligence into actionable queries in seconds. It auto-parses threat reports and IOC files, instantly generating custom queries for your SIEM or EDR—ready to run with zero manual effort. Stay ahead of threats with seamless, one-click IOC-to-query conversion.

### Privacy-First: Unlimited AI/LLM Capabilities Completely Under Your Control

AI in cybersecurity is powerful—but only when used with control and precision. While Agentic AI application is certainly on the rise and has its uses, at SOC Prime, we have a different philosophy: cybersecurity is more critical than ever, and we need defenders to have more control, transparency, predictability, and privacy. Agentic AI by its definition can not adhere to these principles, and makes it sound like a shortcut. And we are not taking shortcuts in threat-informed detection engineering. Uncoder AI takes a privacy-first approach, offering cutting-edge open-source and private LLMs as optional opt-in plugins—completely under your control.

With Uncoder AI, every byte sent to an LLM is first verified by the user. You decide what to send, when to send it, and whether to enable AI functionality at all. Out of the box we ship Uncoder AI with models like LLama 8B for personal and 70B for enterprise and MDR use, available since launch and customized for threat-informed detection engineering purposes directly on SOC Prime’s private cloud dedicated servers, ensuring security without compromising efficiency.

Rather than relying on fully autonomous AI responses, Uncoder AI augments human expertise—boosting precision, speed, and decision-making while keeping you in control. AI provides deeper insights and broader visibility, while human intelligence ensures contextual accuracy. This balance creates a cybersecurity co-pilot that empowers, rather than replaces, the analyst—to deliver smarter, more efficient threat detection and response.
