title: "Building a culture of security: AWS partners with the BBC"

Cybersecurity isn’t just about technology—it’s about people. That’s why Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnered with the BBC to explore the human side of cybersecurity in our latest article, _The Human Side of Cybersecurity: Building a Culture of Security_, available on the BBC website.

In the piece, we spotlight the AWS Security Guardians program and how it helps security enable your business, not slow it down. Through the program, teams are provided tools, resources, and guidance to help address security concerns at every step of development. This enables developers to make the right decisions and embed security deeper in their solutions. Using our approach with their Security Champions initiative, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia shared how the program has helped transform their company culture and give ownership of services and security directly to their teams.

AWS and the Commonwealth Bank sought to understand how they could foster a culture where employees not only understand security, but care about it. They both needed a way to support new technology innovation while reducing security remediation work. This challenge offered both companies an opportunity to try something new with their Security Champions programs, enabling security expertise to be distributed across their respective organizations, which created a scalable solution with measurable results.
