AWS is aware of CVE-2022-1471 in SnakeYaml software, included in DynamoDB local jar and Docker distributions from version 1.21 and version 2.0. If leveraged, this issue could allow an actor to perform remote code execution using the SnakeYaml's Constructor(), as the software does not restrict the types that can be instantiated during deserialization. AWS has found no evidence that this issue has been leveraged, however, customers should still take action. On November 6, 2024, we released a fix for this issue. Customers should upgrade DynamoDB local to the latest version: v1.25.1 and above, or 2.5.3 and above.
