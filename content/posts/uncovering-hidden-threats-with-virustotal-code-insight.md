In the constantly changing world of cybersecurity, generative AI is becoming an increasingly valuable tool. This blog post shows various examples that elude traditional detection engines yet are adeptly unveiled by Code Insight. We explore diverse scenarios, ranging from firmware patches in DJI drones that disable red flight lights, to the covert theft of WhatsApp session cookies, phishing targeting Tesla customers, automated login attempts on the Medtronic CareLink Network, Bitcoin wallet attacks, Tik-Tok viewbots, unauthorized Netflix account access, cheaters for Roblox, and automation of Tinder’s match-making, along with a range of other scenarios.

Code Insight, based on Google Cloud Duet AI, was unveiled at RSA Conference 2023 as a novel feature of VirusTotal. It's specialized in analyzing code snippets and generating reports in natural language from a cybersecurity and malware expert's perspective. Since its introduction, millions of files have been analyzed by Code Insight. The reports generated are readily accessible for consultation and can be leveraged through the VirusTotal Enterprise service for large-scale result aggregation and exploitation. This functionality allows security teams to quickly and efficiently examine vast amounts of code, pinpoint potential threats, and enhance their overall security posture.

Let's delve into some intriguing anecdotal examples that demonstrate how we can uncover threats by utilizing the reports generated by Code Insight. These instances not only showcase the tool's analytical strength but also illustrate the practical applications of its findings in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Imagine working on the cybersecurity team at Roblox and wanting to explore what Code Insight has discovered. A simple query in VT Enterprise, such as **codeinsight:Roblox**, would yield more than 2,000 related files.

Continuing from the previous exploration with Code Insight, let's focus even more closely. Say you're an Anti-Cheat Software Engineer at Roblox interested in the "Murder Mystery 2" game. By refining your search in VT Enterprise to **codeinsight:Roblox AND codeinsight:"Murder Mystery 2" AND codeinsight:cheat**, the results are much more specific. This refined query leads to a fascinating find - a single file.

Initially received by VirusTotal as a text file, Code Insight correctly classifies it as a Lua script and provides a detailed report on its functionality. This example demonstrates Code Insight's precision in identifying and analyzing content within a specific context, proving invaluable for targeted cybersecurity investigations.

Shifting our focus, let's say we are now investigating a technique used to modify the firmware of DJI drones that turns off LED lights during flight. To discover if Code Insight has identified such modifications, we could use a targeted VT Enterprise search: **codeinsight:DJI AND codeinsight:firmware AND codeinsight:lights**. Voilà, the search results reveal this:

As the previous examples demonstrate, locating interesting samples through the “codeinsight:” operator is remarkably easy. This is largely due to the fact that the searches are conducted within the natural language reports generated by AI, which analyze the code and functionality of files. This approach significantly simplifies the task of finding relevant cybersecurity threats.

Next, we'll present more intriguing cases that have been detected using Code Insight, further showcasing its effectiveness in the cybersecurity landscape: .
