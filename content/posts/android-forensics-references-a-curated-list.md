During the forensic analysis of a mobile device, we often have the need to understand the content of a specific file or folder. This is particularly true when a file or a folder is not parsed by our set of tools.Â 

Our approach is, typically, to start googling the file or folder name to check if someone else has already done some researches on it. This approach is time consuming and it's not always easy to quickly find the proper reference. I also realized that I googled the same file/folder name multiple times.....

So, I decided to create a curated list of Android Forensics References, organized by folder with specific references (links to blog post, research paper, articles, and so on) for each interesting file. I plan to realize in a near future a similar page for iOS.

The list is available as a GitHub repository to make it easier to keep it updated. If you have any proposal for addition in terms of file/folders or a specific reference, please let me know and I'll be happy to add it to the list.
