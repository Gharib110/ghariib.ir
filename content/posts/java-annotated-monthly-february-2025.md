Welcome to this latest edition of Java Annotated Monthly! As we start 2025, we bring you a roundup of the latest advancements in the world of tech. Stay in the loop with a curated list of must-attend events coming up in February, so you can plan your next learning and networking opportunities. Plus, we’re thrilled to introduce Isabel Garrido to our _Featured Content_ section – packed with handpicked articles, insights, and thought-provoking reads to keep you inspired. Let’s dive in and explore what’s shaping the technological ecosystem!

## Featured Content

Isabel Garrido is a Spanish software engineer, JBCC, and speaker. She has worked in the development of high-traffic APIs for several industries using different languages in the JVM ecosystem and is currently focused on building backend systems with Java. Isabel is deeply passionate about designing resilient systems, writing clean and maintainable code, extreme programming, and testing.

I’m excited to share this month’s featured content with you!

I learn a lot from audiovisual content, much more than from reading. That’s why I love attending conferences, and this brings me to my first suggestion: 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know. During this talk, Trisha Gee and Kevlin Henney introduce their well-known book, _97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know_, in a fun way. The speakers explained they intentionally included contradictory perspectives in the book because software development is all about trade-offs. Together with Emily Bache and Holly Cummings, they discuss key topics like knowing your IDE, writing stellar unit tests, approval testing, readable code, and understanding the garbage collector.

My second recommendation is another talk: Historical Oddities & Persistent Itches. In this session, James Gosling reflects on several Java topics and how his opinion has evolved since the beginning of the language until now. One fascinating topic he developed is why the language uses braces and why he wouldn’t be using them for a language nowadays. If you’re curious about the reasoning behind Java’s design choices, this talk is a must-watch.

My final recommendation is an article about a topic that might already be familiar to some of you: “Bugs Caused by Week-Based Year Formatting in Java”. A few years ago, I learned a painful lesson during the holidays: The invoice system of an application I worked on failed in the last week of the year. We used _YYYY_ instead of _yyyy_ in date formatting, which caused incorrect year values for that week. The article explains why this happens. I hope it saves you time and energy!
