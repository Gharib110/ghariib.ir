You won't find a better price for this drive

Portable SSDs are generally a great investment if you're looking to store your data externally and need lightning-quick access. The only catch is that they usually don't offer tons of storage space, limited to around 8TB if you're looking at consumer-facing products. For most, that's going to be enough, but if you need much more, and are looking to really back everything up, then this Seagate 20TB external HDD is going to be the perfect solution.
