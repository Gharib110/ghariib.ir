Kotlin Multiplatform is growing rapidly, with its ecosystem expanding and the number of libraries increasing by 35% in 2024 alone. However, with more libraries available than ever, finding the right one for your use case and target platforms can still be a challenge. Whether you’re looking for a solution to handle permissions on iOS and Android or searching for a Compose Multiplatform calendar component that supports both mobile and web, the challenge isn’t just finding one library – it’s having all of the options clearly presented so you can compare and choose the best fit. Today, we’re excited to introduce klibs.io – our new service designed to make finding Kotlin Multiplatform libraries faster and easier.

## What is klibs.io?

Klibs.io is an easy web service that allows you to find a Kotlin Multiplatform library for a specific purpose that supports selected platforms (JVM, Android JVM, Wasm, JS, Kotlin/Native). The website indexes data from GitHub and Maven Central and uses AI-generated metadata to enhance search results. It aims to make it easier to evaluate libraries by providing KMP-related information.

With klibs.io, developers will spend less time searching and more time building, while library authors benefit from increased visibility for their work. Learn how to make your library visible on klibs.io.

## What’s next for klibs.io?

While klibs.io is already live as an alpha version, this is just the beginning. We already have a significant backlog of ideas, including features for both developers and library authors. However, before moving forward, we want to hear from our Kotlin Multiplatform users.
