###### _This week in cybersecurity from the editors at Cybercrime Magazine_

How’s this for a resume?

Adam Marre designed a video game when he was eight years old.

Marre worked as a video game developer at Disney Interactive Studios for five years early in his career, and then spent nearly 12 years at the FBI.

Today he’s running with the pack as CISO at Arctic Wolf, a hot cybersecurity company with 10,000 customers in 30 countries.

“The more each individual person knows about security … the more secure the entire organization is going to be” Marre told us on an episode of CTRL-ALT-HACKED, a Cybercrime Magazine Podcast series.

Marre was exposed to gaming on a Commodore 64, an 8-bit home computer that hit the market in Jan. 1982.

One in 10 video game developers were laid off in 2024, according to research released at the recent Game Developers Conference. Marre says ex-gaming pros might feel right at home in cybersecurity, an industry with around 3.5 million unfilled jobs, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.

If you’re game for cybersecurity and looking to beef up your own resume, then consider the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera, which is recommended by the editors at Cybercrime Magazine. There are other online classes where you can learn basic (ethical) hacking skills for as little as $35.
