Great saving on the 1TB model with heatsink, as it drops to $100

This is one of the best SSDs that you can buy right now. Not only are you getting a proven track record and reliability that comes with the Samsung name, but this M.2 SSD offers excellent performance for a Gen 4 drive that sits above most in its class.
