In a world where deepfake scams and misinformation are increasingly pervasive, McAfee is taking a bold step forward with major enhancements to its AI-powered deepfake detection technology. By partnering with AMD and harnessing the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) within the latest AMD Ryzen![™](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png) AI 300 Series processors announced at CES, McAfee Deepfake Detector is designed to empower users to discern truth from fiction like never before. 

## Deepfakes: A Growing Global Concern 

As deepfake technology becomes more sophisticated, so too does the challenge of identifying manipulated content. Nearly two-thirds of people globally report rising concerns over deepfakes, emphasizing the need for tools that can accurately detect falsified content. 

To address this growing issue, McAfee introduced its cutting-edge AI technology, now supercharged through its collaboration with AMD, McAfee Deepfake Detector can deliver detection in seconds to help consumers navigate videos increasingly riddled with misinformation. 

## How McAfee’s AI Deepfake Detector Works

Cybercriminals are leveraging AI to manipulate audio and video, creating hyper-realistic deepfakes that are difficult to identify with the naked eye. McAfee’s Deepfake Detector uses advanced Convolution Neural Network models—AI tools specifically trained to identify manipulated or AI-generated audio within videos. 

## The AI Advantage

- **Dynamic Detection** – Quickly identifies suspicious content and alerts users. 
- **Local Processing** – Inference occurs locally on the device. 
- **Empowerment** – Gives users the confidence to navigate online spaces and distinguish authentic content from fake. 

This groundbreaking technology is aimed at not only enhancing online safety but also setting a new standard for AI-powered tools. 

## Powered by AMD’s NPU: Next-Level Enhanced Speed, Efficiency, and Privacy 

McAfee’s partnership with AMD takes deepfake detection to the next level. By leveraging the 50 TOPS of performance in the latest AMD Ryzen![™](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png) AI 300 Series processors, McAfee Deepfake Detector achieves lightning–fast detection of deepfakes. This collaboration announced at CES marks a significant leap forward in balancing AI performance with user privacy, giving consumers the best of both worlds: robust protection and peace of mind.  

This newest generation of AMD mobile processors represents huge leaps forward not just in compute and graphics performance but also in AI capabilities and experiences, all powered by the world’s most advanced family of processors1. McAfee Deepfake Detector leverages AMD XDNA![™](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png) 2 architecture providing up to a 5X increase in NPU power vs. the previous generation2, confirming continued AMD leadership in innovation and performance in this new category of AI PC computing. 

McAfee’s Deepfake Detector integrates effortlessly into the user’s workflow, ensuring that everyone—from professionals to casual users—can access next-level protection without technical hurdles. 

## The Future of Online Safety: Detect Deepfakes, Stay Secure

As deepfake technology evolves, McAfee Deepfake Detector is a game-changer in the fight against misinformation and scams. By combining AI-powered detection with the cutting-edge AMD Ryzen![™](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png) AI 300 Series processors and NPU technology, McAfee delivers: 

- Smarter AI detection of manipulated deepfake videos
- Faster, power-efficient local processing
- Cutting-edge security features to inform users on what’s real and what’s fake

 Stay one step ahead of deepfake threats. Whether you’re a professional, a consumer, or simply navigating the digital world, McAfee empowers you to discern truth from fiction—designed for a safer, more secure online experience.
