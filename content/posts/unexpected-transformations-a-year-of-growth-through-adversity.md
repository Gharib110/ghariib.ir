_This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Retroâ€™ing and Debugging 2024._

A ruptured tendon in my dominant hand just before Christmas 2023 didn't just derail my coding - it catalyzed an unexpected transformation in my career. Within weeks, I found myself thrust from being 'just another dev' into leading a team of six junior developers, compressing what should have been a gradual transition into a sudden leap.

## The Crucible of Leadership

The transition from developer to team leader brought countless sleepless nights and moments of self-doubt. What started as a physical limitation became the catalyst for profound professional growth. The most striking challenge wasn't the injury itself, but bridging a 30-year age gap with our youngest team member. Through persistent communication and a commitment to mutual learning, we've cultivated an environment where experience and fresh perspectives complement each other beautifully.

What began as uncertainty has evolved into a distinctive leadership style, shaped by both successes and setbacks. Our team has developed a culture where questions are encouraged, innovation is celebrated, and growth is constant. The age difference that initially seemed daunting has become one of our greatest strengths, combining decades of industry knowledge with fresh, contemporary approaches to problem-solving.

## Technical Evolution Against the Odds

Despite the physical limitations, my commitment to hands-on development remained strong. Logging 707 hours of coding time - averaging over two hours daily with just one functional hand - proved that adaptation trumps limitation. This dedication helped maintain credibility with the team while demonstrating that obstacles can become opportunities for innovation.

Under our collective leadership, we successfully launched eight new sites, with most beating their deadlines. More significantly, we revolutionized our approach to quality by implementing comprehensive SonarQube testing and establishing strict accessibility standards. Every project now launches with WCAG 2.0 AA compliance as a minimum requirement, not an afterthought.

## The Project That Changed Everything

One particular project became a crucible for growth, though not in the way we expected. A perfect storm of challenges - my injury, an expansive scope, a demanding client, and scope creep - resulted in a five-month delay. While it marked the most challenging period of my career, it also sparked crucial improvements in our processes.

Instead of deflecting responsibility onto my team, I shouldered the accountability for our setbacks. This decision, though difficult, strengthened team trust and demonstrated the importance of leadership through adversity. The support from upper management during this period revealed that vulnerability in leadership isn't weakness - it's an opportunity for organizational growth.

## Documentation Renaissance

Moving beyond tribal knowledge became a top priority. We've transformed our documentation from the informal "ask Keith" approach to comprehensive, accessible resources. This shift not only improved our efficiency but created a foundation for sustainable team growth and knowledge sharing.

## Creative Renaissance

Amidst the professional turbulence, an unexpected creative awakening emerged. What began as a simple website redesign project blossomed into a profound artistic journey. A modest six-paragraph story expanded into a 50,000-word narrative, launching me into an unexpected parallel career as a writer. Three additional stories now simmer in development, each offering a different refuge from the demands of technical leadership.

This creative outlet has become more than just an escape - it's a complementary force that enhances my technical leadership. The storytelling skills have improved my ability to communicate technical concepts, while the creative problem-solving strengthens my approach to coding challenges.

## Looking Forward

The year's experiences have shaped a clearer vision for the future. We're continuing to refine our project management practices and documentation standards while exploring new ways to leverage our team's diverse perspectives. The creative writing projects are evolving alongside our technical achievements, creating a satisfying balance between logical and artistic pursuits.

## A Note of Gratitude

My team's resilience during our challenging projects, their enthusiasm for learning, and their willingness to embrace change have been invaluable. Specific mentors - especially those who guided me through the leadership transition - have profoundly influenced my growth. Their support transformed what could have been a career setback into a launching pad for new opportunities.  
As we move into 2025, these experiences have equipped us with stronger processes, clearer communication, and a more cohesive team culture. What started as an injury-induced career pivot has evolved into a journey of unexpected discovery and growth.
