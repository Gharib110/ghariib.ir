Good news for growing businesses and folks with data-intensive applications: we’re excited to introduce 100% larger storage plans for both Managed MySQL and PostgreSQL in select regions. Starting today, Managed MySQL storage has doubled to 20TB, and Managed PostgreSQL now supports up to 30TB, up from 15TB. These expanded storage options are available in Singapore (SGP1), San Francisco (SFO2), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with plans to roll out to more regions later this year.

Now users have even more flexibility to scale seamlessly, whether growing existing workloads or migrating from self-managed databases. With DigitalOcean’s fully managed service, you get the performance, security, and simplicity you need—without the operational burden. Scaling your databases is now easier than ever, helping to ensure your infrastructure keeps pace with your business growth.

# Why larger plan sizes matter

As your businesses grow, so do data storage requirements. Our expanded, scalable storage options allow you to:

- **Big databases, no worries:** Support large databases with up to **20TB** and **30TB** of scalable storage.
    
- **Control both performance and costs:** Scale storage independently of CPU and memory, giving you the flexibility to adapt as your workload evolves. This ensures you pay only for what you need while avoiding over- or under-provisioning resources.
    
- **Migrate like magic:** Move from self-managed databases on Droplets or other cloud providers to **DigitalOcean Managed Databases** without storage constraints.
    

# Who benefits from this update?

Every business and every developer managing large-scale applications, analytics platforms, e-commerce sites, and any other workload requiring lots of storage capacity. Whether you’re already using managed databases and need to scale beyond **10TB for MySQL or 15TB for PostgreSQL**, or you’re new to DigitalOcean and looking for a **simpler, fully managed alternative**, this enhancement ensures we can support your growing data needs.

# Determining which database engine is right for your workload

PostgreSQL: An open-source, object-relational database built with a focus on extensibility, data integrity, and speed. PostgreSQL is optimized for concurrent transactions and read-write operations, making it ideal for complex, data-intensive use cases.

Best use cases:

- Web (SaaS) apps: PostgreSQL’s extensibility helps to ensure reliable backend support for complex web apps.
    
- AI applications: With pgvector support, PostgreSQL is well-suited for AI tasks that require fast similarity searches and handling vector data.
    
- Data analytics: Advanced query capabilities and support for complex data types make PostgreSQL a strong choice for analytics apps.
    

MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system with an incredibly flexible and powerful program that is used to store and retrieve data for a wide variety of applications. MySQL performs reliably in high-traffic, read-focused environments.

Best use cases:

- E-commerce apps: MySQL’s reliability and wide adoption make it ideal for e-commerce apps that need consistent, high-speed data functionalities.
    
- High-traffic web apps: The scalability, reliability, high performance that MySQL offers is optimal for handling significant user loads.
    
- Content-driven websites: MySQL’s read optimization makes it ideal for high-traffic sites focused on fast data retrieval, such as news sites, blogs, and CMS platforms.
