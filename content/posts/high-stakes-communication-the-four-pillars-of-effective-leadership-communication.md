You’ve been there before: standing in front of your team, announcing a major technological transformation that you know is crucial for the company’s future. Despite your careful preparation, you can see it in their eyes—skepticism, confusion, or worse, quiet resignation. The change you’re proposing may be exactly what the organization needs, but your message isn’t quite landing the way you hoped.

This scenario plays out in enterprise technology organizations every day, and it’s exactly what Paul Gaffney, former technology executive at Home Depot and Dick’s Sporting Goods, addressed in his powerful talk at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit 2024. After decades of driving major technological transformations, Gaffney has discovered that the difference between a change initiative’s success and failure often comes down to one critical skill: the ability to communicate in a way that truly enlists people in your vision.

“Your goal in high-stakes communication is to get people to understand what you’re asking them to do and then have their hearts and minds wedded to doing it,” Gaffney explained. But how do you achieve this level of buy-in when the stakes are high and the changes are complex? Drawing from 25 years of refined communication practice, Gaffney has developed a framework that specifically addresses the challenges technology leaders face when driving significant organizational change.

## The Four Pillars of Effective Leadership Communication

### 1) Clarity

The first component, clarity, might seem straightforward but often falls victim to common leadership pitfalls. Gaffney illustrated this with a pointed example: announcing “we’re going to launch an agile transformation” isn’t clarity—it’s an invitation for misinterpretation. During his tenure at Home Depot, instead of using buzzy terminology, he opted for crystal-clear messaging: “We are going to get better results by shipping smaller pieces of software faster and getting feedback from our real end users and adjusting.”

### 2) Depth

The second component, depth, proves more challenging but equally crucial. It’s about demonstrating genuine expertise and understanding of the subject matter. Gaffney referenced Ray Dalio’s concept of “believability” from Bridgewater Associates—the idea that your audience needs to trust that you’ve successfully navigated similar challenges before. He also drew inspiration from Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” noting how King established credibility by demonstrating deep knowledge of philosophy and religion, even while writing from a jail cell with limited resources.

### 3) Care

The third component, initially labeled as empathy but later refined to “care,” draws from ethicist Nell Noddings’ work on caring relationships. This aspect involves acknowledging the human impact of organizational changes and showing genuine concern for those affected. Gaffney used the metaphor of the Fisher King from Arthurian legend—leaders must be willing to ask, “What ails you?” and truly listen to the answer before expecting their teams to embark on transformative journeys.

### 4) Responsibility

The fourth component, responsibility, requires leaders to provide a broader context for their initiatives. This might include insights about stakeholder commitments, regulatory pressures, or strategic shifts that team members might not otherwise be aware of. This context helps people understand why changes are necessary and how their efforts contribute to larger organizational goals.

## Connecting with Diverse Motivations

Gaffney emphasized that these components become increasingly important as the stakes rise. He identified five primary drivers in the workplace:

- Customer service

- Company success

- Personal advancement

- Team affiliation

- Societal impact

“When I’m lazy, which is the default condition, those are the only motivations I address in my communication,” he admitted, referring to his own bias toward customer and company-focused messaging. “When I force myself to do the work, I step back and say, I have to speak to the other three motivations as well.”

## Getting Started with the Four Pillars: A Practical Guide

### 1\. Achieving True Clarity in Messaging

When crafting your next important message, start by eliminating abstract terminology and buzzwords. Break down exactly what you want your team to do differently tomorrow.

To test your message’s clarity:

- Ask yourself: “Could someone take immediate action based on this message?”

- Share it with a trusted colleague who’s known for asking tough questions

- Check if different team members interpret it the same way

- Remove any industry jargon that isn’t absolutely necessary

### 2\. Demonstrating Deep Understanding

Before important communications, be prepared to:

- Share specific examples of where similar approaches succeeded (and failed)

- Discuss the technical challenges your team might encounter

- Reference relevant data and metrics from past experiences

- Acknowledge and address known obstacles upfront

### 3\. Showing Authentic Care for Teams

Before rolling out any significant change, schedule one-on-one conversations with team members who will be most affected. Ask three key questions:

- “How do you think this change might impact your daily work?”

- “What concerns you most about this initiative?”

- “What support would you need to make this successful?”

Then, when communicating the change more broadly, explicitly address the concerns you’ve heard and outline how you’ll support the team through the transition.

### 4\. Understanding Leadership Responsibility

When communicating any significant change:

- Start with the external factors driving the need for change (market conditions, customer needs, competitive pressures)

- Explain any relevant board or stakeholder commitments

- Share insights about industry trends that may not be visible to your teams

- Draw clear lines between individual efforts and company-wide objectives

## Putting It All Together: A Communication Template

When preparing your next high-stakes message, use this structure:

1. Clear Statement of Change: “We are going to \[specific action\] to achieve \[specific outcome\]”

3. Demonstration of Understanding: “I’ve seen this work at \[example\], and here’s what we learned…”

5. Acknowledgment of Impact: “I understand this will require \[specific changes\] from many of you…”

7. Broader Context: “This initiative is crucial because \[external factors\] and will help us \[strategic objective\]”

For enterprise technology leaders navigating complex transformations, Gaffney’s framework offers a structured approach to ensure their messages not only inform but truly engage and motivate their teams. In an era where technology changes rapidly but human nature remains constant, mastering these communication principles could be the difference between a change initiative’s success or failure.
