JetBrains Marketplace is introducing changes to how continuity discounts are handled for paid plugins, giving plugin authors more flexibility in managing their pricing strategies. Here’s everything you need to know about the new option to cancel the continuity discount and how it affects your plugins.

## **What is the continuity discount?**

The continuity discount is a pricing benefit that offers customers a reduced rate when renewing their licenses. This discount has been a key feature for paid plugins, helping to incentivize long-term renewals. However, authors now have more control over whether to continue offering this discount.

## **Canceling the continuity discount**

You now have the option to cancel the continuity discount for your plugin directly from the _Sales_ tab in the plugin settings.

Here’s how it works:

- **Set a cancellation date**: You can specify the date when the continuity discount will no longer apply to both personal and commercial licenses.

- **Irreversible action**: Once the discount is canceled, it cannot be reinstated.

- **Impact on customers**: The cancellation will not trigger automatic notifications to your current customers. If you want to inform them, we can assist you with communication.

- **Grandfathered licenses**: The discount will continue to apply to licenses purchased before the cancellation date.

## **Default settings for new plugins**

For newly published plugins, the continuity discount will now be switched off by default. There will no longer be the option to enable it for these plugins. 

However, customers with active subscriptions for existing plugins will still benefit from the discount.
