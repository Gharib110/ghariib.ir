At Mozilla, browser security is a critical mission, and part of that mission involves responding swiftly to new threats. Tuesday, around 8 AM Eastern time, we received a heads-up from the Anti-Virus company ESET, who alerted us to a Firefox exploit that had been spotted in the wild. We want to give a huge thank you to ESET for sharing their findings with us—it’s collaboration like this that keeps the web a safer place for everyone.

We’ve already released a fix for this particular issue, so when Firefox prompts you to upgrade, click that button. If you don’t know about Session Restore, you can ask Firefox to restore your previous session on restart.

The sample ESET sent us contained a full exploit chain that allowed remote code execution on a user’s computer. Within an hour of receiving the sample, we had convened a team of security, browser, compiler, and platform engineers to reverse engineer the exploit, force it to trigger its payload, and understand how it worked.

During exploit contests such as pwn2own, we know ahead of time when we will receive an exploit, can convene the team ahead of time, and receive a detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities and exploit. At pwn2own 2024, we shipped a fix in 21 hours, something that helped us earn an industry award for fastest to patch. This time, with no notice and some heavy reverse engineering required, we were able to ship a fix in **25 hours**. (And we’re continually examining the process to help us drive that down further.)

While we take pride in how quickly we respond to these threats, it’s only part of the process. While we have resolved the vulnerability in Firefox, our team will continue to analyze the exploit to find additional hardening measures to make deploying exploits for Firefox harder and rarer. It’s also important to keep in mind that these kinds of exploits aren’t unique to Firefox. Every browser (and operating system) faces security challenges from time to time. That’s why keeping your software up to date is crucial across the board.

As always, we’ll keep doing what we do best—strengthening Firefox’s security and improving its defenses.
