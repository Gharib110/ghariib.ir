The debate over in-office versus remote work misses a fundamental truth: high-performing teams succeed based on how they’re organized, not where they sit. Through extensive research across industries, Gene Kim and Dr. Steven J. Spear found that three key mechanisms consistently enable team excellence: slowing down to speed up, breaking down complexity, and amplifying problems early.

As they explain in their award-winning book _Wiring the Winning Organization_, the leaders of the highest-performing teams will use these three simple mechanisms to “wire their organization for success instead of mediocrity.” 

## 1\. Slow Down to Speed Up

High-performing teams in 2025 must prioritize solving problems in controlled environments before they appear in production, what Kim and Spear term “slowification.” High-performing teams should look to:

- Move complex problem-solving offline instead of firefighting during execution.

- Create dedicated spaces for experimentation and learning.

- Build standard approaches based on validated solutions.

- Test new processes in low-stakes environments.

Toyota exemplifies this approach using careful preparation and practice to achieve industry-leading performance. Known as the Toyota Production System, this method of slowing down to solve problems has long been proven to help the highest-performing teams succeed. And it will continue to be a differentiator for high-performing teams in 2025 and beyond.

## 2\. Break Down Complexity 

High-performing organizations like Amazon have transformed their performance by making complex work manageable through what Kim and Spear term “simplification.”

Simplification is the process of making complex work more manageable by:

- Creating small, self-contained teams that own complete workflows.

- Defining clear handoffs between specialized functions.

- Implementing changes incrementally rather than all at once.

- Designing linear processes with obvious next steps.

Amazon has used these principles to evolve from making only twenty software deployments per year to over 136,000 daily deployments. They achieved this by breaking down monolithic systems into smaller, independent services with clear interfaces.

## 3\. Amplify Problems Early

Drawing from their research of high-performing organizations in manufacturing, healthcare, and technology, Kim and Spear found that great organizations create mechanisms to detect and respond to small issues before they become major disruptions. This “amplification,” as they call it, requires teams to maintain reserve capacity to swarm problems when they occur and share solutions across teams to prevent recurrence down the road.

In other words, high-performing teams:

- Make problems visible immediately when they occur.

- Create rapid feedback loops between dependent teams.

- Maintain reserve capacity to swarm and contain issues.

- Share solutions across teams to prevent recurrence.

## Leading the High-Performing Team

To create and lead your high-performing teams, Kim and Spear recommend starting with what they call a “model line”—a small segment where new approaches can be tested. Their research shows three phases of implementing a model line in any organization:

1. **Start Small:** Choose one critical workflow, form an initial cross-functional team, and implement basic performance metrics.

3. **Expand Thoughtfully**: Add supporting capabilities, establish clear team interactions, and build knowledge-sharing mechanisms.

5. **Optimize Continuously**: Refine team boundaries and interfaces while maintaining focus on outcomes.

The organizations that thrive in 2025 and beyond will be those that create what Kim and Spear call effective “social circuitry”—the processes and norms that enable great collaboration. When teams have well-defined boundaries, clear visibility into work, and mechanisms to coordinate when needed, location becomes irrelevant.

The future belongs to organizations that focus on creating the right conditions for teams to excel, whether in a physical, remote, or hybrid environment. By implementing the three key mechanisms of great social circuitry, leaders can build high-performing teams that consistently deliver exceptional results, regardless of where they sit. 

The evidence presented in _Wiring the Winning Organization_ makes this clear: excellence comes from organizational design, not office design.
