Hi everybody,

We all know how critical web accessibility is for creating inclusive digital experiences. But letâ€™s face it - integrating accessibility fixes can sometimes feel like a challenge.

Weâ€™re conducting a quick **3-minute survey** (**all closed-ended questions**) to understand how you and your companies handle web accessibility fixes. Whether youâ€™re a fan of overlays, prefer direct source-code changes, or use a mix of both, your input will help us design tools that fit seamlessly into your workflows.

Why this matters:  
Your feedback will directly shape accessibility tools that:

- Align with real-world developer workflows.
- Address the most common pain points.
- Make the web more inclusive for everyone.

ðŸ‘‰ \[Take the Survey Here\] ðŸ‘ˆ

Thank you for helping us make web accessibility simpler and more developer-friendly!

If you have thoughts to share beyond the survey, Iâ€™d love to hear them in the comments below. ðŸ˜Š
