Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 28, 2025

In our hyper-connected world, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. With increasing reliance on digital technologies, individuals and organizations face a growing array of cyber threats, ranging from data breaches to ransomware attacks.

Cybercrime is projected to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.

Understanding cybersecurity and implementing effective strategies is essential to safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring online safety, but it’s far easier for large organizations who employ full time security professionals.

A short easy-to-read guide for small businesses and consumers (who are all too often under-protected) explores the fundamentals of cybersecurity and emerging threats, and provides bulleted resources with tips for best practices and links to third party resources.

The handy reference guide published by DEV, a community of 2.7 million software developers, is a good starting point for defending against phishing attacks that are headed your way in 2025.
