Job Posting: **PhD Position**  
_CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security_

We are looking for a motivated PhD student to contribute to research in public-key cryptography and provable security.  
  
We explore topics including, but not limited to:

- Key exchange and secure messaging
- Public-key encryption with advanced functionalities

Our research typically includes the following aspects:

- Formalizing new cryptographic primitives and security models
- Modularizing complex primitives
- Developing techniques to achieve concrete (and tight) security bounds
- Designing and analyzing practical instantiations (e.g., based on elliptic curves, lattices, or isogenies)
