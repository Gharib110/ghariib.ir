You know, it’s a tale as old as custom mechanical keyboards. \[penkia\] couldn’t find any PCBs with 36 keys and Gateron low-profile switch footprints, so they made their own and called it the LoremIpsum36. Isn’t it lovely?

![Close-up of the RP2040 sitting flush as can be in the PCB.](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lorem-ipsum-inner.jpg?w=400)This baby runs on an RP2040, which sits flush as can be in a cutout in the PCB. This maneuver, along with the LP switches in hard-to-find SK-33 sockets results in quite the thin board.

\[penkia\] says that despite using a 3 mm tray for added rigidity, the entire thing is thinner than the Nuphy Air60 v2, which is just over half an inch (13.9 mm) thick. For keycaps, \[penkia\] has used both XVX profile and FKcaps’ LPF.

And yeah, that area in the middle is crying out for _something_; maybe a trackball or something similar. But \[penkia\] is satisfied with it as-is for the first version, so we are, too.

Do you like 36-key boards, but prefer curves? Check out the Lapa keyboard, which doubles as a mouse.
