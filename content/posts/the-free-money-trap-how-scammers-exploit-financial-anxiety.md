With financial stress at an all-time high, and many Americans grappling with confusion about social security, Medicaid, and Medicare, people are desperately seeking relief. Scammers know this all too well and have tailored their tactics to exploit these fears, preying on vulnerable individuals with promises of “free money.”

Whether it’s a so-called “subsidy program,” a “government grant,” or a “relief card,” these scams all share the same underlying goal—to manipulate people into giving away their personal information, or—worse—their hard-earned cash.

## Common free money scams

### **Too-good-to-be-true claims**:

- “Get a $6,400 Subsidy to Pay for Groceries, Rent, and Gas!” 

- “Only 3 Days Left to Claim Your Government Benefit!” 

- “482 Spots Remaining! Act Now!” 

Urgency and exclusivity are classic scam tactics. By creating a demand to do something as soon as possible, scammers push people to act before they have time to think critically. 

### **Fabricated** **s****ocial** **p****roof** 

- “Floyd Miles from LA just received his subsidy!” 

- “Mary T. Pritts from Silsbee, TX qualified 17 seconds ago!” 

- “Thousands of Americans are getting financial relief!” 

These so called testimonials are almost always fake, designed to create a false sense of trust. The names, locations, and stories are either entirely made up or copied from other scam sites. 

### **A push to submit personal information** 

- “Enter your name, email, and phone number to check eligibility!” 

- “Claim your subsidy now – just provide your bank details!” 

The goal? To collect personal data that can be used for identity theft, sold to third parties, or leveraged for future scams. 

### **Push notification scams** 

After submitting information, users are prompted to “Allow” notifications to receive updates on their application. In reality, enabling notifications results in a flood of unwanted ads and malicious content (malvertising), potentially exposing users to phishing attempts and harmful software. 

## **Additional social engineering techniques**

- **Phishing emails and messages**: Scammers send convincing emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate government agencies or financial institutions, urging users to click on malicious links or provide personal information. 

- **Impersonation scams**: Fraudsters pose as government officials, representatives from relief organizations, or financial advisors to gain victims’ trust. 

- **Fake customer support calls**: Victims may receive calls from so-called “support agents” asking for verification details to process their subsidy claim. 

- **QR code scams**: Increasingly, scammers use QR codes on fake subsidy pages to drive users to phishing sites that steal their credentials.

- **Malware-infested attachments**: Scammers send downloadable forms for “subsidy applications,” which are actually embedded with malware that steals information from users’ devices. 

## **Red flags to watch out for** 

- **Vague or unverifiable claims:** Legitimate government programs are clearly outlined on official websites (.gov domains). If a subsidy isn’t listed there, it doesn’t exist.

- **No contact information:** If a website lacks a verifiable phone number, email or office address, it’s likely a scam. 

- **Unrealistic promises:** Any offer of free money with no strings attached should raise suspicions. 

- **Pressuring users to act quickly:** Government aid programs don’t work on a first-come, first-served basis with countdown timers. 

## **How to protect yourself** from free money scams

- **Verify sources**: If an offer sounds too good to be true, check with official government sites like USA.gov or your local state agency. 

- **Never share personal information**: Avoid entering sensitive information (Social Security Number, bank details, etc.) on unverified websites. 

- **Report suspicious sites**: If you come across a scam, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. 

- **Educate others**: Many scam victims are elderly or financially struggling individuals who may not recognize these red flags. Share this knowledge to protect your loved ones. 

## **Conclusion** 

Scammers are constantly evolving, but their tactics remain predictable. By staying informed and skeptical of “too-good-to-be-true” offers, we can collectively shut down these fraudulent schemes. The best defense is awareness—because in reality, there’s no such thing as free money.
