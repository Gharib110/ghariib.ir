# Between Two Nerds NSAs 9 to 5 hacking campaign

<br/>

<br/>
In this edition of Between Two Nerds Tom Uren and The Grugq take a deep dive into incident response reports from Chinese cybersecurity firms that attribute the hack of one of the countryâ€™s top seven defence universities to the US National Security Agency. These reports were collated and translated into English by the security researcher known as Inversecos (https://x.com/inversecos).
