**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-11613  
**Published :** Jan. 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 35 minutes ago  
**Description :** The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution, Arbitrary File Read, and Arbitrary File Deletion in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.15 via the 'wfu\_file\_downloader.php' file. This is due to lack of proper sanitization of the 'source' parameter and allowing a user-defined directory path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.  
**Severity:** 9.8 | CRITICAL
