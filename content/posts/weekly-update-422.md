Apparently, Stefan and I trying to work stuff out in real time about how to build more efficient features in HIBP is entertaining watching! If I was to guess, I think it's just seeing people work through the logic of how things work and how we might be able to approach things differently, and doing it in real time very candidly. I'm totally happy doing that, and the comments from the audience did give us more good food for thought too. I'll try and line up a session just like that before the end of the year, we've certainly got no shortage of material!
