![300,000+ Prometheus Servers and Exporters Exposed to DoS Attacks](https://blog.aquasec.com/hubfs/Prometheus-blog-main-image-text.jpg)

In this research, we uncovered several vulnerabilities and security flaws within the Prometheus ecosystem. These findings span across three major areas: information disclosure, denial-of-service (DoS), and code execution.  We found that exposed Prometheus servers or exporters, often lacking proper authentication, allowed attackers to easily gather sensitive information, such as credentials and API keys.
