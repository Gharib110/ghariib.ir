# Srsly Risky Biz EU lobs software liability hand grenade

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren, Patrick Gray and Adam Boileau talk about an EU directive that will make vendors liable for software defects. The directive sets a very high bar but is also limited in scope. It only applies to individuals and doesnâ€™t cover professional use so it is a very practical way to start changing expectations about liability.

They also talk about Session Messenger app which has decamped from Australia and set up a foundation in Switzerland. The encrypted and metadata-resistant app is catnip for criminals, so we expect that it is on a collision course with state power.

This episode is also available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/DCD1WJv-e58).
