# Introduction:

The smooth functioning of Microsoft Outlook depends on the health of its data file formats—OST and PST. Both the files store the mailbox data like email messages, contacts, calendars, etc. locally on the system. OST, or offline storage table files, are encrypted with a MAPIEntryID GUID key and are linked with a particular profile. It means accessing this file requires authentication from the linked MAPI profile. In contrast, the PST (Personal Storage Table) file is portable, or transferrable, and can be accessed easily through a different Outlook profile. This portable nature makes PST files more prone to corruption or damage. 

Many factors are responsible for corruption in the Outlook data file (.pst). Such factors comprise issues with hardware or software, an oversized mailbox, a malware attack, etc. Since PST files store crucial data, we need to repair it at the earliest. To fix corruption and errors in Outlook data file (.pst), Microsoft has provided a built-in utility called Inbox Repair Tool, or ScanPST.exe. However, this tool has some drawbacks. Firstly, it is a time-consuming, manual exercise that requires a degree of technical knowledge. Secondly, it may fail to repair a large PST file. Thirdly, it may not be able to repair a PST file that is severely damaged by a virus or malware attack. Sometimes, ScanPST may delete irreparable items, leading to partial data loss.

We can employ any PST Repair Software to fix PST files and get around the limitations of ScanPST.exe. Such tools offer quick repair solutions. These software options also feature options like choosing specific items to recover, previewing recoverable items, etc. Selecting the right tool for PST repair is a bit challenging because there are many options available. In this post, we will explore the top 5 PST repair software for Outlook. You can evaluate the pros and cons of each software and pick the best one for your needs.
