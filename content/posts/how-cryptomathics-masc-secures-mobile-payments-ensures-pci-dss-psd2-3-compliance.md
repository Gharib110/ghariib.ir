With the increasing adoption of mobile banking and payment apps, financial institutions face greater challenges in securing cardholder data. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) outlines stringent requirements to protect payment card data, ensuring that institutions maintain trust and security in their mobile ecosystems. Additionally, the European Payment Services Directives (PSD2 and the upcoming PSD3) introduce mandates like Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to further enhance security in electronic payments.
