The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries like healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and even autonomous vehicles—making our daily lives hyperconnected. But as more devices come online, relying solely on cloud computing can lead to slow response times, high bandwidth costs and security risks. The traditional cloud-based infrastructure struggles to keep up with the demands of real-time data processing, low latency, and proactive, preventative security. Before we dive in, let me explain what is edge computing is about and how it applies to IoT. Simply put, edge computing processes data right where it’s generated instead of routing it to remote \[…\]
