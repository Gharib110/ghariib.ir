Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 9, 2025

Every year brings new challenges — more threats, new techniques, more astute perpetrators, according to Rob Gurzeev, co-founder and CEO at CyCognito, a Forbes tech council member, and former CTO, Intelligence Division at Unit 8200, an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

The stakes will get bigger and bigger—cybercrime costs are projected by Cybersecurity Ventures to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015. This surge represents the largest economic transfer in history, surpassing even the global trade of illegal drugs.

Gurzeev believes that the key to getting ahead of these challenges is understanding what’s ahead and preparing for the worst. In a Security Boulevard article he writes that attackers will use advanced AI-driven reconnaissance techniques to exploit security gaps faster and at a greater scale than ever before.
