Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 23, 2025

According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are expected to reach $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. This represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history and is exponentially larger than the damage inflicted from natural disasters in a year.

If it were measured as a country, cybercrime would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China and will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined.

Digital Risk, Inc. consulted with CISOs, journalists, and threat researchers in order to compile a list of 10 top cybersecurity predictions for 2025. Taken together, this thought leadership is a solid starting point in our annual war on cybercrime.

“While the ultimate goal of making money hasn’t changed, how attacks are conducted to get that money is evolving at a rapid pace,” says Daniel Blackford, Head of Threat Research at Proofpoint. “The steps and methods cybercriminals employ to entice a victim to download malware or issue a payment to a bogus “supplier” now involve more advanced and complex tactics and techniques in their attack chain.”
