- **Proactive Threat Defense for Financial Institutions**: Trustwave's DbProtect actively identifies sensitive data locations and analyzes potential threat vectors, enabling immediate security measures like enhanced access controls and vulnerability prioritization.
- **Advanced Offensive Security Measures**: Trustwave's offensive security services, including penetration testing and Red Team exercises, simulate real-world cyber threats to expose weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.
- **Comprehensive Security Beyond Databases**: Trustwave complements database security with solutions like MailMarshal for phishing protection, user awareness training, and compliance support to safeguard financial institutions from evolving cyber threats.

Financial institutions are robbed in innumerable ways. Gunmen conduct physical attacks on bank branches; people commit credit card fraud; hackers attempt to break into ATMs and force them to spit out thousands of dollars, while other threat actors seek to bypass these small-scale incidents and go for millions via a cyberattack.
