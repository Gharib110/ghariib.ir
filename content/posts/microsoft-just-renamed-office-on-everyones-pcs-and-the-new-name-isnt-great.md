The productivity suite is now out of Office.

Back in December, Microsoft gave out a small warning. It stated that it planned to rebrand its entire productivity line from "Microsoft 365 Office" to "Microsoft 365 Copilot," and people didn't really gel with the idea. Well, seems Microsoft didn't really care, as it has given the green light to begin rebranding everyone's apps to a more Copilot-focused brand.
