**Day 1**

Dear Reader,

I don't want to overcomplicate our relationship here, I feel like sharing a journey and you're free to join me on that journey-would certainly make me feel less alone on this informal path of life.  
My name is Israa, I'm currently 26 and I live in Cairo, Egypt. I never thought I would be here right now, I'm very grateful for the magical path I'm on. One thing I would like to tell you about myself is my river of curiosity which I am merely a passenger on. I like to trust myself enough to know that I'm ending somewhere well.  
What path am I on, you ask? Well, there's something calling me towards tech in general, perhaps towards development and engineering. I still have no idea but there's nothing wrong in figuring it out as you go. So far I learnt the difference between a front-end and back-end development. I'll come back tomorrow with more updates.

Yours,  
Israa.
