Don't let dust and other particles beat you and your mighty system.

Dust is your PC's worst nightmare. It infiltrates the chassis, lands on a component, and starts to accumulate over time. Too much dust can create a layer of insulation, causing the hardware to run hotter than usual. Clogging up fans could result in less air being forced through vents and the performance of everything inside your PC will be compromised. Luckily, keeping dust outside your PC, or at least keeping on top of the stuff that makes it inside your system, is easier than you may think.
