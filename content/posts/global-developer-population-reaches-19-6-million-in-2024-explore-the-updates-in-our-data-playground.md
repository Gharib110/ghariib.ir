A year ago, we launched the **Developer Ecosystem: Data Playground**, an interactive dashboard offering insights into the global developer landscape. Today, we’re excited to introduce a significant update that enhances the dashboard with refined data, salary ranges, and even more granular insights into developer demographics and market trends.

## What’s New?

To make it easier to explore and analyze different aspects of the developer landscape, we have now separated the IT Salary Calculator from the Data Playground dashboard. This will allow users to focus specifically on salary insights or dive deeper into developer population estimates without overlap:

- The **IT Salary Calculator** now stands on its own, allowing users to focus exclusively on salary trends. Our calculator provides clear salary ranges tailored by country, programming language, and total experience level.

- The **Data Playground** has been refined with a new methodology and 2024 data for deeper insights. This dashboard offers an in-depth view of global and regional developer populations, distributions across age groups and experience levels, and the prevalence of various programming languages, OSs, technologies, and more.

> “This separation ensures a more streamlined experience and makes it easier to find the exact insights you need.”

## How Many Developers Are There in the World? _2024 Update_

Using our 2023 methodology, we estimated approximately 13.4 million professional developers worldwide. For 2024, our revised model puts the number closer to **19.6** **million professional developers** globally — a **major increase driven by key updates to our methodology.** To ensure accuracy, we have also revised historical estimates, aligning past data with our refined model.

### Why Did the Numbers Change?

1. **Improved Data Sources**

We’ve integrated new data from international labor organizations and the latest data from our 2024 Developer Ecosystem Survey, ensuring our estimates reflect the most up-to-date trends.

2. **Refined Methodology**

Our model now better accounts for regional specifics and countries where developer growth has been accelerating. The five fastest-growing developer populations between 2019 and 2024 are:

- **India** now accounts for **14% year-over-year growth** in its developer workforce, driven by its booming IT sector.

- **The United States** and **China** continue to dominate in total numbers of professional developers. 

3. **Expanded Definition of Professional Developers**

While we continue to focus on **professional developers**, we’ve refined our categories to include roles like **Software Quality Assurance Analysts, Testers, and Data Scientists.** These professions were previously grouped into broader categories that also included many non-coding specialists. With these roles now explicitly categorized in labor statistics, our estimates provide a more accurate picture of the developer workforce.

> “Our Data Science team worked on updating the model to incorporate fresh labor statistics and better reflect the rapid growth of the ICT sector. We also focused on including more coding professions in estimation, such as Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Data Scientists, to ensure our estimates align more closely with the realities of the evolving developer landscape.”

## IT Salary Calculator: Now with Ranges

The **IT Salary Calculator** has been significantly enhanced to provide users with more accurate and actionable insights. The tool now offers salary ranges segmented by country, programming language, and total experience level, making it invaluable for job seekers, employers, and industry analysts.

> “The salary data still comes from the Developer Ecosystem Survey but is now more precise. This year, respondents provided exact incomes (e.g., $4,200 monthly) instead of selecting from ranges (e.g., $4,000-$5,000). Additionally, we now display gross annual income – before taxes and including bonuses – for better comparability with other salary sources.”
