Hello everyone! I’m new here and looking for some feedback on a thought I’ve had recently. I’ve been exploring the cryptocurrency market and came across an interesting trend: memecoins. A while ago, a Brazilian adult content creator launched a memecoin called 'bct' (short for 'pussy' in Portuguese), and she made a significant profit from it. This got me thinking: what if other adult content creators started their own memecoins? With the rise of online content creation as a career, these creators have massive influence, and it seems like an untapped niche in the crypto world. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this—could this be a viable new market for creators?
