_**CTO Wanted: Build the Future of Proof of compute Decentralized Cloud Computing!**_

Who We Are

We are a startup on a mission to disrupt Cryto, AWS & Google Cloud with a decentralized, open-source cloud platform powered by Proof of Compute (PoC) instead of Proof of Work. Our vision? Turn idle computing power into a decentralized cloud where miners earn by contributing real compute resources.

What Weâ€™re Building

ðŸ”¹ A global, distributed cloud that is cheaper, faster, and censorship-resistant

ðŸ”¹ A plug-and-play GUI-based installer for miners (Linux-based)

ðŸ”¹ A token-incentivized economy for compute providers and users

ðŸ”¹ Open-source, trustless, and autonomous cloud compute allocation

What Weâ€™re Looking For

We need a Technical Co-Founder / CTO who can lead our engineering vision & execution. If you love Web3, decentralized cloud computing, and disrupting Big Tech, we want you!

Your Role & Responsibilities:

Architect & develop the Proof of Compute protocol

Lead the development of the miner software (Linux-based GUI installer)

Oversee backend infrastructure & decentralized cloud orchestration

Build a high-performance compute marketplace

Grow & lead a team of blockchain, cloud, and AI engineers

Ideal Skills & Experience

ðŸ”¹ Experience in Cloud Computing & Distributed Systems (Kubernetes, Docker, Nomad)

ðŸ”¹ Blockchain & Smart Contract Development (Solidity, Rust, Cosmos SDK)

ðŸ”¹ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking & Storage (IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, Akash)

ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning/AI Integration (Nice to have but not required)

ðŸ”¹ Passion for open-source & decentralization

Whatâ€™s in it for You?

Co-founder role & equity-based compensation

Be part of a Web3 revolution challenging AWS & Google Cloud

Full creative & technical control over the platform

Join a passionate, mission-driven team with huge upside potential

Ready to Build the Future of Compute?

If you're a visionary engineer who thrives on deep tech challenges and wants to build the next-generation decentralized cloud, weâ€™d love to chat.

Answer the following questions in your response:

How would you design a decentralized cloud platform that allows miners to contribute compute power while ensuring scalability, security, and fair resource allocation?

How would you design a Proof of Compute consensus mechanism that prevents Sybil attacks, fairly rewards miners, and ensures efficient resource allocation?

Imagine AWS or Google Cloud announces a decentralized alternative tomorrow. How would you position our platform to compete and win?
