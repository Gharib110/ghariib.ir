**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-11848  
**Published :** Jan. 15, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago  
**Description :** The NitroPack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'nitropack\_dismiss\_notice\_forever' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.17.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options to a fixed value of '1' which can activate certain options (e.g., enable user registration) or modify certain options in a way that leads to a denial of service condition.  
**Severity:** 8.1 | HIGH
