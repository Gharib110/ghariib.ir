Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce enhancements to our Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance portfolio, further empowering AWS customers to build and manage secure, compliant payment environments with greater ease and flexibility.

**PCI Data Security Standard (DSS)****:** Our latest AWS PCI DSS v4 Attestation of Compliance (AOC) is now available and includes six additional AWS services:

- Amazon Application Recovery Controller
- Amazon Q Business
- Amazon Q Developer
- Amazon Security Lake
- AWS Verified Access
- Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client

This expansion allows you to use these services while maintaining PCI DSS compliance, enabling innovation without compromising security. You can see the full list of services at AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program.

**PCI Personal Identification Number (PIN):** We updated our PCI PIN AOC for two critical services:

- AWS CloudHSM: Manage your encryption keys on FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified hardware in your own virtual private cloud (VPC), with a dedicated, single-tenant hardware security module (HSM) solution.
- AWS Payment Cryptography: Use payment HSMs that are PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS) HSM certified and fully managed by AWS, with PCI PIN and point-to-point encryption (P2PE)–compliant key management.

These refreshed attestations offer you greater flexibility in deploying regulated workloads while significantly reducing your compliance overhead. You can access the PCI DSS and PIN AOC reports through AWS Artifact. This self-service portal provides on-demand access to AWS compliance reports, streamlining your audit processes.
