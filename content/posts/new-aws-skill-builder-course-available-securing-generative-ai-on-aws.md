To support our customers in securing their generative AI workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are excited to announce the launch of a new AWS Skill Builder course: Securing Generative AI on AWS.

This comprehensive course is designed to help security professionals, architects, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) engineers understand and implement security best practices for generative AI applications and models in the AWS Cloud.

AWS Skill Builder is a learning center for AWS customers and partners to build cloud skills through digital trainings, self-paced labs, and other course types. AWS Skill Builder has a variety of AWS security content to help customers understand concepts and gain hands-on experience with AWS security.

The course highlights are as follows:

- **Introduction to the Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix** – Learn how to categorize and secure different AI implementations by using this innovative framework.
- **Coverage of key AI security frameworks** – Gain insights into the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs) and the MITRE ATLAS framework.
- **Practical security strategies** – Develop skills to implement comprehensive security across the areas of governance, legal, risk, controls, and resilience for various AI scopes.
- **Real-world applications** – Apply security concepts to case studies covering consumer applications, enterprise solutions, pre-trained models, fine-tuned models, and self-trained models.
