Job Posting: **Postdoctoral Scholar in Multi-party Computation and Quantum Cryptography**  
_Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan_

As part of the collaboration between the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and Partisia (Aarhus, Denmark), the Applied Cryptography Unit at OIST is seeking to hire a postdoctoral scholar to conduct research on applications of Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) to quantum cryptography.

The postdoc will investigate how MPC techniques may be used to enhance the security and functionality of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enabled networks. The project will be led by Prof. Carlos Cid at OIST, with close collaboration with researchers from Partisia. The ideal candidate will have experience in the design and analysis of secure computation protocols, and strong knowledge of quantum cryptography.

We are seeking candidates with excellent post-graduate academic formation in cryptography, mathematics, computer science, or a closely related field, with research strong experience in the design and analysis of secure computation, and in quantum cryptography. Candidates must have a PhD at the time of commencing the position. This is a full-time, fixed-term appointment for 2 years, potentially extended depending of performance and other circumstances.

**Starting Date:** as soon as possible.

**Closing date for applications:**

**Contact:** Carlos Cid (_carlos.cid\_\[at\]\_oist.jp_)
