Welcome to the second day of Pwn2Own Automotive 2025. Yesterday, we awarded more than $380,000 for 16 unique 0-days - and we had several bug collisions as well. Today looks to be even better, with the WOLFBOX and Tesla EV chargers making their Pwn2Own debut. Here’s how the Master of Pwn standings look at the beginning of Day Two:
