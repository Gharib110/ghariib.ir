The Early Access Program (EAP) for GoLand 2025.1 is now open! In this release cycle, we’re focusing on enhancing Go language support, improving code analysis, and boosting stability to provide a seamless development experience for all the gophers.

The first EAP build can be downloaded via the Toolbox App, from our website, or as a snap package for Ubuntu. You can also get it from inside GoLand by selecting _Check IDE updates for Early Access Program_ in _Settings | Appearance & Behavior | System Settings | Updates._

## **What’s new in GoLand 2025.1 EAP 1**

In this release, we’ve fixed the following issues:

- **GO-17728**: go list -m json all no longer runs repeatedly in the background when GOTOOLCHAIN is configured.

- **GO-16904**: Method signatures for interfaces with unexported custom types are generated correctly again.

By the way, did you know GoLand can also help you work with databases or develop for the web? These functionalities are taken from our sister products – WebStorm, DataGrip, and IntelliJ IDEA. Check out the linked EAP blog posts to learn more.

## **Further plans**

During this EAP, we plan to:

- Enhance GoLand’s support for Go, including comprehensive support for Go 1.24, and improve its code quality tools and static analysis tools.

- Improve the overall stability of the IDE, ensuring smoother workflows and addressing key issues in performance, reliability, and accuracy.

- Introduce various UI/UX improvements.

We encourage you to vote for the issues you want to see fixed and the features you want us to implement.

### **Early Access Program 101**

If you’re not familiar with our Early Access Program (EAP), here’s a brief overview:

EAP builds let you try out the latest features and enhancements in GoLand while we continue working on them. These builds are not fully tested and might be unstable, but this is where you can help us. By taking these builds and their new features for a test drive in your real-world projects and scenarios, you can help us polish them. This way, when the final version is released, it will work smoothly for you.

- The EAP lets you be among the first to try out the newest features.

- EAP builds are free to use for 30 days from the build date. You can use this period as an extended trial of GoLand.

- We provide a series of EAP builds until a stable release is almost ready. For the upcoming 2025.1 version, the EAP period will last until the beginning of March.

- In each release cycle, we offer a free one-year GoLand subscription to the most active evaluators and users who helped us make GoLand better by sharing their product experience, feedback, and suggestions.

- Fresh builds come out almost every day. If you don’t want to wait for the official EAP build announcements, you can download our nightly builds, which are only available via the Toolbox App. Note that the nightly builds often do not meet the quality standards for official EAP builds, and they don’t come with release notes. Like EAP builds, they expire within 30 days of being released.

Try out this EAP build and stay tuned for future updates!
