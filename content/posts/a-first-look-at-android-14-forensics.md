Android 14 was released to the public by the Open Handset Alliance on October 4, 2023, and is now available on various smartphones, including the Google Pixel.

This blog post aims to explore a list of the majr oartifacts you can find on this version of the Android OS. 

For testing and review, I set up a Google Pixel 7A and used it for about a month, with a SIM card and various native and third-party apps installed.

The blog post is organized by sections:

- Device information and general settings
- User accounts
- Information on Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connections
- Native Android applications
- Google applications
- Analysis of the use of native and third-party applications
- Other relevant information

As always, I'll try to update this blog post as I test and research.

## Device information and general settings

- **build.prop**

- TXT format
- Stored in the root directory of the system partition 
- Among other things, it contains the device manufacturer, the device model, the operating system version, and the build version
- aLEAPP plugin

- **global\_settings.xml**

- ABX format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system/users/0/"
- Contains global settings such as automatic time adjustment, Wi-Fi on/off, and Bluetooth on/off.

- **system\_settings.xml** 

- ABX format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system/users/0/"
- Contains system settings such as audio level and display brightness.

- **secure\_settings.xml**

- ABX format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system/users/0/"
- Contains secure settings such as the Android ID, the Bluetooth name, and accessibility. 
- aLEAPP plugin

- **googlesettings.db** 

- SQLite format 
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/data/com.android.gsf/databases/" 
- Contains settings for location services

- **gservices.db**

- SQLite format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/data/com.android.gsf/databases/" 
- Contains various settings relating to Google services

- **persistent\_properties** 

- Protobuf format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/property/" 
- Contains information about the local timezone and language settings

- **factory\_reset** and **factory\_reset\_record\_value**

- Stored in the userdata partition under "/misc/bootstat/" 
- The last modified timestamp corresponds to the timestamp of the factory reset 

- **setup\_wizard\_info.xml**

- XML format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/data/com.google.android.settings.intelligence/shared\_prefs/"
- It stores the value "suw\_finished\_time\_ms", which corresponds to the timestamp of the device setup
- aLEAPP plugin

- **suggestions.xml**

- XML format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/data/com.google.android.settings.intelligence/shared\_prefs/"
- It stores the values "com.android.settings.suggested.category.DEFERRED\_SETUP\_setup\_time" and "com.android.settings/com.android.settings.biometrics.fingerprint.FingerprintEnrollSuggestionActivity\_setup\_time", which match the device setup timestamp
- aLEAPP plugin

- **notification\_policy.xml**

- ABX format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system/"
- It tracks whether notifications are visible on the lock screen

I have covered the Android settings in a previous blog post "Analysis of Android settings during a forensic investigation". I recommend also reading the two posts by Josh Hickman where he describes how to analyze how an Android device was set up.

- Wipeout! Detecting Android Factory Resets
- Wipeout! Part Deux – Determining How an Android Was Setup

## Accounts information

- **0.xml**

- ABX format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system/users/0/"
- Contains information about the local user account, including the last logon date

- **accounts\_ce.db** 

- SQLite format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system\_ce/0/"
- Contains information about accounts used on the device, such as Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, etc., possibly including passwords/tokens
- For each account

- Account name
- Account type
- Password/token

- aLEAPP plugin
- aLEAPP authtokens plugin

- **accounts\_de.db** 

- SQLite format
- Contains information about accounts used on the device, such as Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, etc., possibly including passwords/tokens
- For each account

- Account name
- Account type
- Action type (action\_account\_add, action\_set\_password, and so on)
- Debug time

- aLEAPP plugin

- **accounts.xml**

- ABX format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/system/sync/"
- Stores information about data synchronization via the Google Account

- **google\_account\_history.db**

- SQLite format
- Stored in the userdata partition under "/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/"
- Contains a single table of interest ("AccountHistory")
- Stores the history of all Google accounts set up and used on the device

It's important to note this:

1. There can be more than one local user. The first user is user 0, and if you examine the "/system/users/" folder, you may find more local users. A fairly common example on a Samsung device is the local user that manages the "Secret Folder" and is usually numbered 150
2. Third-party applications aren't required to store information in the accounts\_ce.db or accounts\_en.db. These files must therefore be considered as a starting point, which must be expanded by analyzing all sandboxes of all relevant applications

## Cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth configuration

Some interesting blog posts you should read about these files are:

Once you have identified the installed applications, you should analyze:

1. The "**/app/**" folder in the userdata partition, to find the APK for a specific app
