One of the foremost obstacles is the disconnect between senior executives and cybersecurity priorities. Despite recognizing cyber resilience as a crucial imperative, many US SLED organizations struggle to secure the support and resources from top leadership. This lack of engagement hinders progress and leaves institutions vulnerable to potential breaches.

Meanwhile, technology continues to advance astonishingly, as do the risks posed by cyber threats. The 2024 LevelBlue Futures™ Report reveals this delicate balancing act between innovation and security within the US SLED sector. Our comprehensive analysis identifies opportunities for deeper alignment between executive leadership and technical teams.

## The Elusive Quest for Cyber Resilience in US SLED

Imagine a world where US SLED organizations are impervious to cyber threats—where every aspect of an operation is fortified against disruptions. This is the lofty ideal of cyber resilience, yet it remains an elusive goal for many US SLED providers. The rapid evolution of computing has transformed the IT landscape, blurring the lines between legacy systems, cloud computing, and digital transformation initiatives. While these advancements bring undeniable benefits, they also introduce unprecedented risks.

Our research indicates that 86% of US SLED respondents agree that dynamic computing increases their risk exposure. In a world where cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the need for cyber resilience has never been more urgent. From ransomware attacks to crippling DDoS incidents, US SLED organizations operate in a climate where a single breach can have catastrophic consequences.
