Cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities—but it’s also a favorite playground for scammers.  

With the rapid rise of deepfake technology and deceptive AI-driven schemes, even seasoned investors can fall victim to fraud. According to McAfee’s _State of the Scamiverse_ report, deepfake scams are on the rise, with the average American now encountering 2.6 deepfake videos daily. And younger adults (18-24) see even more – about 3.5 per day. 

From fake investment opportunities to phishing attempts, bad actors are more sophisticated than ever.  

The recent wave of Trump-themed meme coins—more than 700 copycats attempting to mimic the real thing—highlights just how rampant crypto scams have become. If even the president’s cryptocurrency isn’t safe from impersonators, how can everyday investors protect themselves? 

By knowing the red flags, you can safeguard your money and personal data from crypto scammers. 

## **Five Red Flags That Signal a Crypto Scam** 

### **1) Too-Good-To-Be-True Promises**

Scammers often lure victims with **guaranteed returns** or impossibly high profits. If an investment promises **“risk-free” earnings** or sounds like a financial miracle, **run the other way**—legitimate investments always carry some level of risk. 

**Example:** A Ponzi scheme disguised as a crypto investment fund may claim to offer **“10% daily profits”** or “instant payouts.” In reality, they use new investors’ money to pay early participants—until the scam collapses.

### **2) Celebrity Endorsements That Don’t Add Up**

Fraudsters frequently **impersonate public figures**—from Elon Musk to Donald Trump—to promote fake coins or crypto investments. The explosion of Trump-themed meme coins shows how easily scammers exploit famous names. **Even if a project appears linked to a well-known figure, verify through official channels.** 

**Example:** A deepfake video featuring a celebrity “endorsing” a new crypto token. McAfee’s research found that **nearly 3 deepfake videos per day** are encountered by the average American, many of them tied to scams. 

### **3) Fake Exchanges & Wallets**

Scammers often set up **fraudulent crypto exchanges** or wallet apps that look legitimate but are designed to steal your money. They might advertise **low fees, special bonuses, or exclusive access** to new coins. 

**How to Protect Yourself:**

### **4) Pressure to Act Fast**

Scammers thrive on urgency. They’ll push you to act **immediately** before you have time to think critically. Whether it’s a limited-time **pre-sale** or a “secret investment opportunity,” **don’t let fear of missing out (FOMO) cloud your judgment.** 

**Example:** “Only 10 spots left! Invest now before prices skyrocket!”—Classic scam tactics designed to trigger impulsive decisions.

### **5) Requests for Upfront Payments or Private Keys**

No legitimate crypto project will ever ask for: 

- Your **private keys** or **wallet seed phrase**. 
- An **upfront fee** before you can “withdraw” funds. 
- Payment via **gift cards or wire transfers**. 

**Example:** A fake customer support email pretending to be from Coinbase, asking you to confirm your wallet password—this is a phishing attempt! 

## **How to Stay Safe from Crypto Scams**
