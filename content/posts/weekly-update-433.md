It sounds easy - "just verify people's age before they access the service" - but whether we're talking about porn in the US or Australia's incoming social media laws, the reality is _way_ more complex than that. There's no unified approach across jurisdictions and even within a single country like Australia, the closest we've got to that is a government scheme usually intended for accessing public services. And even if there _was_ a technically workable model, who wants to get either the gov or some big tech firm involved in their use of Instagram or Pornhub?! There's a _social_ acceptance to be considered and not only that, circumvention of age controls is _very_ easy when you can simply VPN into another jurisdiction and access the same website blocked in your locale. Or in the case of the adult material, I'm told (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) there are many other legally operating websites in other parts of the world that are less inclined to block individuals in specific states from foreign countries. There'll be no easy solutions for this one, but it'll make for an entertaining year üòä
