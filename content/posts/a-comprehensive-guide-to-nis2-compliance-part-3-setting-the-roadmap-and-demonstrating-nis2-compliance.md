In this third and final part of the series, I’ll provide some tips on how to set up your roadmap and effectively demonstrate compliance without overburdening your teams. 

If you’re just joining the fun now, in our two previous editions we covered who NIS2 applies to and what requirements it sets out. Be sure to have a look at them if you need any additional context. 

**How to set up the roadmap to comply with NIS2?** 

Now that you know how NIS2 applies to you and have a good understanding of what the requirements look like, it’s time to set up your roadmap for compliance. 

Here are our tips on how to get started:

1. **Perform a gap analysis:** Now that you understand the controls that NIS2 prescribes, you should identify the requirements you’re already meeting,which ones you still need to implement and which ones requireimprovement.
2. **Define action plans:** Write detailed action plans on how you are going to implement/improve processes and controls to meet NIS2 requirements. _Don’t complicate it:_ don’t be afraid to start small and build upon it. For instance, you don’t need to dedicate a lot of time and resources to automation at the first step. Instead, you should focus on laying down a good foundation for processes and controls and work later on automation.
3. **Set up the schedule:** From the above you have a list of items to work on with a detailed plan. Prioritize them based on complexity, criticality and effort. Identify _quick wins_ (those items that can be easily implemented or improved) and scale up your security posture.
4. **Conduct assurance checks:** Once action plans are implemented, conduct an assessment or audit to guarantee that controls were correctly implemented and are operating effectively. This can be done either internally (internal audit, compliance teams) or by external assessors (external auditors and consultants).

After you complete your roadmap, you’re ready to start demonstrating your compliance and showcasing it to the world and your stakeholders. Let’s see how to do that.

# **How do you demonstrate NIS2 cybersecurity compliance in an effective manner ?** 

If you’re in scope for EU NIS2, my bet is that you already maintain numerous control frameworks across your business to ensure compliance across all business lines. You probably have different audits throughout the year (maybe with different auditors as well) which bring a heavy burden on compliance and operational teams.

EU NIS2 does not provide for the possibility of self-attestation. You’ll need to get certification or accreditation from an approved certifying body in order to demonstrate your compliance with the Directive.

While this might seem like a routine process  that simply involves having (_another_) audit, the compliance landscape is continuously growing for European businesses and  international companies that want to do business in the European Union market. EU NIS2 adds to the already existing regulations and the ones to be adopted in the near future, coupled with industry certifications already held by companies (e.g. ISO27001). This brings complexity to the mix and results in many different audits to fulfill similar requirements.

Trying to ease this burden for companies in such context, the EU and ENISA have started the EU Cybersecurity Certification Scheme on Common Criteria (EUCC), which will provide an EU-wide certification scheme for companies to certify and claim compliance with different regulations, based on the Assurance Level and/or Protection Profile they choose to adhere to.

My advice would be to take advantage of that and get your EUCC certification. The idea to “test-once-and-comply-to-many” is very much welcome since the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly more difficult to navigate.

Watch this space though. Scheme candidates will be formalized and more details will be provided by ENISA in the near future.
