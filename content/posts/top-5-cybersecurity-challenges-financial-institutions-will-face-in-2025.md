Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 27, 2025

The financial services sector has long been a primary target for cybercriminals and the year 2025 will be no exception, according to BreachLock, a top cybersecurity company recognized by Gartner from 2021 to 2024 as a leading vendor in the Penetration Testing as a Service market.

There are five top cyber security challenges financial service institutions (FSIs) are likely to face in 2025:

1\. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

2\. Ransomware-as-a- Service (RaaS)

3\. Third-Party and Supply Chain Risks

4\. API Security Vulnerabilities

5\. Regulatory Compliance

BreachLock explores the reasons behind these challenges and practical solutions to mitigate them.

As financial institutions adapt to new regulatory requirements and a fast-evolving digital landscape in 2025, cybersecurity will remain a critical priority. Challenges such as APTs, RaaS, and supply chain risks require proactive security strategies and tools to mitigate risks.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and modern unified platforms that integrate these technologies, FSIs can safeguard their assets, data, and reputation against persistent threats.
