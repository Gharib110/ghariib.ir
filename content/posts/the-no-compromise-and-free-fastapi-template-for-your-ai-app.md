## The Problem

Every time we start a new FastAPI project, we spend hours setting up:

- Project structure
- Authentication
- Security configurations
- CI/CD pipelines
- Development tools
- Documentation

Why reinvent the wheel each time?

## Enter Gitemplate

A template that's:

- üöÄ Production-ready out of the box
- üõ°Ô∏è Secure by default
- üß∞ Complete with modern tooling
- üìö Well-documented
- üéØ Perfect for AI/ML projects, microservices, and web applications

## Key Features

### 1\. Production-Grade Architecture

- Built-in rate limiting
- Trusted host middleware
- Security headers configuration
- CORS configuration
- Environment variables management

### 2\. Developer Experience

- Pre-configured development tools (Black, isort, pylint, mypy)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Hot reload during development

### 3\. Modern Tech Stack

- FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- Jinja2 for templating
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Docker support
- CI/CD workflows

## Real-World Example

Take gitingest.com for example - it started as a quick project using this template and has grown into a collaborative success with 20+ contributors. The solid foundation enabled both rapid development AND sustainable growth.
