At Tuta our focus is to keep our users' data secure with quantum-safe encryption. To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords and the password length are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But given new threats of quantum computers, what is the optimal minimum password length recommended by NIST and CISA?
