Did you know that **Uniswap**, one of the most popular decentralized exchanges, was conceived during an Ethereum hackathon?

Fast forward to 2025, and hackathons such as Compound and Polygon continue to serve as launchpads for groundbreaking innovations. These events are where revolutionary ideas take shape!

But hackathons aren’t just for experienced developers—they’re also perfect for beginners. Whether you’re attending your first hackathon to learn, build, or network, 2025 is the perfect year to get started. This guide will help you prepare for your first hackathon, navigate the event, and maximize the exciting opportunities these events offer.

## Before the Event: Prepare Like a Pro

### Understand the Event Format

Hackathons can take place in-person, online, or hybrid. Check the event’s theme, schedule, and rules to know what to expect.

### Pack the Essentials

- For in-person events: Bring your laptop, chargers, headphones, snacks, and a reusable water bottle.
    
- For online events: Ensure a stable internet connection and quiet workspace.
    

### Build or Join a Team

Many hackathons let you form teams in advance. Choose teammates with complementary skills, e.g., developers, designers, and product managers.

### Brush Up on Relevant Skills

Review the tools, APIs, or programming languages you might use. Many hackathons also offer pre-event workshops—take advantage of these!

## During the Event: Work Hard, Have Fun

Hackathons are fast-paced but incredibly fulfilling. Here’s how to thrive:

### Brainstorm

- Focus on solving a specific problem that excites your team.
    
- Keep project scope realistic for the time available.
    

### Communicate Effectively

- Use tools like Slack or Discord to stay connected with your team.
    
- Divide tasks based on strengths, and sync up regularly to stay aligned.
    

### Stay Energized

- **Food and hydration:** Snack regularly, drink water, and fuel up with nutritious meals.
    
- **Rest and breaks:** Take breaks every few hours to refresh your mind and avoid burnout.
    

### Manage Your Time

- Create a timeline for your project, breaking tasks into manageable chunks.
    
- Try methods such as the Pomodoro Technique to stay productive.

## After the Event: Celebrate and Share

### Showcase Your Work

Present your project confidently during the demo or submission phase, even if it’s a prototype. Hackathons value creativity and effort as much as completion.

### Reflect on Your Experience

What did you learn? What could you improve next time? Who did you meet?

### Share Your Achievements

Use platforms like **Vaunt** to showcase your work with **Developer Cards** or highlight your badges for milestones achieved during the hackathon. Vaunt connects you with the broader developer community and proudly exhibits your contributions, turning your hard work into tangible career assets.

### Continue the Momentum

- Polish your project, then publish it on GitHub or an open-source repository.
    
- Stay connected with your team and mentors for future collaborations.
