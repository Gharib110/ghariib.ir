Not to be confused with the titular Linux mascot and seabird cousin, the penguin, puffins are another distinctively colorful and whimsical nautical avian. Over the centuries, these beaky birds have been given numerous nicknames and monikers like the “sea parrot” and the harlequinesque appearance of their facial feathers has earned them the distinction of “Clown of the Sea”. 

The _Fratercula_ family, to which puffins belong, has Latin roots that pay homage to its namesake’s connection to the clergy. It’s said that the bird’s striking black-and-white plumage was reminiscent of the formal attire worn by friars and monks, lending an air of reverence to this charismatic fowl.

With the release of Ubuntu 25.04, this pudgy little sea fowl is getting another title of affection – **Plucky** – befitting of a bird who can swim as fast and efficiently as she flies. We are proud to unveil the wallpaper for the upcoming release of Ubuntu aiming to capture the essence of this versatile and charming little creature.

## A seashore adventure

When tasked with depicting our intrepid mascot, the Design team at Canonical found inspiration from the puffin’s bold resilience. Marcus Haslam, the Magician, explains:

> “For the latest 25.04 mascot, I wanted to capture the spirit of being ‘plucky’ in a fun and approachable way. Puffins tend to look a bit quirky at first, so I set out to give this one a strong and proud personality. I introduced a stormy sea to add energy and a sense of adventure—plus it set the stage for a cool animation later on!  
>   
> “Since the wild sea could easily feel overwhelming, I added a circle to bring everything together. I let the puffin’s head break out of the circle, which hints that it’s confidently taking charge. The detail of using the Circle of Friends as the puffin’s eye not only ties back to Ubuntu but also gives a warm nod to community and friendship. (Look closer there is further nod to the CoF)  
>   
> “Overall, I aimed for a design that’s both courageous and friendly—a little reminder that sometimes being a bit different is what makes you truly special.”
