The New York Blood Center Enterprises (NYBC), a vital organization responsible for supplying blood and blood products to hospitals across the region, has fallen victim to a ransomware attack.

The incident has significantly disrupted its IT systems, forcing the organization to implement emergency measures while cybersecurity experts work to prevent the threat.

The NYBC detected “suspicious activity” on its IT systems on Sunday and immediately launched an investigation with the help of third-party cybersecurity specialists.

The investigation confirmed the organization had been targeted by a ransomware attack—a type of malicious software designed to encrypt a victim’s files or systems until a ransom is paid to the attackers.

Key systems were taken offline as a precautionary measure to contain the attack and prevent further damage. NYBC announced that it is working diligently to restore its IT infrastructure, though no specific timeline for full recovery has been provided.

Authorities, including law enforcement, have been notified and are involved in the ongoing investigation.“The investigation has confirmed that the suspicious activity is a result of a ransomware incident.

We took immediate steps to help contain the threat, including taking certain systems offline”, NYBC stated.“We are working diligently with these experts to restore our systems as quickly and as safely as possible”.

Ransomware attacks often target sensitive data, and while NYBC has not disclosed whether any confidential donor or patient information was compromised, such breaches pose significant risks, including potential data theft.

Experts warn that healthcare-focused organizations like NYBC are particularly appealing targets for cybercriminals due to the critical and time-sensitive nature of their operations.

## **Impact On Blood Donation Services**

Despite the attack, NYBC continues to operate its donor centers and community blood drives while employing manual workarounds to manage its operations.

However, processing times at donation centers and blood drives have slowed, and some appointments may need to be rescheduled.”We understand the critical nature of our services, and the health of our communities remains our top priority.

We remain in direct communication with our hospital partners and are implementing workarounds to help restore services and fulfill orders,” the NYBC said.

NYBC has also received overwhelming support from hospital associations, blood centers across the country, and the AABB Interorganizational Task Force, indicating a shared commitment to maintaining the blood supply chain during this crisis.

NYBC is urging eligible donors to remain patient and continue supporting their mission despite possible delays at donation centers. In the coming weeks, additional blood donation drives may be required as the organization navigates through the aftermath of the attack.
