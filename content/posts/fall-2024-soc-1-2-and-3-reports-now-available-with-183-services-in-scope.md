We continue to expand the scope of our assurance programs at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and are pleased to announce that the Fall 2024 System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1, 2, and 3 reports are now available. The reports cover 183 services over the 12-month period from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, so that customers have a full year of assurance with the reports. These reports demonstrate our continuous commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for cloud service providers.

Going forward, we will issue SOC reports covering a 12-month period each quarter as follows:

| **Report** | **Period covered** |
| --- | --- |
| Spring SOC 1, 2, and 3 | April 1–March 31 |
| Summer SOC 1 | July 1–June 30 |
| Fall SOC 1, 2, and 3 | October 1–September 30 |
| Winter SOC 1 | January 1–December 31 |

Customers can download the Fall 2024 SOC 1, 2, and 3 reports through AWS Artifact, a self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. Sign in to AWS Artifact in the AWS Management Console, or learn more at Getting Started with AWS Artifact.

AWS strives to continuously bring services into the scope of its compliance programs to help you meet your architectural and regulatory needs. If you have questions or feedback about SOC compliance, reach out to your AWS account team.
