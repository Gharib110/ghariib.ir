Upgrade your storage with RAM for quick access to important data.

Do you find yourself suffering with slower transfer rates when working with lots of data? That's where a RAM disk can come into play. By using available random access memory (RAM) not currently reserved for other software, you can store a substantial amount of data with quick access to the CPU. The fastest PCIe 5.0 drives will offer speeds up to around 16 GB/s, which is nothing to snuff at, but a RAM disk could provide 40 GB/s. That's more than double what the fastest dedicated storage drives will offer and thankfully it's not too difficult to create a RAM disk using Windows.
