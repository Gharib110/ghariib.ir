title: "UnitedHealth almost doubles victim numbers from massive Change Healthcare data breach"

UnitedHealth says it now estimates that the data breach on its subsidiary Change Healthcare affected 190 million people, nearly doubling its previous estimate from October.

In May, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty estimated that the ransomware attack compromised the data of a third of US individuals when he testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill. In October, this was largely confirmed when Change Healthcare reported a number of 100,000,000 affected individuals.

Besides the enormous number of victims, the story behind this ransomware attack is also very complex, because of the cybercriminals involved and how the first group that received the ransom payment disappeared without paying their affiliates.

The ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group claimed the initial attack. The UnitedHealth Group reportedly paid $22 million to receive a decryptor and to prevent the attackers from publicly releasing the stolen data.

But shortly after the payment, ALPHV disappeared in an unconvincing exit scam designed to make it look as if the group’s website had been seized by the FBI, forgetting to pay its affiliates in the process. A month later, newcomer ransomware group RansomHub listed Change Healthcare as a victim on its own website, claiming to have the data that ALPHV stole.

According to BleepingComputer, the original attackers joined forces with RansomHub and never deleted the data. A few days later, the listing on the RansomHub leaks site disappeared, which usually means someone paid the ransom.

## Stolen information

The data breach at Change Healthcare is the largest healthcare data breach in US history. Although Change Healthcare provided details about the types of medical and patient data that was stolen, it can’t provide exact details for every individual. However, the exposed information may include:

- Contact information: Names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and email addresses.

- Health insurance information: Details about primary, secondary, or other health plans/policies, insurance companies, member/group ID numbers, and Medicaid-Medicare-government payor ID numbers.

- Health information: Medical record numbers, providers, diagnoses, medicines, test results, images, and details of care and treatment.

- Billing, claims, and payment information: Claim numbers, account numbers, billing codes, payment card details, financial and banking information, payments made, and balances due.

- Other personal information: Social Security numbers, driver’s license or state ID numbers, and passport numbers.

Change Healthcare added:

> “The information that may have been involved will not be the same for every impacted individual. To date, we have not yet seen full medical histories appear in the data review.”

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the victim of a data breach.

- **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened and follow any specific advice they offer.

- **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a strong password that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a password manager choose one for you.

- **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) can be phished just as easily as a password. 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.

- **Watch out for fake vendors.** The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the vendor website to see if they are contacting victims, and verify the identity of anyone who contacts you using a different communication channel.

- **Take your time.** Phishing attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions, and security alerts.

- **Consider not storing your card details**. It’s definitely more convenient to get sites to remember your card details for you, but we highly recommend not storing that information on websites.

- **Set up identity monitoring.** Identity monitoring alerts you if your personal information is found being traded illegally online, and helps you recover after.
