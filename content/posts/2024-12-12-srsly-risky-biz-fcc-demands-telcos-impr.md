# Srsly Risky Biz FCC demands telcos improve security

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about the US Federal Communications Commission effort to get US telcos to lift their security game and compares it to UK and Australian efforts. The US is very late to the game, and improving security is a huge job.

They also talk about Chinese cyber actors continuing to pointlessly sow chaos and how an influence campaign in Romania is an absolute disaster for TikTok.

This episode is also available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/pKqXR4gXpv8).
