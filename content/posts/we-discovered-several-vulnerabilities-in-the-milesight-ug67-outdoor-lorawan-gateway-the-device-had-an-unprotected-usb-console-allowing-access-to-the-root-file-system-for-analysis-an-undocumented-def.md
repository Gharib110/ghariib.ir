title: "We discovered several vulnerabilities in the Milesight UG67 Outdoor LoRaWAN Gateway. The device had an unprotected USB console allowing access to the root file-system for analysis, an undocumented default password usable for remote SSH login, a command execution circumventing the restricted shell and a local privilege escalation using ubus as well as a local privilege escalation using world-writeable webroot. The issues can be combined to allow privileged access from a remote connection."
