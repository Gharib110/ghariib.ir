We’re excited to share how IT Revolution is evolving in 2025. While our books and research papers will always be your go-to source for deep insights into digital transformation, DevOps, and organizational leadership, we’re introducing something new to help you quickly find the guidance you need.

### **The Best of Both Worlds: AI Tools + Human Expertise**

Starting in 2025, we’re trying something different. We’ll use AI tools to help us synthesize patterns and connections across our library. But here’s what won’t change: our commitment to quality and human oversight. Every piece we publish will be:

- Born from the expertise of our editorial team, who carefully craft and review each post to ensure it captures the true essence of our authors’ work.

- Rooted directly in our authors’ original research, books, and papers, with proper attribution.

- Designed to give you a taste of the deeper insights you’ll find in our full-length publications.

### **What’s Coming Your Way**

Get ready for focused blog posts tackling the challenges you face every day—from modern leadership to building high-performing teams and mastering value stream management. Each piece will:

- Connect the dots between insights from across the IT Revolution library.

- Give you practical steps you can take right away.

- Point you to the original works where you can dive deeper.

- Pass through our editorial team’s rigorous review process.

We’re kicking off our first themed series in January 2025. Think of these posts as your personal guide to our vast knowledge base—helping you quickly find the books and papers that will best support your leadership journey.
