We’re excited to announce that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has completed the annual Dubai Electronic Security Centre (DESC) certification audit to operate as a Tier 1 Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for the AWS Middle East (UAE) Region.

This alignment with DESC requirements demonstrates our continued commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for CSPs. Government customers of AWS can run their applications in AWS Cloud-certified Regions with confidence.

The independent third-party auditor (BSI) issued the Certificate of Compliance to AWS on behalf of DESC on January 23, 2025. The Certificate of Compliance that illustrates the compliance status of AWS is available through AWS Artifact. AWS Artifact is a self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. Sign in to AWS Artifact in the AWS Management Console, or learn more at Getting Started with AWS Artifact.

The certification includes 11 additional services in scope, for a total of 98 services. This is a 13% year-on-year increase in the number of services in the Middle East (UAE) Region that are in scope of the DESC CSP certification. For up-to-date information, including when additional services are added, see the AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program webpage and choose **DESC CSP**.

AWS strives to continuously bring services into the scope of its compliance programs to help you adhere to your architectural and regulatory needs. If you have questions or feedback about DESC compliance, reach out to your AWS account team.
