# Srsly Risky Biz Why hack and leak is still a big deal

<br/>

<br/>
In this podcast Tom Uren and Adam Boileau talk about the continued importance of hack and leak operations. They didnâ€™t really affect the recent US presidential election, but they are still a powerful tool for vested interests to influence public policy.

They also discuss the police bust of MATRIX, yet another encrypted messenger that is marketed to criminals and designed to resist police surveillance. The crimephone landscape is splintering due to the constant drumbeat of police success.

This episode is also available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/8X4AgxhKg-8).
