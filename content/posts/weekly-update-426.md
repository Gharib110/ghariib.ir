I have absolutely no problem at all talking about the code I've screwed up. Perhaps that's partly because after 3 decades of writing software (and doing some meaningful stuff along the way), I'm not particularly concerned about showing my weaknesses. And this week, I screwed up a bunch of stuff; database queries that weren't resilient to SQL database scale changes, partially completed breach notifications I didn't notice until it was too late to easily fix, and some queries that performed so badly they crashed the entire breach notification process after loading the massive DemandScience incident. Fortunately, none of them had any impact of note, we fixed them all and re-ran processes, and now we're more resilient than ever ðŸ˜„

Oh - and if you like this style of content, this coming Friday, Stefan and I will do a joint live stream on all sorts of other bits about how now HIBP runs.
