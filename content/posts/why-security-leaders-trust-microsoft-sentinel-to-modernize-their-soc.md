Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions have long served as the indispensable nerve center for the security operations center (SOC). However, the SIEM landscape has undergone seismic shifts and market disruption in recent times, making it that much harder for chief information security officers (CISOs) to navigate and select the optimal SIEM for their needs.

Several well-established, traditional SIEMs have been acquired by bigger vendors, raising uncertainty around their future product roadmap and long-term support commitments. Additionally, legacy on-premises SIEMs demand substantial infrastructure investments, require extensive configuration expertise, and constant maintenance—resulting in high operational costs and inefficiencies. Even more critically, traditional SIEMs often struggle to scale or adapt to the evolving cyberthreat landscape. Their rigid architecture and lack of flexibility leave organizations exposed to sophisticated, fast-changing threats.    

In contrast, newer entrants to the SIEM market, typically founded in adjacent security markets, promise innovation but often lack maturity, proven reliability, and feature completeness. Their solutions can leave organizations grappling with gaps in coverage or integration challenges. Similarly, data lake providers have entered the scene with do-it-yourself security solutions that involve complex, multivendor integrations. While these may appeal to organizations seeking flexibility, they frequently demand high levels of customization and operational expertise—an approach yet to demonstrate consistent success.

## Security operation centers require a modern SIEM

As cyberattacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, an effective and comprehensive SIEM has never been more important. Given the churn in the industry, Microsoft Sentinel stands out as an established leader in the category, delivering results and innovation year after year. So many CISOs are increasingly switching to Microsoft Sentinel to gain cloud flexibility and broad coverage to protect the entire digital ecosystem. In fact, today, more than 25,000 customers trust Microsoft Sentinel to help them stay ahead of even the most emergent cyberthreats, driving innovation with next generation AI and automation, strong threat intelligence, and robust, built-in capabilities. Learn more about why Microsoft Sentinel is the choice for security professionals.
