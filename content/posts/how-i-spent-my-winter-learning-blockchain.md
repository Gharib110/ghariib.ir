title: "How I Spent My Winter Learning Blockchain"

This past December, I dedicated my winter vacation to diving into the world of blockchain technology. My main goal was to learn enough to contribute to a project my club was working on for an upcoming event. Hereâ€™s a little about my journey, what I learned, and what we built!

### What I Learned

I started with the **basics of blockchain technology**, including fundamental terms, hashing algorithms, and how blockchains achieve decentralization. Then, I explored two of the most popular blockchains:

- **Bitcoin**: Understanding its origin, features, and how mining works to validate transactions.
- **Ethereum**: Learning about its history, smart contracts, and how it split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

As we decided to use **Ethereum** for our project, I spent time learning **Solidity**, the language used for writing smart contracts. We didnâ€™t directly deploy on the Ethereum mainnet, though. Instead, we used **Ganache** for local blockchain deployment to simulate the Ethereum environment. This allowed us to develop and test our contracts efficiently without worrying about gas fees on the mainnet.

We also used **Truffle**, a development framework, for compiling, deploying, and managing our smart contracts. It simplified our workflow significantly and helped us integrate the blockchain components seamlessly with our application.

Additionally, we incorporated **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** for decentralized storage of NFT assets like spaceship skins and backgrounds. Learning how IPFS ensures distributed, immutable storage added a unique layer to the project.

### Why I Learned Blockchain

My club organized an event that featured a dedicated **blockchain section**. I felt this was the perfect opportunity to learn about blockchain and take part in this section. The idea of exploring a completely new technology excited me, so I decided to dive deep into it with my team during the month of December.

### What We Built: SpaceWars

Our project was **SpaceWars**, a retro-inspired space shooter game integrated with blockchain technology. Here's what makes it special:

- **NFT Integration**: Players can mint their own spaceship skins and background environments as NFTs.
- **Marketplace**: Players can sell, buy, and trade their NFTs within the game.
- **In-Game Use**: Custom NFTs arenâ€™t just collectiblesâ€”theyâ€™re fully functional in the game, adding a layer of personalization and ownership.

This was my first hands-on experience with blockchain development, and it was an incredible learning opportunity. From writing smart contracts in Solidity to deploying them locally with Ganache and Truffle, and integrating IPFS for decentralized storage, I gained practical skills Iâ€™m excited to build upon.

### Final Thoughts

Learning blockchain was a steep but rewarding curve. By the end of December, not only did I gain a strong understanding of blockchain fundamentals, but I also got to apply my knowledge in a fun and creative way. Seeing SpaceWars come to life with my team was a highlight of my winter vacation.

I canâ€™t wait to explore more about this technology and its possibilities. Have you ever worked on a blockchain project or dabbled in this field? Let me know in the comments! ðŸš€
