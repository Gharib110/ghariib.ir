The lowest price we've seen, so get it while you can

If you're looking for a PC case that's going to provide tons of airflow for your components, look no further than Corsair's 5000D Airflow. Not only does this keep your components cool thanks to its great design, but it also looks good as well. While this case normally comes priced at $175, it can now be had for just $100 for a limited time when you grab it from Amazon. But be quick because this massive 43% discount won't be around for long.
