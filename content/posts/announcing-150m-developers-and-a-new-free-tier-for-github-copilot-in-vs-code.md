Come and join 150M developers on GitHub that can now code with Copilot for free in VS Code.

The post Announcing 150M developers and a new free tier for GitHub Copilot in VS Code appeared first on The GitHub Blog.

GitHub has a long history of offering free products and services to developers. Starting with free open source and public collaboration, we added free private repos, free minutes for GitHub Actions and GitHub Codespaces, and free package and release storage. Today, we are adding GitHub Copilot to the mix by launching GitHub Copilot Free.

Now automatically integrated into VS Code, all of you have access to 2,000 code completions and 50 chat messages per month, simply by signing in with your personal GitHub account. Or by creating a new one. And just last week, we passed the mark of 150M developers on GitHub. ![ðŸŽ‰](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f389.png)

Copilot Free gives you the choice between Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3.5 Sonnet or OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model. You can ask a coding question, explain existing code, or have it find a bug. You can execute edits across multiple files. And you can access Copilotâ€™s third-party agents or build your own extension.

Did you know that Copilot Chat is now directly available from the GitHub dashboard and it works with Copilot Free, so you can start using it today? We couldnâ€™t be more excited to make Copilot available to the 150M developers on GitHub.

Happy coding!

_P.S. Students, educators, and open source maintainers: your free access to unlimited Copilot Pro accounts continues, unaffected! ![ðŸ˜‰](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png)_
