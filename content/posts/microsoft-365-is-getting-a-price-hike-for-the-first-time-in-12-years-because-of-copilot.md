Don't like AI tools? Well, now you're paying for them anyway.

How much do you use the Copilot features on Microsoft 365? If your answer to that is "not a lot," then there's some bad news on the horizon. Your monthly bill for using the service is about to go up, and it's likely due to the addition of AI services across the platform. Worst of all, you can't opt out of this price rise, either; everyone is getting hit by it regardless of how much they use (or want) Copilot.
