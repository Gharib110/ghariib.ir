![OK Cloud, On-Prem is Alright](https://blog.container-solutions.com/hubfs/ok-computer.jpeg)

As someone who has worked in software since 2001, and in the Cloud Native (containerisation and Kubernetes) space since 2013, I'm getting old enough to have seen trends come and go a few times. VMs came (and stayed), continuous integration went from a fad talked about by gurus to the mainstream of software delivery, and containers went from some changes Google made to the Linux kernel to the _de facto_ standard for software packaging, and then on to the foundation for Kubernetes, an industry-standard software deployment platform.  
  
But it's another thing to see a wave come, and then see it recede for a time before you expect it to rise again. And in the last years, we at Container Solutions have observed that more and more of the decision-makers in our industry have shifted their stance on the cloud to the point where it became impossible for us to ignore.
