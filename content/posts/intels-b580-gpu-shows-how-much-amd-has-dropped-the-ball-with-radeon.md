How are you going to let a newcomer show you up on their second kick at the can?

For years now, the king of the graphics card castle has been obvious. NVIDIA is and continues to be the gold standard for graphics cards, and AMD’s Radeon cards could just never quite stack up. The bad news doesn’t end there; Intel’s recent launch of their B580 GPU makes matters much worse. In only their second launch, Intel has done what AMD hasn’t been able to do for generations: create a graphics card that will fly off the shelves. The B580, despite its continued teething issues, is out of stock basically everywhere and shows exactly how AMD can’t keep pointing the finger elsewhere for its poor management of the Radeon division.
