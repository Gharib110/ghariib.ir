![Why I'm No Longer Talking to Architects About Microservices](https://blog.container-solutions.com/hubfs/Screenshot%202025-03-11%20at%2015.14.16.png)

It happened again last week. I was at an architecture review meeting when a fellow architect eagerly started another debate about \*microservices\*. Within minutes, eyes glazed over and we were knee-deep in an absurd discussion about something that should have been a means to an end, but had morphed into the end itself. At that moment, I realized: I’m done. I’ve finally sworn off talking to architects about microservices. Why? Because these conversations usually go nowhere productive.
