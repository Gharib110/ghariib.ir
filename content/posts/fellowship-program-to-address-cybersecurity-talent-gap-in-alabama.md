Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 22, 2025

The Alabama Community College System in partnership with Advantage Consulting & Solutions is set to debut its inaugural class of the Alabama Cybersecurity Fellowship. Funded by Innovate Alabama, the program aims to address the growing cybersecurity talent gap in Alabama. According to Cybersecurity Ventures data cited by Forbes, there are nearly 750,000 job vacancies across the U.S.

The fellowship’s pilot semester will feature CIS students from several local community colleges. During the 16-week internship, students will work two days a week with local employers, earning $18 per hour and three college credits toward their computer science degree, gaining valuable on-the-job experience in critical areas such as cybersecurity risk management, security control implementation, secure configuration, system monitoring, and incident response.

The program is designed to foster long-term partnerships between local businesses, community colleges, and government initiatives. Students will report to their sponsored company for on-site training in early February.
