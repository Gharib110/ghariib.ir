JetBrains Marketplace provides various licensing models for paid plugins to suit different user preferences. Now, we are introducing a new option that may change how your users purchase your plugins – perpetual licensing.

## **Licensing options on JetBrains Marketplace**

The current licensing schemes available on JetBrains Marketplace include:

- **Annual/monthly subscription without a** **fallback license****:** Users can access your plugin only with an active subscription. This model is ideal for ensuring continuous revenue as users need to maintain their subscriptions to keep using the plugin.

- **Annual/monthly subscription with a fallback license:** Users receive lifetime access to a specific version of your plugin. Updates and new features are only available with an active subscription. This model strikes a balance between providing long-term value to users and encouraging them to renew their subscriptions.

The licensing type (with or without fallback) and billing period (annual/monthly) can be selected under the _Sales_ tab, in the _Sales Info_ section of the plugin page.

In addition to the options described above, we are now introducing a **perpetual license** option. This new license type allows users to make a one-time payment for lifetime access to your plugin, including all future updates. It can be an appealing choice for users who prefer a single upfront payment rather than recurring charges.

## **How to implement perpetual licenses**

- Now that you can opt for perpetual licensing for your new plugin, the perpetual license will be available as an option when you publish a new plugin on JetBrains Marketplace.

- Alternatively, if you prefer to switch your existing plugin to a perpetual licensing model, you can do so by contacting the JetBrains Marketplace team at marketplace@jetbrains.com. In this scenario, all current customers will automatically receive the perpetual license for free, while new customers will need to purchase it.

Note that a plugin can currently have only one paid license option: either recurring or perpetual.

## **Choosing the best licensing model for your plugin**

The introduction of the perpetual license gives you more flexibility in how you monetize your plugin. However, it’s essential to consider the implications carefully.

- **Revenue stability:** While a one-time payment model may attract more users initially, it can lead to less predictable revenue in the long run compared to a subscription model.

- **User satisfaction:** Perpetual licenses can increase customer satisfaction, as users appreciate the simplicity and long-term value of a single payment.

If you have any questions or need guidance on transitioning to the perpetual license model, feel free to reach out to the Marketplace Support team at marketplace@jetbrains.com.
