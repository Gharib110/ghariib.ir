Job Posting: **Postdoctoral Scholar in Quantum-resistant Cryptography**  
_Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan_

The Applied Cryptography Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) is seeking to hire a postdoctoral scholar to conduct research on quantum-resistant cryptography.

The postdoc will work on a project, part of a collaboration between Prof. Carlos Cid at OIST and Prof. Ludovic Perret at EPITA Research Lab, EPITA, Paris, France, focusing on the design and benchmarking of novel hybrid protocols for secure satellite communication that use classical and post-quantum cryptography combined with space-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The successful candidate will have experience in the design and analysis of protocols in post-quantum or quantum cryptography, with a strong motivation to work at the intersection of these two domains.

We are seeking candidates with excellent post-graduate academic formation in cryptography, mathematics, computer science, or a closely related field, with research experience in the design and analysis of protocols in post-quantum or quantum cryptography. Candidates must have a PhD at the time of commencing the position. This is a full-time, fixed-term appointment for 2 years, potentially extended depending of performance and other circumstances.

**Starting Date:** as soon as possible.

**Closing date for applications:**

**Contact:** Carlos Cid (_carlos.cid\_\[at\]\_oist.jp_) and Ludovic Perret (_ludovic.perret\_\[at\]\_epita.fr_)
