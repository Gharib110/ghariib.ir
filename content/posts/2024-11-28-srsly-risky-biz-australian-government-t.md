In this podcast Tom Uren and Patrick Gray talk about the Australian Government’s extraordinary legislation that will retrospectively ensure that warrants used for the An0m crimephone sting operation are valid.

They also discuss a sterling CISA red team report and the naiveté of Microsoft’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith.
