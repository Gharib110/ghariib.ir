70% of millennials rarely verify online identities – making them vulnerable to deception. Learn how to navigate online trust and cybersecurity with Kaspersky's expert insights.

Millennials have grown up alongside the rise of social media and digital communication – and in many ways appear to be the most tech-savvy generation. However, our latest research reveals a concerning reality: **70 percent of millennials rarely verify the authenticity of the people they engage with online**, leaving them vulnerable to cyberrisks such as identity fraud, misinformation, and emotional deception.

As digital friendships and online communities become increasingly central to daily life, many millennials need rethink their approach to online trust (actually, so do other generations, of course, but today we concentrate on the “millennial paradox”). The desire for connection and validation is driving significant behavioral shifts – from prioritizing social-media interactions over real-world relationships, to oversharing personal information in digital spaces. These trends expose users to heightened cybersecurity threats – making digital literacy and caution more important than ever.

## The trust paradox: digital natives, yet still vulnerable to deception

Despite being the first generation to embrace the internet fully, many millennials place misplaced trust in their online interactions. While **64 percent have encountered someone misrepresenting their identity**, nearly half still trust information shared within their digital communities. This contradiction highlights a gap between perceived digital expertise and actual cybersecurity awareness.

Digital paradox: millennials’ trust gap exposed

> Cyber-psychologist Ruth Guest warns that this overconfidence can lead to risky behavior. _“When we trust our own digital savvy implicitly, we may overlook the possibility that others are not as genuine as they appear. In some cases, individuals with strong narcissistic, psychopathic or Machiavellian traits exploit this trust through catfishing and other deceptive tactics.”_

Rethinking digital trust means applying a level of skepticism that matches real-world caution. A strong cybersecurity mindset requires more than technical skills – it demands critical thinking and vigilance.

## From social validation to privacy risks

Social media has become the go-to space for millennials to share major life updates – often before informing close friends or family. Our research shows that **nearly half of millennials post significant personal news online before discussing it in person with anyone**. The instant feedback from likes, comments, and shares can create a sense of validation – but it also comes with risks.

**Forty-five percent of millennials are comfortable sharing personal or sensitive information online** – a behavior that can increase their exposure to phishing scams, identity theft, and doxing. Cybercriminals use publicly available information to craft targeted attacks – exploiting personal details such as location check-ins, workplace updates, and relationship status.

Chronic oversharers: millennials risk privacy for connection

> According to Marc Rivero, Lead Security Researcher at Kaspersky, _“Oversharing personal information online can make individuals more vulnerable to identity theft, phishing attacks, and social engineering scams. Personal details shared online, such as location check-ins, relationship status, and daily routines, can be exploited for targeted scams or unauthorized surveillance.”_

To mitigate these risks, it’s important to reconsider what’s shared, strengthen privacy settings, and remain cautious about how digital footprints are being used.

## Digital friendships: a balance between connection and risk

As loneliness rises among young adults (among other generations), online friendships have become an essential part of social life. Our study found that **29 percent of millennials report that digital friendships positively impact their mental health**. Online communities provide a sense of belonging, and allow users to connect with like-minded individuals across the world.

However, not all online interactions are positive. **Ten percent of millennials report negative experiences from digital interaction**. Even more concerning, **14 percent admit to creating fake profiles or using false identities themselves**. These statistics highlight the prevalence of digital deception and the challenges of distinguishing between genuine and fabricated relationships.

> Back to cyber-psychologist Ruth Guest, she emphasizes the importance of balance. _“Digital spaces have evolved into safe and creative havens where millennials can explore, learn and connect with like-minded individuals. When used wisely and with proper safeguards, social media can be a tremendous asset to one’s mental health. It offers a platform for self-expression, a sense of belonging, and even creative inspiration. However, it is crucial to remember that the benefits of these online communities depend on maintaining a balance.”_
