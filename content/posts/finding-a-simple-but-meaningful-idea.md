This article is a reflection on my experience as a finalist in the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2024. It’s a story of how a simple idea, born from a last-minute spark of inspiration, led to a meaningful project that resonated with the judges. I hope my journey inspires you to embrace your creativity, trust your instincts, and share your passions with the world.

## About the Apple Swift Student Challenge

The Apple Swift Student Challenge is an annual opportunity for students worldwide to showcase their creativity, coding skills, and passion for Apple’s Swift programming language. Each participant builds an interactive experience in Swift Playgrounds—anything from a game to a mini-lesson—within a strict three-minute time limit. It’s both exhilarating and nerve-wracking: the perfect blend of creativity, pressure, and possibility.

Even though I missed the deadline in 2023, I was determined to submit something in 2024. Little did I know this determination would lead me to a finalist spot!

## Missing the 2023 Deadline

I’ll be honest: things weren’t looking good for me at first. In 2023, my schedule was such a whirlwind that I had to watch the submission deadline float by without any entry. The disappointment lingered, so I promised myself that 2024 would be my year—I would make something, no matter what.

Fast-forward to just three to five days before the new deadline, and my situation felt painfully familiar. I had nothing to submit. Zero. Zilch. My brainstorming sessions led nowhere, and I was worried I’d let myself down again. It was a classic case of procrastination meeting perfectionism, fueled by the desperation to produce something meaningful under a ticking clock.

## A Stroke of Inspiration

Then, in a stroke of inspiration, I recalled an open-source JavaScript tool that could convert the Roman alphabet into Balinese script. Because I’m Balinese myself, I’ve experienced firsthand how challenging it is to write in the Balinese script—especially since it was a mandatory subject throughout my school years. Seeing plain sentences transformed into accurate Balinese transliteration felt both practical and culturally significant.

Suddenly, it clicked: I could adapt this tool for my Swift Student Challenge submission. Its permissive license allowed me to integrate it into Swift Playgrounds using JavaScriptCore. I added extra features like mini-info on the script’s origins, structural nuances, and practice writing—users could use the transliterated output to practice writing the script. The app itself wasn't particularly flashy, but it was simple and functional, showing the vision to the judges in a short time.

What made this project stand out wasn’t just the technical execution but the context and storytelling behind it. By grounding the app in a personal use case—preserving a cultural script—it resonated with the judges on a deeper level.

Although I only had a handful of days left, I managed to put everything together in time—a feat that still feels a bit miraculous.

## Submitting "Learn Aksara Bali"

When I turned in "Learn Aksara Bali," I didn't think much of it. It was a simple idea that came from a place of near-panic. I just wanted to submit something, so my chances of winning weren't zero.

I remember thinking, "There's no way I'm winning this." A few weeks later, I got an email: I was a finalist in the Swift Student Challenge 2024! I didn't win the big prize of going to WWDC, but being a finalist was amazing. It showed that the best ideas don't need to be complicated; they just need a personal touch and a clear goal.

## Lessons Learned

### Simplicity Can Be Impactful

The biggest takeaway for me? Awesome ideas can come from anywhere – even from the fringes of your own cultural experiences. I almost dismissed my idea as too simple or boring, but it turned out the judges loved it! Knowing that an idea can be both straightforward and impactful is super liberating.

### Trust Your Gut

Instead of stressing over finding the “perfect” concept, I learned to trust my gut and follow my passions. Plus, the tight deadline forced me to focus on the essentials and avoid overcomplicating things. Perfectionism can be crippling. Sometimes, the best approach is to keep it simple, polish what you can, and ship it before you second-guess yourself.

## Advice for Future Competitors

### Highlight Context and Storytelling

One of the most powerful elements of any project is its context and the story behind it. Think about how your app fits into the bigger picture. Who does it help? What problem does it solve? Why does it matter to you personally? These details make your entry relatable and memorable. Judges aren’t just looking for technical execution; they want to see how your app impacts the world or connects to your experiences. Use storytelling to show the "why" behind your project and make it resonate on a deeper level.

### Find Your Passion

Thinking about joining the Swift Student Challenge or another competition? My advice: find something you're really passionate about! Dig into your own life, your culture, your experiences—use those as inspiration. Don't worry if your idea seems small; real innovation isn't always about fancy tech. It's about sharing your passion so others can connect and learn.

### Focus on Your Idea

You don't need to build the most complex app to win. Tech skills and a polished look are great, but the heart of your entry is your idea and how well you share it. Ideas are personal and unique. Find a concept that speaks to you and focus on explaining it clearly and with passion. Maybe it's using code to solve a problem you have or to help preserve something from your culture that matters to you. Be yourself and show your excitement for the project!

### Embrace Simplicity and Authenticity

Remember, your unique perspective and experiences are valuable. Don't underestimate the power of simplicity and sharing what you love. Embrace the challenge, trust your gut, and let your creativity shine. By tapping into your passions and presenting them clearly and engagingly, you might create something truly remarkable, even if it starts with a seemingly small or simple idea.

## Final Thoughts

I may not have walked away with the top prize, but being named a finalist showed me that taking a leap—even at the last minute—can lead to remarkable outcomes. A year ago, I was kicking myself for missing the deadline. Today, I’m sharing my story as a Swift Student Challenge finalist.

If there’s one takeaway from all of this, it’s that you should never underestimate the power of a simple idea with personal meaning. Embrace your curiosity, trust yourself, and remember that sometimes the best creations come from the simplest sparks of inspiration.
