Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 6, 2025

A Forbes story reports that cybersecurity skills are highly coveted, as the digital landscape faces unprecedented threats and skyrocketing costs associated with cybercrimes. By 2025, global cybercrime costs are projected to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion annually, according to a report by Cybercrime Magazine.

This surge in cybercrime is accompanied by a severe shortage of qualified professionals in the field. The cybersecurity job market is expected to grow by 33 percent between 2023 and 2033, with an estimated 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions worldwide by the end of 2025.

This talent gap is further exacerbated by the rapid evolution of cyber threats, with encrypted threats increasing by 92 percent in 2024 and malware rising by 30 percent in the first half of the same year.

According to Forbes, cybersecurity is one of the top 5 skills for job seekers to learn in 2025. The others are artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud computing, data analysis, and digital marketing.
