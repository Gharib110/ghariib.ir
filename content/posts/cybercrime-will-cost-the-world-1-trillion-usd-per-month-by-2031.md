###### _This week in cybersecurity from the editors at Cybercrime Magazine_

Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 31, 2025

The latest cybercrime damage cost predictions from Cybersecurity Ventures have been released at CybercrimeCost.com. For the first time, the figures are published in a chart (.pdf) with costs per year, month, week, hour, minute, and second, from 2015 to 2031.

The chart is designed to help reporters and journalists at media outlets to convey the past, present, and future of cybercrime for a certain time period. For instance, cybercrime will cost the world 1 trillion USD per month by 2031, up from around 1 trillion per year in 2020.

Cybercrime grew by 15 percent year-over-year from 2021 to 2025. The cybercrime growth rate from 2025 to 2031 is predicted to slow to 2.5 percent, similar to a large country GDP growth rate. Cybersecurity product innovation and maturity, AI tools, and other factors contribute to the slower cybercrime growth rate – which nonetheless remains one of the greatest threats to humanity.

“If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third largest economy, behind the U.S. and China,” says Steve Morgan, founder of Cybersecurity Ventures and Editor-in-Chief at Cybercrime Magazine.

Cybersecurity Ventures will follow up later in Q1 with supportive information around its cybercrime damage costs predictions.
