START LEARNING

# What’s a professional certificate?

LinkedIn Learning offers professional certificates from industry leaders, including Microsoft, Atlassian, GitHub, Adobe, and now JetBrains. Professional certificates make it easy to complete courses, take assessments, and share your credentials without leaving LinkedIn – great for making your profile stand out to recruiters.

With over 20 years of expertise in software development and the trust of 11.4 million developers, we can ensure you’re learning from the best. The Java Foundations Professional Certificate enhances your LinkedIn profile, validates your Java skills, and gives you real-world experience. You’ll work in IntelliJ IDEA, the industry’s leading IDE for Java development, gaining practical knowledge essential for your career.

# Why Java?

With 78% of Java developers choosing IntelliJ IDEA and over a million learners on JetBrains Academy, the Java Foundations Professional Certificate on LinkedIn Learning was a natural progression for us. But in a world buzzing with AI, why is learning Java still important?

**Java provides a strong foundation in programming concepts**. Learning Java makes it easier to dive into specialized fields like AI later. Our Computer Science Learning Curve Survey 2024, conducted among more than 23,000 learners, shows that most of them begin their journey with foundational languages like Java.

**Java remains one of the most widely used programming languages**. It powers industries from mobile development to large-scale enterprise solutions. Its demand continues to grow, offering stability and opportunities in your career path.

# What you’ll learn

The Java Foundations Professional Certificate consists of five courses that are designed to take you from zero experience to proficiency in Java. By the end of the series, you’ll have gained the skills required to apply for junior developer positions right on LinkedIn.

**Syntax and Structure**

Start your journey by learning how to install Java and IntelliJ IDEA and work with variables, data types, and key language components. You’ll also practice controlling program flow with conditional logic and loops, as well as using Java collections.

**Objects and APIs**

In this course, you’ll go through the fundamentals of objects and APIs in Java. You’ll learn about inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, and data structures, in addition to getting tips on handling exceptions, resolving errors, and preventing memory leaks.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

This course covers the fundamentals of OOP in Java to help you write secure, scalable, and maintainable code. You’ll find out how object-oriented principles are built into the language with classes, instances, and constructors to represent real-world objects.

**Data Structures**

Data structures are crucial for nearly all applications. This course covers essential data structures and their uses, as well as considerations like speed and performance. You’ll learn about arrays, their benefits and drawbacks, and how to use them effectively. The course also delves into Java Collections, emphasizing the Collection interface, which underlies most Java data structures.

**Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API**

Developers building mobile, web, or desktop apps often need to integrate relational databases. In this course, you’ll be introduced to the JDBC API and learn how to use it to manage data from databases like Postgres, Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server in Java applications.

We can’t wait to see you getting started with the Java Foundations Professional Certificate and taking your first steps on the path to becoming a developer. Make sure you let us know how you get on, and don’t forget to share your certificate and tag us on LinkedIn!
