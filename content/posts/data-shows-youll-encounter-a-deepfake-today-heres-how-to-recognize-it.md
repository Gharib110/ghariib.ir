The internet is brimming with content designed to entertain, inform—and sometimes deceive. The latest tool in a cybercriminal’s arsenal? Deepfakes. From fabricated celebrity endorsements to fraudulent job interviews, AI-generated deepfake scams are growing at an alarming rate. As deepfake technology becomes more advanced, it’s harder than ever to discern real from fake—until it’s too late. 

According to McAfee’s latest “State of the Scamiverse” report, deepfake scams have become an everyday reality. The average American now encounters 2.6 deepfake videos daily, with younger adults (18-24) seeing even more – about 3.5 per day. And for less than the cost of a latte and in under 10 minutes, scammers today can create shockingly convincing deepfake videos of anyone: your mom, your boss, or even your child.

At McAfee, we’re committed to helping users navigate this evolving threat landscape with cutting-edge protection tools. Understanding how deepfake scams work and how to safeguard yourself is the first step in staying ahead of cybercriminals. 

## **The Rising Threat of Deepfake Scams** 

Deepfake scams exploit the power of AI to create hyper-realistic audio, video, and images that can impersonate anyone—from politicians to CEOs, from family members to Hollywood stars. These fake videos and voices have been used to: 

- **Impersonate executives** to authorize fraudulent transactions, costing companies millions. 

- **Fabricate celebrity endorsements** to push scam investments, duping unsuspecting consumers. 

- **Mimic loved ones** in distress to manipulate people into sending money. 

- **Deceive job seekers** with fake interviews leading to identity theft. 

Our research shows that people encounter nearly three deepfakes a day online and that the number is growing, making the urgency to combat these scams greater than ever.

## **How Deepfake Scams Work** 

Deepfake scams typically follow a predictable pattern: 

1. **Gathering data:** Cybercriminals scrape social media, interviews, and publicly available footage to collect images and voice samples of their target. 
2. **AI manipulation:** Using deep learning algorithms, scammers create highly convincing synthetic videos or voice recordings. 
3. **Targeting victims:** The fabricated content is then deployed via phishing emails, social media, or direct messages to deceive unsuspecting victims. 
4. **Executing fraud:** Once trust is gained, scammers manipulate victims into financial transactions, sharing sensitive data, or clicking malicious links. 

## **Spotting a Deepfake Before It’s Too Late** 

While deepfake technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated, there are still ways to identify AI-generated deception: 

- **Unnatural facial movements:** Look for odd blinking patterns, stiff facial expressions, or lips that don’t sync properly with speech. 
- **Strange audio inconsistencies:** Pay attention to robotic-sounding voices, unnatural pauses, or a lack of breathing sounds. 
- **Inconsistencies in lighting and shadows:** Deepfake videos often struggle with realistic lighting, causing unnatural shading or misaligned shadows. 
- **Unusual requests:** If someone claiming to be a friend or executive asks for money or sensitive data, verify through another communication channel before taking action. 

## **Protecting Yourself from Deepfake Scams** 

To stay one step ahead of cybercriminals, consider these safety measures: 

- **Verify information from multiple sources:** Before believing a shocking video or message, check reputable news outlets or fact-checking sites like Snopes and PolitiFact. 
- **Be skeptical of unsolicited requests:** If someone claims to be a relative or executive needing urgent action, confirm their identity through a trusted method before complying. 
- **Secure your online presence:** Limit the personal data you share publicly to reduce the risk of scammers using your voice or image in deepfakes. 
- **Use strong cybersecurity tools:** Install **McAfee+ Total Protection** to safeguard your devices, identity, and privacy from emerging AI-driven threats. 

Deepfake scams are not just a futuristic concern—they are a real and present danger. Cybercriminals will continue refining their tactics, but with the right awareness and security tools, you can outsmart them.
