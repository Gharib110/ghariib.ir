title: "Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Avalanche Could Allow for Authentication Bypass"

Multiple Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Avalanche, the most severe of which could allow for authentication bypass. Ivanti Avalanche is a mobile device management system. Network security features allow one to manage wireless settings (including encryption and authentication) and apply those settings on a schedule throughout the network. Successful exploitation could allow for a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication. Depending on the privileges associated with the logged-on user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
