The pretty lights mean you're torturing your processor.

If you want to keep tabs on your Raspberry Pi's CPU usage, you can always use the built-in tools on your OS or download an app that can give you stats on how it's doing. However, where's the fun in that? Sometimes, the best use of a Raspberry Pi is to replicate what you could already do, but do it even cooler. Such is the case with this Raspberry Pi project that keeps an eye on how your Pi's CPU is doing and uses a light show to communicate how much load it's experiencing.
