ePrint Report: **Non Linearizable Entropic Operator**  
_Daniel Nager_

In \[Pan21\] a linearization attack is proposed in order to break the cryp- tosystem proposed in \[Gli21\]. We want to propose here a non-linearizable operator that disables this attack as this operator doesn't give raise to a quasigrup and doesn't obey the latin square property.
