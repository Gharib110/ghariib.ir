Comments are an important part of any programming languages that help users to understand about working of code block. Similar to other programming languages Python also allows us to add comments in our code. We can use single line comments or multiline comment for block of code. Assuming you have to comment out multiple adjacent lines in a file, then you can use multi-line comments in your Python application.

In this tutorial, you will learn about comment block of code in Python scripts. We can use triple quotes to comment out a block of code in Python. You can either use triple single-quotes `'''` or triple double-quotes `"""`.

## Comment Blocks in Python

To comment out a block of code in Python, you have two common options:

- **Add a # at the beginning of each line of the block:**  
    This method is useful for selectively commenting lines or when working with IDEs that allow you to toggle comments for selected lines easily.
- **Surround the block with triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`):**  
    This method turns the block into a multiline string. However, keep in mind that if the string is not assigned to a variable or used as a docstring, it effectively acts as a comment.

## Commenting Out Blocks of Code using Triple Quotes

Here’s a sample Python program demonstrating the use of triple-quoted strings (`'''` or `"""`) for comments. Triple-quoted strings can be used to add detailed, multi-line comments or documentation.

```python

# Sample program demonstrating triple-quoted string commenting

def greet_user(name):
    """
    This function takes a user's name as input
    and prints a greeting message.

    Parameters:
    name (str): The name of the user

    Returns:
    None
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the Python program.")

# Call the function
greet_user("Rahul")

"""
The program ends here.
Triple-quoted strings are useful for:
1. Writing multi-line comments.
2. Documenting functions, classes, and modules (docstrings).
"""
```

**Triple-quoted string for function documentation**: Inside the greet\_user function, a docstring (“”” or ”’) is used to describe the function’s purpose, parameters, and return value.

**Triple-quoted string as a general comment**: At the end of the program, a multi-line comment provides additional information about triple-quoted strings.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learn about commenting out block of code in Python programming language. Here you can use triple quotes to add comments.
