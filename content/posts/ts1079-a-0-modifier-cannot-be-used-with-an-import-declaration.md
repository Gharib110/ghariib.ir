# TS1079: A '{0}' modifier cannot be used with an import declaration

TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations to the language, helping developers to write more robust code. In TypeScript, types define the shape of data and serve as blueprints for variables, functions, classes, and more. Using types helps catch errors early in the development process by enabling better tooling, safer refactoring, and clearer documentation.

### What Are Types?

In programming, types define the categories of data and the operations that can be performed on them. Types can be primitive, like `number`, `string`, and `boolean`, or more complex, such as objects, arrays, and custom types defined using interfaces or type aliases. By enforcing types, TypeScript helps prevent type-related errors during compile time.

Now, let's dive into an important error message you'll encounter when working with TypeScript: **TS1079: A '{0}' modifier cannot be used with an import declaration**.

## Understanding TS1079: A '{0}' modifier cannot be used with an import declaration

The error **TS1079: A '{0}' modifier cannot be used with an import declaration** indicates that you're trying to use an accessibility modifier (like `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `readonly`) incorrectly within an import statement. In TypeScript, import declarations are used to bring in modules, but they do not allow for these modifiers as they are not valid within the context of an import.

### Code Example Causing the Error

Here's an example that would trigger the TS1079 error:  

```
// This will cause TS1079 error
import { public SomeInterface } from './some-module';
```

In this example, the use of the `public` modifier with the import statement is incorrect and causes the **TS1079: A '{0}' modifier cannot be used with an import declaration** error.

### How to Fix the Error

To resolve this, simply remove the accessibility modifier from the import declaration:  

```
// Correct import statement
import { SomeInterface } from './some-module';
```

Now the import is correctly structured, and you won't encounter the TS1079 error.

### Important Things to Know

- **Modifiers**: Modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected` are used in class properties and methods to specify visibility but are not applicable in import declarations.
- **Import Declarations**: These are used to include modules and should only specify the entities being imported without any modifiers.
- **Type Definitions**: Often, type definitions in TypeScript can come from imported modules, but ensure they are defined correctly.

### FAQs about TS1079

**Q1: What causes TS1079?**  
  
A1: TS1079 occurs when we use a class member modifier with an import statement, which is not valid syntax in TypeScript.

**Q2: Can I use modifiers in TypeScript?**  
  
A2: Yes, you can use modifiers, but only in class or interface declarations, not in import statements.

**Q3: How do I know if I'm using types correctly?**  
  
A3: Use TypeScript's strong typing features and pay attention to the error messages to catch mismatches or incorrect syntax.

In summary, **TS1079: A '{0}' modifier cannot be used with an import declaration** serves as a reminder that modifiers are restricted exclusively to class properties and methods. By understanding the proper scope and syntax of TypeScript's features, you can write cleaner, error-free code.
