This week I'm giving a little teaser as to what's coming with stealer logs in HIBP and in about 24 hours from the time of writing, you'll be able to see the whole thing in action. This has been a huge amount of work trawling through vast volumes of data and trying to make it usable by the masses, but I think what we're launchung tomorrow will be awesome. Along with a new feature around these stealer logs, we've also added a huge number of new passwords to Pwned Passwords not previously seen before. Now, for the first time ever, "fuckkangaroos" will be flagged by any websites using the service ðŸ˜® More awesome examples coming in tomorrow's blog post, stay tuned!

2. Publicly asking for a security contact ios really not something I want to be doing (it tends to be a last resort after not being able to raise the company via various other channels)
