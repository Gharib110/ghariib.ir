Hi Everyone,

We can hardly believe it, but VirusTotal is turning 20 on June 1st! As we sit down to write this, we’re filled with a mix of pride and gratitude. It's been an incredible journey, and we wouldn't be here without the amazing community that has supported us every step of the way.

When we started VirusTotal, our goal was simple: to help make the internet a safer place. We never imagined that two decades later, we'd be here celebrating this milestone with all of you. From the early days to now, it's always been about working together. Whether you're a user, a contributor, or a supporter, you've played a crucial role in our success.

Over the years, we've had the privilege of collaborating with some of the brightest minds in cybersecurity. We've received support and guidance from industry leaders who believed in our mission and helped us grow. To mark this special occasion, we reached out to a few of these key figures to share their thoughts and memories about VirusTotal. Their testimonials highlight the power of community and collaboration:

_"VirusTotal has consistently tackled tough challenges in cybersecurity. By assisting them with detailed analyses and organizing the first-ever VirusTotal training in Japan, I've seen their impact firsthand. Celebrating their integration into Google's parent company was a milestone. As VirusTotal marks 20 years, it's clear they've become essential for detecting malware and supporting cyber threat intelligence. Their contributions are invaluable to security personnel. I hope the younger generation continues this vital work, ensuring VirusTotal thrives for another 20 years."_

_"It’s difficult to think of a project that has had a greater impact on our industry than VirusTotal. I believe its success rests on three key pillars: providing easy access to top antivirus engines for users, enabling researchers to efficiently use YARA for pivoting, and the incredible dedication and passion of its team. On this 20th anniversary, happy birthday to VirusTotal and to everyone who has worked tirelessly to make this dream a reality! Cheers also to all who rely on VirusTotal daily for their work! Analizar, siempre!"_

We rely on it to track threat actors, connect the dots, uncover new undetected malware, quality test our detections, and discover related and still unnoticed threats. VirusTotal stands as one of the central pillars of the cybersecurity toolset, if not the most important one.”_
