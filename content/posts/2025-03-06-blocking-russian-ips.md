# Blocking Russian IPs

<br/>

<br/>
You might run some websites behind Nginx on Debian 12 and you might find yourself wanting to block requests from Russian IPs. It’s trivial. Here’s how to do it:

```
# apt install libnginx-mod-http-geoip
# echo "geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat;" > /etc/nginx/conf.d/geoip.conf
# cat << EOF > /etc/nginx/cc-block.conf
if ($geoip_country_code3 = "RUS") {
    rewrite / /block-russia;
}

location /block-russia {
    default_type text/plain;
    return 200 'Russian IPs are blocked here, due to your unjust and unprovoked War against Ukraine.';
}
EOF
```

Now for each of the vhosts in /etc/conf.d/sites-enabled/ that you want to block access for, just add “include cc-block.conf;” inside the server block. Then of course, do an “nginx -t” to test your config and a “service nginx reload” to load the changes.

You can test what your website looks like from different IPs using [https://geotargetly.com/geo-browse](https://geotargetly.com/geo-browse)
