      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth episode is dedicated to the most analyzed family of applications: communication and social networking apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I start, I would like to mention that I have made some corrections to the previous blog post, based on feedback by tool developers. Also, most of them have confirmed to me that they are working on improving their parsing capabilities, based on this blog series. I am happy to support them in that direction!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
