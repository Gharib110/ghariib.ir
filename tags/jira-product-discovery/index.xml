      <description>&lt;p&gt;Naturalist John Muir once said, “The mountains are calling, and I must go…” I could not agree more, John.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is something about the joy of tackling tough challenges.

In my personal journeys, there is no greater joy than realizing the payoff from all your hard work by reaching the summit – except perhaps in being able to share your joy with others who are on the journey with you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
