      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a reader wrote in and asked if I would look at Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, presumably to give thoughts on it from a privacy perspective. This was honestly the last thing I wanted to do, since life is short and this seemed like an obvious waste of it. Of course a project &lt;em&gt;devoted to literally scanning your eyeballs&lt;/em&gt; was up to some bad things, duh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However: the request got me curious. Against my better judgement, I decided to spend a few hours poking around Worldcoin’s documentation and code — in the hope of rooting out the obvious technical red flags that would lead to the true Bond-villain explanation of the whole thing. Because surely there had to be one. I mean: eyeball scanners. Right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
