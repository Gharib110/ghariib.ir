      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simple tips for fighting spam email.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hello, this is your distant relative from Nigeria. I’m writing because I have a terminal illness and no other living relatives. My dying wish is to transfer my inheritance of $100 million to you while I still can…”&lt;/em&gt; — we’ve all probably received an email like this at some point during our online existence. Originally known as “Nigerian prince” scams, today they bear the label “419” (after the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud). These days, however, instead of a “Nigerian prince”, you’re more likely to receive a letter from a fake employee of a bank, online store, or delivery service — or even… the President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attackers are distributing the Tria stealer under the guise of wedding invitations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting married is certainly one of the most important events in anyone’s life. And in many cultures, it’s customary to invite hundreds of guests to the celebration — including some you barely know. Cybervillains take advantage of such traditions, using wedding invitations as bait to launch attacks on Android smartphone users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what threat actors have come up with this time, and how to defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attacks on supply chains were one of the biggest threats in 2024. We discuss the most notable incidents of last year, and their consequences for the attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A supply-chain attack can totally thwart all a targeted company’s efforts to protect its infrastructure. Preventing such attacks is extremely difficult because a significant portion of an attack occurs in infrastructure that’s not within the security team’s control. This makes supply-chain attacks one of the most dangerous threats in recent years, and today we’ll look at some of the biggest that took place in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dangerous Banshee stealer for Macs has learned how to bypass built-in macOS security, and continues to evolve. How to protect yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many macOS users believe their operating system is immune to malware, so they don’t need to take extra security precautions. In reality, it’s far from the truth, and new threats keep popping up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-there-viruses-for-macos&#34;&gt;Are there viruses for macOS?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes — and plenty of ’em. Here are some examples of Mac malware we’ve previously covered on Kaspersky Daily and Securelist:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most high-profile ransomware incidents of 2024, and the consequences for targeted organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a slight drop in the amount of coverage of ransomware on our Kaspersky Daily blog in recent years. Sadly, it’s not that ransomware attacks have stopped. Far from it — such incidents are now so commonplace that they’ve become part of the cyber-furniture. Nevertheless, some ransomware attacks still have the power to shock. In this post, we take you through the ransomware incidents of 2024 that made a lasting impression in terms of scale, impact, or mode of attack…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SASE components: ZTNA, CASB CSWG, NGFW, SD-WAN, and how they improve network security&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The traditional network security model — with a secure perimeter and encrypted channels for external access to that perimeter — is coming apart at the seams. Cloud services and remote working have challenged the very notion of “perimeter”, while the primary method of accessing the perimeter — VPN — has in recent years become a prime attack vector for intruders. Many high-profile hacks began by exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN solutions: CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887 and CVE-2024-21893 in Ivanti Connect Secure, and CVE-2023-4966 in Citrix solutions. By compromising a VPN server, which needs to be accessible online, intruders gain privileged access to an enterprise’s internal network and plenty of scope for covert attack development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-remove-metadata-from-photos-videos-and-other-files-and-why-do-it-at-all-kaspersky-official-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metadata can reveal information that should remain confidential. We explain how to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me, you probably share plenty of photos, videos and documents, and send lots of voice messages and emails every single day too. But how often do you stop to consider the additional data contained in these files? For each of these files/media contains metadata — which can reveal a lot of interesting details not meant for prying eyes; for example, a photo’s time and location, a document’s editing history, device information, IP address, geolocation, and much more. So, for example, whenever you post an innocent selfie on social media, you’re also making public a whole ton of extra information that you might not necessarily want others to see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability CVE-2025-0411 in the 7-Zip file archiver allows bypassing the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability CVE-2025-0411 has been discovered in the popular 7-Zip file archiver software, allowing attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism. CVE-2025-0411 has a 7.0 CVSS rating. The vulnerability was quickly fixed, but since the program doesn’t have an automatic update mechanism, some users may still have a vulnerable version. That’s why we recommend immediately updating the archiver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who claimed quantum supremacy and decryption on quantum computers?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers remain a highly exotic technology, used by a very small number of companies for very specific computational tasks. But if you search for “quantum computer news”, you might get the impression that all the major IT players have already armed themselves with quantum technology, and that any day now hackers will start using it to crack encrypted communications and manipulate digital signatures. The reality is both less tense and more complex — but such nuances don’t make the headlines. So, who’s been making all the noise about quantum hacking?…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supply-chain attacks use trojanized legitimate Google Chrome extensions for data theft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right after Christmas, news broke of a multi-stage attack targeting developers of popular Chrome extensions. Ironically, the biggest-name target was a cybersecurity extension created by Cyberhaven — compromised just before the holidays (we’d previously warned about such risks). As the incident investigation unfolded, the list grew to include no fewer than 35 popular extensions, with a combined total of 2.5 million installations. The attackers’ goal was to steal data from the browsers of users who installed trojanized updates of these extensions. The focus of the campaign was on stealing credentials for Meta services to compromise business accounts and display ads at victims’ expense. However, that’s not the only data that malicious extensions can steal from browsers. We explain how the attack works, and what measures you can take to protect yourself against it at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to distinguish a fraudulent site from a real one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you’re asked to log in to an online service, verify your identity, or download a document through a link, you’re usually required to enter your username and password. This is so common that most of us do it automatically without thinking twice. However, scammers can trick you into giving them passwords for your email, government service websites, banking services, or social networks by mimicking the service’s login form on their own (third-party) website. Don’t fall for it: only the email service itself can ask to verify your email password — no one else! The same applies to government services, banks, and social networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to work with suppliers to reduce the risk of incidents related to supply-chain cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old saying, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link”, directly applies to enterprise cybersecurity. Businesses these days often rely on dozens or even hundreds of suppliers and contractors, who, in turn, use the services and products of yet more contractors and suppliers. And when these chains involve not raw materials but complex IT products, ensuring their security becomes significantly more challenging. This fact is exploited by attackers, who compromise a link in the chain to reach its end — their main target. Accordingly, it’s essential for business leaders and the heads of IT and information security to understand the risks of supply-chain attacks in order to manage them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/badram-attack-using-malicious-ram-module-kaspersky-official-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theoretical BadRAM attack on virtualization systems exploits a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from three European universities recently demonstrated the so-called BadRAM attack. This attack is made possible because of a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors, and primarily threatens cloud-solution providers and virtualization systems. In the worst-case scenario, the vulnerability could be used to compromise data from highly secure virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, implementing this scenario in practice would be quite difficult. The attack requires physical access to the server, plus the highest level of access to the software. Before discussing the BadRAM attack in detail, we should first understand the concept of a trusted execution environment (TEE).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not nice, you’d surely agree. But that’s the new reality for owners of vulnerable robot vacuums, which can be commanded by hackers to turn from domestic servants into foul-mouthed louts. And that’s not all: hackers can also control the robot remotely and access its live camera feed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, evasive malware exploits valid code-signing certificates to evade security measures and deploy Cobalt Strike and BitRAT payloads through compromised systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elastic Security experts have dubbed the binary “Blister,” with malware samples that have zero to negligible detections on VirusTotal. At the time of writing, the infection vector, as well as the ultimate objectives of the intrusion, are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; One remarkable aspect of the attacks is that they rely on a valid code signing certificate issued by Sectigo. The malware has been observed to be signed by the certificate in question dating back to September 15, 2021. The company said that Elastic reached out to it to ensure that abused certificates were revoked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
