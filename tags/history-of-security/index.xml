      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was created in 1973 by Peter Kirstein:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require a password.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I ran the service Â­ during which no security breach occurred over my link. I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government and British Post Office representation&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
