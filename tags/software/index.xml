      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-harmonize-agile-sprints-with-product-roadmaps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picture this: Product and Development teams are working in isolation. Product has created a 12-month roadmap and communicated it to internal stakeholders but didn&amp;rsquo;t review it with their development team. Dev starts building the features planned for the upcoming sprint without considering the broader product roadmap, leading to missed opportunities to optimize timing, like running projects in parallel, accounting for team capacity, or building reusable APIs that could serve multiple initiatives. The lack of coordination results in inefficiencies and delayed value delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;How to scan a full commit history to detect sensitive secrets&lt;/div&gt;</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-scan-a-full-commit-history-to-detect-sensitive-secrets/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-scan-a-full-commit-history-to-detect-sensitive-secrets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Secrets left exposed in outdated repositories pose significant risk for data breaches. For example, a still-active secret key can be exposed, leaving it vulnerable to exploitation. Secrets include access keys, API tokens, private keys, and other sensitive values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to use GitLab Secret Detection to scan a repository’s full commit history, including all branches, to detect sensitive secrets. In addition, you will discover how to view the results directly within the GitLab UI without the need for any integration. All it takes is just a couple of lines of code in your &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; pipeline file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Tutorial: Security scanning in air-gapped environments&lt;/div&gt;</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/tutorial-security-scanning-in-air-gapped-environments/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/tutorial-security-scanning-in-air-gapped-environments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Air-gapped environments are computer networks or systems that are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public internet or unsecured local area networks. This isolation is implemented as a security measure to protect sensitive data and critical systems from external cyber threats by providing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced security: By physically isolating systems from external networks, air-gapped environments help prevent remote attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized data access. This is crucial for highly sensitive data and critical systems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Data protection: Air-gapping provides the strongest protection against data exfiltration since there&amp;rsquo;s no direct connection that attackers could use to steal information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Critical infrastructure protection: For systems that control vital infrastructure (like power plants, water treatment facilities, or military systems), air-gapping helps prevent potentially catastrophic cyber attacks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compliance requirements: Many regulatory frameworks require air-gapping for certain types of sensitive data or critical systems, particularly in government, healthcare, and financial sectors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Malware protection: Without network connectivity, systems are protected from network-based malware infections and ransomware attacks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though air-gapped systems are isolated, they can still have vulnerabilities. Regular security scanning helps identify these weaknesses before they can be exploited. In this article, you will learn the different security scanners GitLab provides and how they can be added/updated in a limited-connectivity environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three open source experts offer their advice on sharing open source projects with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post 5 tips for promoting your open source project appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After months or years of hard work, you’ve just pushed your open source project to GitHub and made it public. Now it’s time to tell the world about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chances are you’d rather spend time writing code than getting the word out about your project. Maybe your project will go viral and you won’t have to spend much time on marketing. But chances are you’re going to need to do some work to build awareness, at least in the early days. Fortunately, there are plenty of people who have been down this path and are willing to help. In this article, experienced maintainers offer their advice on sharing open source projects with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of us might remember this 15-year-old Abstruse Goose comic about our choices in life. Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics – or as it’s often somewhat erroneously labeled – physics. […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/unnamed.png&#34; alt=&#34;Game Development vs Computer Science&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of us might remember this 15-year-old &lt;em&gt;Abstruse Goose&lt;/em&gt; comic about our choices in life. Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics – or as it’s often somewhat erroneously labeled – physics. Many years ago, I did a course on rigid body dynamics that was definitely a part of the theoretical mechanics curriculum, not physics! Then, you’ll probably also need a bit of materials science, optics, and a smattering of other subjects. The good news is you’ll have loads of fun along the way. And while you’re still learning, game development engines and libraries can help you keep on top of some of the accidental complexity and give you enough functionality to implement the things you want, albeit at a fairly basic level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing agent mode for GitHub Copilot in VS Code, announcing the general availability of Copilot Edits, and providing a first look at our SWE agent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post GitHub Copilot: The agent awakens appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we introduced GitHub Copilot back in 2021, we had a clear goal: to make developers’ lives easier with an AI pair programmer that helps them write better code. The name reflects our belief that artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t replacing the developer. Instead, it’s always on their side. And like any good first officer, Copilot can also fly by itself: for example, when providing pull request feedback, autofixing security vulnerabilities, or brainstorming on how to implement an issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine introducing a powerful new AI tool that boosts your team&amp;rsquo;s productivity — accelerating code development, resolving issues faster, and streamlining workflows. The excitement is palpable, but questions about security and compliance quickly arise. How do you manage the risk of AI inadvertently exposing sensitive data or responding to malicious prompts? This is where prompt guardrails play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prompt guardrails are structured safeguards – combining instructions, filters, and context boundaries – designed to guide AI models toward secure and reliable responses. Think of them as safety rails on a bridge, working to keep data and interactions on the correct path while supporting your organization&amp;rsquo;s security protocols. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how GitLab implements these guardrails, the risks they address, and their importance for security-conscious enterprises and compliance-focused teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming the backbone of modern software development, fueling developer efficiency and accelerating innovation. With the emergence of AI agents implementing code based on instructions from humans, we are learning that implementing AI-based features has its own unique set of security challenges. &lt;strong&gt;How do we protect access to the resources AI needs, protect confidentiality, and avoid privilege escalation&lt;/strong&gt;? Few organizations are ready to answer these questions today. At GitLab, we are. We are introducing a new paradigm for identity management: composite identities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/improve-security-auditing-with-gitlab-operational-container-scanning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conducting security scans is a regular part of any software development process. Whether scanning source code (e.g., Java, Python, or other languages), configuration files (e.g., YAML files), or container images, these scanning tools help development teams be proactive about understanding and addressing security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, developers run these security scans as part of CI/CD pipelines. By including these scans in CI/CD, every change to a project will be reviewed to see if any vulnerabilities are introduced. Understanding security concerns during development helps to assure that changes are addressed before they are deployed to a live environment, but there are many additional benefits to conducting container vulnerability scans post deployment as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Empowering humanitarian action with open source: A natural language search tool for UN Resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post 4 steps to building a natural language search tool appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have a problem. Our current search method for sifting through PDFs is extremely manual and time consuming. Is there an easier way?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a developer, this is one of those questions that really gets me excited. I was tasked with finding a way to transform a cumbersome, archival process into an efficient, intuitive search experience. It’s a way to make a group of people’s lives easier, and because of the organizations they work for, help them be more effective in providing humanitarian assistance to people in need around the world. I couldn’t imagine a better project to be working on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, they almost never venture into the Java C1 or C2 compilers and their resulting products – low-level assembly code. For the most part, the Java compilers are black boxes that typically remain closed under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You’ve encountered one if you’ve ever navigated through a repository’s file structure or reviewed a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/github-repo-browser.png?w=1024&amp;amp;resize=1024%2C653&#34; alt=&#34;Browsing files on Primer&amp;rsquo;s design repository. A tree view showing the repositories directory structure occupies a quarter of the screen. The other three quarters are taken up by the content of the content subdirectory. The tree view shows expanded and collapsed directories, as well as files nested at multiple levels of depth.&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;How-to: GitLab Single Sign-on with SAML, SCIM, and Azure’s Entra ID&lt;/div&gt;</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-gitlab-single-sign-on-with-saml-scim-and-azures-entra-id/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As organizations increase in size, it becomes increasingly difficult and critical to ensure that the right team members have access to the right groups and projects within their development platform. GitLab offers some powerful methods to manage user access, especially now with custom roles, but performing this at scale through a point-and-click user interface can be frustrating. However, all is not lost. You can use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) as a solution. (There are moments where I’m grateful for acronyms.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how specially crafted artifacts can be used to attack Maven repository managers. This post describes PoC exploits that can lead to pre-auth remote code execution and poisoning of the local artifacts in Sonatype Nexus and JFrog Artifactory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Attacks on Maven proxy repositories appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s been breaking the security of Java applications for many years, I was always curious about the supply chain attacks on Java libraries. In 2019, I accidentally discovered an arbitrary file read vulnerability on search.maven.org, a website that is closely tied to the Maven Central Repository. Maven Central is a place where most of the Java libraries are downloaded from and its security is paramount for all companies who develop in Java. If someone is able to infiltrate Maven Central and replace a popular library, they can get the key to the whole kingdom, as almost every large tech company uses Java.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Maybe it’s a sprawling COBOL system or an early version of C++ written back when “Y2K” was a serious concern. Now, decades later, you’re being asked to “look into it” and modernize it (while wondering if you need to send a note to that person who retired a few years ago and may know how this thing works).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Guide to fulfilling SOC 2 security requirements with GitLab&lt;/div&gt;</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/guide-to-fulfilling-soc-2-security-requirements-with-gitlab/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/guide-to-fulfilling-soc-2-security-requirements-with-gitlab/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For businesses that handle sensitive customer information, achieving SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) compliance is not just a good practice — it&amp;rsquo;s often a necessity. SOC 2 is a rigorous auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that assesses a service organization&amp;rsquo;s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While SOC 2 is not legally mandated, it has become increasingly important, in part due to breaches consistently seen in news headlines. Obtaining SOC 2 compliance allows customers to build trust with service organizations because they know their data is being properly stored and security controls have been assessed by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Introducing GitLab Advanced Vulnerability Tracking&lt;/div&gt;</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/introducing-gitlab-advanced-vulnerability-tracking/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/introducing-gitlab-advanced-vulnerability-tracking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DevSecOps streamlines software development by allowing teams to ship features quickly and providing short feedback cycles for customers. These short feedback cycles can be used to monitor the impact of a feature from the time it is shipped and to inform developers and product managers about the success or failure of a given deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GitLab, as an agnostic DevSecOps platform, can act as an integration point for different CI/CD tools that often contribute to user-facing functionality. For example, the vulnerability report, which displays all detected vulnerabilities, is visible as a single functionality, but the data in the report may come from a number of different tools in various pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pipeline execution policies are a newer addition to the GitLab DevSecOps platform and a powerful mechanism to enforce CI/CD jobs across applicable projects. They enable platform engineering or security teams to inject jobs into developers’ YAML pipeline definition files, guaranteeing that certain CI/CD jobs will execute no matter what a developer defines in their `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article will explain how to utilize pipeline execution policies to create guardrails around the stages or jobs that a developer can use in their pipeline definition. In regulated environments, this may be necessary to ensure developers adhere to a standard set of jobs or stages in their GitLab pipeline. Any job or stage that a developer adds to their pipeline that does not adhere to a corporate standard will cause the pipeline to fail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From the proprietary foundation models of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to the smaller, more open options from the likes of Meta and Mistral. It’s tempting to hop immediately to the latest models. But just because a model is newer doesn’t mean it will perform better for your use case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers play a critical role in ensuring banks remain competitive and compliant. One framework gaining significant attention is DORA. If you’re thinking of the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics, this is something different. The Digital Operational Resilience Act is a new regulatory framework focused on safeguarding financial institutions against digital disruptions. For developers, understanding DORA regulations is not just a regulatory necessity; it’s an opportunity to drive innovation and enhance the overall stability of their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some may refer to us being in the age of data. One of the essential aspects of handling such a large amount of data is &lt;strong&gt;anomaly detection&lt;/strong&gt; – processes that enable us to identify outliers, data that is outside the bounds of expectation and demonstrate behavior that is out of the norm. In scientific research, anomaly data points could be a cause of technical issues and may need to be discarded when drawing conclusions, or it could lead to new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to document and explain legacy code with GitHub Copilot with real-world examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Documenting and explaining legacy code with GitHub Copilot: Tips and examples appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why did the developer bring a flashlight to the legacy codebase? Because every time they tried to refactor it, they found more bugs hiding in the dark corners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, working with legacy code can also be bad—worse than that joke even! Whether you’ve inherited a decades-old codebase or are revisiting your own past work, working with a legacy codebase can be a time-consuming and overwhelming process—especially if there’s no documentation. Having well-documented code, legacy or otherwise, is critical for maintaining software quality and informing future development work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know? The Y2K bug, or “Millennium Bug,” was a programming issue caused by storing years with only two digits (e.g., “1999” as “99”) to save memory. As 2000 approached, systems risked interpreting “00” as 1900, leading to potential errors in calculations and data processing. Fears of disruptions in critical systems like banking and […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know?&lt;/strong&gt; The Y2K bug, or “Millennium Bug,” was a programming issue caused by storing years with only two digits (e.g., “1999” as “99”) to save memory.

      <title>Git security vulnerabilities announced</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/git-security-vulnerabilities-announced/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new set of Git releases were published to address a variety of security vulnerabilities. All users are encouraged to upgrade. Take a look at GitHub’s view of the latest round of releases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Git security vulnerabilities announced appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Git project released new versions to address a pair of security vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-50349 and CVE-2024-52006, that affect all prior versions of Git.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cve-2024-50349&#34;&gt;CVE-2024-50349&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Git needs to fill in credentials interactively without the use of a credential helper, it prints out the hostname and asks the user to fill in the appropriate username/password pair for that host. However, Git prints out the hostname after URL-decoding it. This allows an attacker to craft URLs containing ANSI escape sequences that may be used to construct an intentionally misleading prompt. The attacker may then tweak the prompt to trick a user into providing credentials for a different Git host back to the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Git project recently released Git 2.48.0. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few notable highlights from this release, which includes contributions from GitLab&amp;rsquo;s Git team and the wider Git community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;meson-build-system&#34;&gt;Meson build system&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Git could be built using either a Makefile-based build system or an Autoconf-based build system. Git developers have been using mostly the Makefile-based build system, so the Autoconf-based build system has lagged behind in features and maintenance. Another issue was that a lot of Windows developers use integrated development environments (IDEs) that don’t have good support for Makefile- and Autoconf-based build systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/gitlab-supports-banks-in-navigating-regulatory-challenges/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The risk of cyber attacks in the banking industry has reached unprecedented levels. Studies by the International Monetary Fund reveal that the financial sector is particularly vulnerable to cyber threats, with nearly one-fifth of reported incidents in the past two decades targeting this industry alone. As these threats continue to escalate, they drive the need for a regulatory response, prompting the banking and financial services industry to prepare for significant changes. GitLab enables financial institutions to proactively tackle these challenges, supporting banks on their regulatory journey while ensuring the operational resilience needed to protect the sensitive data pervasive throughout the banking ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced digital world, businesses need to adapt quickly to changing market demands. This has led to the rise of &lt;strong&gt;low-code development platforms&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;OutSystems&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Appian&lt;/strong&gt;, which are revolutionizing the way software is developed. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into why low-code development is the future of software engineering and how these platforms are shaping this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-low-code-development&#34;&gt;What is Low-Code Development?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Low-code development platforms allow developers to create applications through graphical user interfaces and configuration rather than traditional hand-coded programming. This approach drastically reduces the time and effort required to develop applications, making it accessible to both professional developers and business users with minimal coding experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Application Security teams face a constant uphill battle in risk reduction due to the ever-growing number of vulnerabilities. This year alone, 36,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) have been reported — a 25% increase from last year. The sharp rise intensifies the challenge of prioritization in vulnerability management, especially for lean AppSec teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help, we’ve introduced several new enhancements to our Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solution. These improvements are available for all GitLab Ultimate customers:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Data for learning has often already been cleaned and curated to allow you to learn quickly without needing to venture into the world of data cleaning, but real-world data has problems and is messy. Real-world data needs cleaning before it can give us useful insights, and that’s the subject of this blog post. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) has revolutionized how software teams create value for their users. Gone are the days of manual deployments and integration headaches — modern development demands automation, reliability, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At its core, CI/CD is about creating a seamless pipeline that takes code from a developer&amp;rsquo;s environment all the way to production and incorporates feedback in real time. CI helps teams catch issues early — before they become costly problems — by ensuring that code changes are frequently merged into a shared repository, automatically tested, and validated. CD extends this by automating the deployment process, making releases predictable and stress-free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Academic digital credentials — the cryptographically verifiable assertion that an individual holds a degree, certificate, or other credential — have been available for the better part of a decade. Yet despite the potential value of these data-rich, transportable credentials to graduates, employers, and academic institutions, digital credentials have by no means become the standard in presenting or verifying skills and qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A new report from the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), housed at MIT Open Learning, explores this gap between the promise of digital credentials and their widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://socprime.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-2024-49112-3-400x234.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, vulnerability exploitation accounted for 14% of breach entry points, marking a nearly threefold increase from the previous year—a trend that could persist into 2025. At the turn of January 2025, defenders released the first PoC exploit that can crash unpatched Windows Servers by leveraging a critical RCE vulnerability in the Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) tracked as CVE-2024-49112.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;detect-cve-2024-49112-exploitation-attempts&#34;&gt;Detect CVE-2024-49112 Exploitation Attempts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proactive vulnerability detection is expected to remain one of the top cybersecurity priorities in 2025. Security practitioners are increasingly seeking reliable sources of relevant detection content to identify potential threats in real time. The SOC Prime Platform addresses this need by providing the industry’s first CTI-enriched detection rule feed for both emerging and existing threats. Backed by a comprehensive product suite, the platform supports advanced threat detection, AI-powered detection engineering, and automated threat hunting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two months have seen the release of three new U.S. Government documents related to software security:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The National Cybersecurity Strategy released in early March covers the landscape of cybersecurity concerns and introduces the concept of shifting the liability for insecure software products and services from consumers to suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In mid-April, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and cybersecurity agencies of several other countries, released a paper titled “Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security-by-Design and -Default.”, which reinforced some aspects of the National Cybersecurity Strategy but also added additional requirements and expectations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And in late April, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CISA released a “Secure Software Development Attestation Form” that organizations that supply software to the government will be required to complete.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These documents could have a significant impact on the operations of software developers that sell to the government, both in the near term and for the foreseeable future. In this blog, we’ll review some key points of each and discuss their relationship to each other, to the US Presidential Executive Order 14028 released in May 2021 on improving the nation’s cybersecurity, and to the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF). Then we’ll provide some SAFECode comments on the relationship among the documents, and recommendations on the way that the government should use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Only a year ago, we saw the release of Scala 3.4.0-RC1, and now we’re trying out Scala 3.6.2 with many new experimental features. The last 12 months have brought many new features to the IntelliJ Scala Plugin as well. A year ago we introduced X-Ray mode, which lets you easily augment the code you see in the editor with information about inferred types and other details. We’ve improved Scala 3 support, compiler-based highlighting, and the debugger. We’ve improved auto-completion, both the standard and the AI-powered versions. We’ve introduced support for named tuples, which are still an experimental feature, and we’ve implemented a new way to work with sbt projects. On top of all that, this year, JetBrains joined the Scala Advisory Board. You can read about those changes in our release notes and other blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks, SAFECode has been discussing a number of government initiatives related to software security assurance. This is the first of several blogs that we will be publishing to share our perspective and recommendations for approaches that will help governments and other organizations gain confidence in the software that they acquire and use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the release of Executive Order (EO) 14028 in 2021, SAFECode has been tracking the U.S. Government’s plans and statements about how the portions of the EO dealing with secure software development and supply chain security would be put into action. This brief paper provides a SAFECode perspective on attestation that we believe will be important for software development organizations, end users, and government policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By leveraging the capabilities of &lt;strong&gt;ksqlDB&lt;/strong&gt;, you can deploy content rules and filter alerts directly within Kafka. This approach enables real-time filtration and aggregation of log event flows using an intuitive SQL-like language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-setup&#34;&gt;Environment Setup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our environment includes the following components:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Kafka Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;: A single-node Kafka cluster operating in KRaft mode (Kafka Raft Metadata mode). KRaft replaces the traditional ZooKeeper setup, simplifying Kafka’s architecture and improving operational efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kafka-UI&lt;/strong&gt;: A graphical user interface for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters. It allows easy visualization and manipulation of topics, schemas, and consumer groups.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ksqlDB Server&lt;/strong&gt;: This component enables real-time stream processing with SQL-like queries. It connects to the Kafka cluster, enabling filtering, transformation, and aggregation of streaming data.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ksqlDB CLI&lt;/strong&gt;: A command-line interface for interacting with the ksqlDB server. It allows users to write and execute SQL-like queries, define streams, and interact with data programmatically.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our TEST environment:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://socprime.com/wp-content/uploads/kafka-test-environment.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But, there&amp;rsquo;s often a moment when teams realize they need more. It could be when they land their first enterprise client, when they start handling sensitive data, or when they experience their first security incident.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure whether you’re ready to upgrade your security, here are a few signs you’ve outgrown your security needs:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As development teams grow, what once worked for a small team often becomes a bottleneck. Code standards become inconsistent, operational silos develop, and technical debt accumulates faster. What was a well-oiled machine is now dysfunctional as more team members, projects, and tools are added on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many teams experience these challenges as they grow, but how you handle and address these growing pains can save you time, energy, and money in the long run. In this article, we’ll explore the common pitfalls growing teams face and how successful organizations address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first part of our three-part series on test generation with GitLab Duo focused on how to automate code testing. Now, we will share the lessons we learned while using AI for test generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;situations-we-encountered-and-how-we-handled-them&#34;&gt;Situations we encountered and how we handled them&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we were pleased with the results using GitLab Duo to generate tests on our code. As is the case with any language generation, some cases required minor adjustments such as fixing import paths or editing contents in datasets. For the more complex cases, we had to remember that AI solutions often lack context. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we handled the more complex testing situations with GitLab Duo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This message from Sid Sijbrandij and Bill Staples was shared with GitLab team members earlier today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sid:&lt;/strong&gt; On today’s earnings call, I announced that I am stepping down as CEO and will remain Executive Chair of the Board. I also introduced GitLab’s new CEO, Bill Staples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a Board, we routinely do succession planning. This includes conversations with a number of top executives. We’ve been having these conversations in greater earnest since my cancer returned. Through these discussions, we identified someone uniquely qualified to lead GitLab. I want more time to focus on my cancer treatment and health. My treatments are going well, my cancer is not metastatic, and I&amp;rsquo;m working towards making a full recovery. Stepping down from a role that I love is not easy, but I believe that it is the right decision for GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-gitlab-empowers-translators-with-more-context/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitLab is continuously translated by our global community of translators and proofreaders. Through Crowdin, they help make our product more accessible to the world by translating it into 78 languages. GitLab translation community members are volunteer translators, working professionals who are GitLab users, and even university students contributing to translators as part of their classroom projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-the-gitlab-open-core-model-supports-translators&#34;&gt;How the GitLab open-core model supports translators&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this community collaboration is powerful, translators often face a crucial challenge: understanding the full context of the text that they are translating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;How to deploy a PHP app using GitLab&#39;s Cloud Run integration&lt;/div&gt;</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-deploy-a-php-app-using-gitlabs-cloud-run-integration/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-to-deploy-a-php-app-using-gitlabs-cloud-run-integration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing PHP application code and ensuring the application is running smoothly in production are often two different skills sets owned by two different engineers. GitLab aims to bridge the gap by enabling the engineer who has written the PHP application code to also deploy it into Google Cloud Platform with little effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you own event-driven, long-running services or deploy containerized jobs to process data, Google Cloud Run automatically scales your containers up and down from zero — this means you only pay when your code is running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Modernizing a simple C&#43;&#43; application to Java with GitLab Duo&lt;/div&gt;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Memory unsafe languages are those that do not handle any memory management on behalf of the developer. For example, when programming in C or C++, if you need memory during runtime, you will need to allocate and deallocate the memory yourself, running the risk of ending up with memory leaks in cases when you inadvertently forget to deallocate it. Other languages like Ada and FORTRAN provide some memory management but may not prevent memory leaks. Many organizations, including those in the public sector, have applications that have been developed using languages that are memory unsafe and are often looking to modernize these to a memory safe language, such as Java, Python, JavaScript, or Golang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 9 a.m. somewhere, and a DevOps engineer is starting their day. They check their GitLab todo list to see any mentions or tasks assigned to them, collaborating with other stakeholders in their organization. These tasks can include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;managing infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;maintaining the configuration of resources&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;maintaining CI/CD pipelines&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;automating processes for efficiency&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;maintaining monitoring and alerting systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ensuring applications are securely built and deployed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;modernizing applications with containerization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To carry out these tasks, DevOps engineers spend a lot of time reading documentation, writing configuration files, and searching for help in forums, issues boards, and blogs. Time is spent studying and understanding concepts, and how tools and technologies work. When they don&amp;rsquo;t work as expected, a lot more time is spent investigating why. New tools are released regularly to solve niche or existing problems differently, which introduces more things to learn and maintain context for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While manual code review processes may suffice for a small team, as DevSecOps teams scale, the processes create significant bottlenecks that impede software development velocity and quality. Often slow, inconsistent, and frequently failing to catch critical vulnerabilities, the manual approach leads to technical debt and increased security risks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To mitigate risks and drive innovation, organizations must prioritize automated code quality and compliance systems. The financial implications of poor code management are substantial, with technical debt consuming up to 40% of IT budgets (McKinsey Digital: Tech Debt Report) and software vulnerabilities costing an average of $4.88 million per security breach (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how GitHub Artifact Attestations can enhance your build security and help your organization achieve SLSA Level 3. This post breaks down the basics of SLSA, explains the importance of artifact attestations, and provides a step-by-step guide to securing your build process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Enhance build security and reach SLSA Level 3 with GitHub Artifact Attestations appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The need for software build security is more pressing than ever. High-profile software supply chain attacks like SolarWinds, MOVEit, 3CX, and Applied Materials have revealed just how vulnerable the software build process can be. As attackers exploit weaknesses in the build pipeline to inject their malicious components, traditional security measures—like scanning source code, securing production environments and source control allow lists—are no longer enough. To defend against these sophisticated threats, organizations must treat their build systems with the same level of care and security as their production environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We have some exciting news for ya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, backstory first: in case you missed it, OpenAI launched its o1-preview and o1-mini models back in September, optimized for advanced tasks like coding, science, and math. We brought them to our GitHub Copilot Chat and to GitHub Models so you could start playing with them right away, and y’all seemed to love it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We released a new open source byte-pair tokenizer that is faster and more flexible than popular alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post So many tokens, so little time: Introducing a faster, more flexible byte-pair tokenizer appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs), such as those used by GitHub Copilot, do not operate directly on bytes but on &lt;em&gt;tokens&lt;/em&gt;, which can complicate scaling. In this post, we explain how we solved that challenge at GitHub to support the growing number of Copilot users and features since the first launching Copilot two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll walk you through the vulnerabilities I uncovered in the GStreamer library and how I built a custom fuzzing generator to target MP4 files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Uncovering GStreamer secrets appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I’ll show the results of my recent security research on GStreamer, the open source multimedia framework at the core of GNOME’s multimedia functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ll also go through the approach I used to find some of the most elusive vulnerabilities, generating a custom input corpus from scratch to enhance fuzzing results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
