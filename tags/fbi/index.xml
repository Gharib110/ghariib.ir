      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to a DOJ press release, the FBI was able to delete the Chinese-used PlugX malware from “approximately 4,258 U.S.-based computers and networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To retrieve information from and send commands to the hacked machines, the malware connects to a command-and-control server that is operated by the hacking group. According to the FBI, at least 45,000 IP addresses in the US had back-and-forths with the command-and-control server since September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
