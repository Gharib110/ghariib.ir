      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of us might remember this 15-year-old Abstruse Goose comic about our choices in life. Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics ‚Äì or as it‚Äôs often somewhat erroneously labeled ‚Äì physics. [‚Ä¶]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/unnamed.png&#34; alt=&#34;Game Development vs Computer Science&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of us might remember this 15-year-old &lt;em&gt;Abstruse Goose&lt;/em&gt; comic about our choices in life. Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics ‚Äì or as it‚Äôs often somewhat erroneously labeled ‚Äì physics. Many years ago, I did a course on rigid body dynamics that was definitely a part of the theoretical mechanics curriculum, not physics! Then, you‚Äôll probably also need a bit of materials science, optics, and a smattering of other subjects. The good news is you‚Äôll have loads of fun along the way. And while you‚Äôre still learning, game development engines and libraries can help you keep on top of some of the accidental complexity and give you enough functionality to implement the things you want, albeit at a fairly basic level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We discuss the most notable incidents of last year, and their consequences for the attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A supply-chain attack can totally thwart all a targeted company‚Äôs efforts to protect its infrastructure. Preventing such attacks is extremely difficult because a significant portion of an attack occurs in infrastructure that‚Äôs not within the security team‚Äôs control. This makes supply-chain attacks one of the most dangerous threats in recent years, and today we‚Äôll look at some of the biggest that took place in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How to protect yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many macOS users believe their operating system is immune to malware, so they don‚Äôt need to take extra security precautions. In reality, it‚Äôs far from the truth, and new threats keep popping up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-there-viruses-for-macos&#34;&gt;Are there viruses for macOS?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes ‚Äî and plenty of ‚Äôem.

Sadly, it‚Äôs not that ransomware attacks have stopped. Far from it ‚Äî such incidents are now so commonplace that they‚Äôve become part of the cyber-furniture. Nevertheless, some ransomware attacks still have the power to shock. In this post, we take you through the ransomware incidents of 2024 that made a lasting impression in terms of scale, impact, or mode of attack‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SASE components: ZTNA, CASB CSWG, NGFW, SD-WAN, and how they improve network security&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The traditional network security model¬†‚Äî with a secure perimeter and encrypted channels for external access to that perimeter¬†‚Äî is coming apart at the seams. Cloud services and remote working have challenged the very notion of ‚Äúperimeter‚Äù, while the primary method of accessing the perimeter ‚Äî VPN ‚Äî has in recent years become a prime attack vector for intruders. Many high-profile hacks began by exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN solutions: CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887 and CVE-2024-21893 in Ivanti Connect Secure, and CVE-2023-4966 in Citrix solutions. By compromising a VPN server, which needs to be accessible online, intruders gain privileged access to an enterprise‚Äôs internal network and plenty of scope for covert attack development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metadata can reveal information that should remain confidential. We explain how to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre anything like me, you probably share plenty of photos, videos and documents, and send lots of voice messages and emails every single day too. But how often do you stop to consider the additional data contained in these files? For each of these files/media contains metadata ‚Äî which can reveal a lot of interesting details not meant for prying eyes; for example, a photo‚Äôs time and location, a document‚Äôs editing history, device information, IP address, geolocation, and much more. So, for example, whenever you post an innocent selfie on social media, you‚Äôre also making public a whole ton of extra information that you might not necessarily want others to see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supply-chain attacks use trojanized legitimate Google Chrome extensions for data theft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right after Christmas, news broke of a multi-stage attack targeting developers of popular Chrome extensions. Ironically, the biggest-name target was a cybersecurity extension created by Cyberhaven ‚Äî compromised just before the holidays (we‚Äôd previously warned about such risks). As the incident investigation unfolded, the list grew to include no fewer than 35 popular extensions, with a combined total of 2.5 million installations. The attackers‚Äô goal was to steal data from the browsers of users who installed trojanized updates of these extensions. The focus of the campaign was on stealing credentials for Meta services to compromise business accounts and display ads at victims‚Äô expense. However, that‚Äôs not the only data that malicious extensions can steal from browsers. We explain how the attack works, and what measures you can take to protect yourself against it at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to distinguish a fraudulent site from a real one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you‚Äôre asked to log in to an online service, verify your identity, or download a document through a link, you‚Äôre usually required to enter your username and password. This is so common that most of us do it automatically without thinking twice. However, scammers can trick you into giving them passwords for your email, government service websites, banking services, or social networks by mimicking the service‚Äôs login form on their own (third-party) website. Don‚Äôt fall for it: only the email service itself can ask to verify your email password ‚Äî no one else! The same applies to government services, banks, and social networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to work with suppliers to reduce the risk of incidents related to supply-chain cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old saying, ‚ÄúA chain is only as strong as its weakest link‚Äù, directly applies to enterprise cybersecurity. Businesses these days often rely on dozens or even hundreds of suppliers and contractors, who, in turn, use the services and products of yet more contractors and suppliers. And when these chains involve not raw materials but complex IT products, ensuring their security becomes significantly more challenging. This fact is exploited by attackers, who compromise a link in the chain to reach its end¬†‚Äî their main target. Accordingly, it‚Äôs essential for business leaders and the heads of IT and information security to understand the risks of supply-chain attacks in order to manage them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/badram-attack-using-malicious-ram-module-kaspersky-official-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theoretical BadRAM attack on virtualization systems exploits a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from three European universities recently demonstrated the so-called BadRAM attack. This attack is made possible because of a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors, and primarily threatens cloud-solution providers and virtualization systems. In the worst-case scenario, the vulnerability could be used to compromise data from highly secure virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, implementing this scenario in practice would be quite difficult. The attack requires physical access to the server, plus the highest level of access to the software. Before discussing the BadRAM attack in detail, we should first understand the concept of a trusted execution environment (TEE).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not nice, you‚Äôd surely agree. But that‚Äôs the new reality for owners of vulnerable robot vacuums, which can be commanded by hackers to turn from domestic servants into foul-mouthed louts. And that‚Äôs not all: hackers can also control the robot remotely and access its live camera feed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
