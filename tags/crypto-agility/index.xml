      <description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous blogs and articles are urging security professionals to start migrating to quantum-resistant algorithms immediately. This urgency was heightened on August 13, 2024, when NIST finalized the FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) standards. In this article, I present a simplified example of a client establishing a TLS 1.3 connection to […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Practical Advice for PQC Migration for TLS 1.3 appeared first on Security Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As quantum computing leapfrogs at great speed, the spotlight is now on post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Recently, NIST released the first three PQC encryption algorithm standards, urging organizations to test the new algorithms and prepare their cryptographic infrastructures for the inevitable shift to quantum-resistant methods. This push for PQC readiness is driven by a growing concern […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post What You Need to Know About “Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later” Attacks appeared first on Security Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
