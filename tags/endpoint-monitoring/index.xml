      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data is not just a strategic asset. It’s the lifeblood of your organization. Losing access to any strategic asset can threaten an organization’s viability; without plants and equipment, manufacturers would find it difficult to succeed, and service providers can’t operate without brand recognition. Similarly, without data, your organization could be left in a state of complete and utter paralysis, unable to function or recover. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like the security of other strategic assets, data loss prevention is not a reactive measure but a critical function that organizations must proactively address. By taking the initiative and implementing effective data loss prevention strategies, you can assert control over your data’s security and ensure the continuity of your operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some terminology in the cybersecurity world can be slightly confusing. One example is the difference between two similar terms: data leak and data breach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People sometimes use these terms interchangeably to describe situations where sensitive data is exposed. However, the difference between a data leak and a data breach is concrete in some ways. Knowing the difference between them helps organizations defend against either type of loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-a-data-leak-and-data-breach&#34;&gt;What is the Difference Between a Data Leak and Data Breach?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A data breach refers to unauthorized access or acquisition by an external party, often resulting from a cyberattack or security breach. A data leak is the accidental release or exposure of sensitive information due to internal errors or negligence. While a data breach is intentional, a data leak is typically accidental and can arise from various sources, such as misconfigured databases or human error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While external cyberattacks often make the headlines, internal security risks (aka insider risks) present a significant danger that is sometimes underestimated. These risks can arise from disgruntled employees, negligent insiders, or malicious actors with privileged access. The repercussions of such breaches can be severe, resulting in data loss, financial harm, legal fines, and harm to reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effectively managing internal security threats requires a careful and balanced approach. Implementing overly strict measures can hinder creativity and dampen current employee morale, yet having weak security protocols can leave organizations open to exploitation. This article delves into the various facets of internal threats, exploring the potential outcomes and examining the essential elements of a strong internal security plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
