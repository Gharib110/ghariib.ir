      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you just want to read the rules, you can find them&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;_._&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we held our inaugural Pwn2Own Automotive contest, and it was a rousing success. On our biggest-ever stage (literally), we awarded $1,323,750 over the three-day event as researchers from around the globe demonstrated 49 unique zero days. Today, we’re excited to announce that we will be returning to Tokyo and the Automotive World conference for Pwn2Own Automotive 2025. The event will be held on January 22-24, 2025, and we have some exciting challenges planned for our second year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Tesla Wall Connector is a Level 2 electric vehicle charge station designed for use by residential home users. The device has a minimal user interface in its hardware, providing a Wi-Fi based interface for configuration and an NFC reader for user authentication. The device does not come with a dedicated mobile application out of the box; the initial configuration—which is rather minimal—is performed via the web interface. After that, the device suggests the Tesla One app is to be used for further configuration. The Tesla app allows connecting to the device but apparently can only be used to perform a few functions such as scheduled charging and viewing information about the device. It does not offer options for further configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The WolfBox E40 is a Level 2 electric vehicle charge station designed for residential home use. Its hardware has a minimal user interface, providing a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface for configuration and an NFC reader for user authentication. Typical for this class of devices, the appliance employs a mobile application for the owner&amp;rsquo;s installation and regular operation of the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the moment of writing, the software versions were reported as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I recently presented my Exchange-related talk during OffensiveCon 2024. This series of 4 blog posts is meant to supplement the talk and provide additional technical details. You can read the first post in this series here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In part 2, I describe the &lt;code&gt;ApprovedApplicationCollection&lt;/code&gt; gadget, which was available for abuse because it did not appear on the deny list and could therefore be accessed via &lt;code&gt;MultiValuedProperty&lt;/code&gt;. I am also presenting a path traversal in the Windows utility &lt;code&gt;extrac32.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which allowed me to complete the chain for a full RCE in Exchange. For the moment, at least, Microsoft has made a decision not to fix this path traversal bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It allowed me to find 3 more vulnerabilities, even after the Exchange PowerShell attack surface had been significantly hardened by switching to a strict allow list of types. The vulnerabilities I found were:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Pwn2Own Automotive: More Autel Maxicharger Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/from-pwn2own-automotive-more-autel-maxicharger-vulnerabilities/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/from-pwn2own-automotive-more-autel-maxicharger-vulnerabilities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post highlights two additional vulnerabilities in the Autel Maxicharger that were exploited at Pwn2Own Automotive 2024. Details of the patches are also included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autel has been informed and has deployed a firmware update (v1.35) to address both of these issues. If you want to read about other Autel bugs reported at Pwn2Own, you check out our earlier blog here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Vulnerability: CVE-2024-23967 (ZDI-CAN-23230)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Computest Sector 7 identified and exploited a stack-based buffer overflow in v1.32 of the Autel firmware. This vulnerability stems from the decoding of base64 encoded data that can be controlled by an attacker. The encoded data is decoded into a fixed-size stack buffer with no bounds checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous Kenwood DMX958XR blog post, we detailed the internals of the Kenwood in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) head unit and provided annotated pictures of each PCB. In this post, we aim to outline the attack surface of the DMX958XR in the hopes of providing inspiration for vulnerability research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will cover the main supported technologies that present potential attack surfaces, such as USB, Bluetooth, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Kenwood apps, and more. We also provide a list of the open-source components the DMX958XR claims to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest, a total of four in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) head units have been selected as targets. One of these is the double DIN Kenwood DMX958XR. This unit offers a variety of functionality, such as wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, as well as USB media playback, wireless mirroring, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog post presents internal photos of the DMX958XR boards and highlights each of the interesting components. A hidden debugging interface is also detailed which can be leveraged to obtain a root shell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple Vulnerabilities in the Mazda In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) System</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-the-mazda-in-vehicle-infotainment-ivi-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Mazda Connect Connectivity Master Unit (CMU) system installed in multiple car models, such as the Mazda 3 model year 2014-2021. Like in so many cases, these vulnerabilities are caused by insufficient sanitization when handling attacker-supplied input. A physically present attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting a specially crafted USB device – such as an iPod or mass storage device – to the target system. Successful exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the final day of our first ever Pwn2Own Ireland. After three days of exploitation, we have awarded $993,625, so it seem likely we will pass the $1,000,000 mark. Still, there are no guarantees in Pwn2Own, so stay tuned for all the results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And we are done! Over the four days of the contest, we awarded $1,066,625 for over 70 0-day vulnerabilities. That makes four contests in a row that exceeded the million-dollar mark. Congratulations to the Viettel Cyber Security team for winning Master of Pwn with 33 points and $205,000. Our next event will be January 22-24, 2025 in Tokyo as we return for the second Pwn2Own Automotive. We hope to see you there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I spent some time researching a core SolarWinds product, SolarWinds Platform (previously Orion Platform). At that time, I hadn’t been aware of the SolarWinds Access Right Manager product (Solar Winds ARM).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative began receiving submissions of vulnerabilities in Access Rights Manager (ARM). The first submissions we received were from Sina Kheirkhah (@SinSinology), and one of those was a pre-auth RCE based on the .NET Remoting service. After his issues were patched, we received some additional, anonymous reports, in which pre-auth RCE was achieved via an unauthenticated gRPC/.NET Remoting based service on port 55555/tcp. An unauthenticated attacker was able to call its many methods, which were vulnerable mainly due to:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
