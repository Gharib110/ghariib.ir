      <title>Book Review: Red Team Blues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a rule, book reviews are not a thing I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when I received an out-of-the-blue email from Cory Doctorow last week asking if I would review his latest book, Red Team Blues, it took a minute to overcome my initial skepticism. While I’m a fan of Cory’s work, this is a narrow/nerdy blog about cryptography, not a place where we spend much time on literature. Moreover, my only previous attempt to review a popular cryptography novel — a quick sketch of Dan Brown’s abysmal &lt;em&gt;Digital Fortress&lt;/em&gt; — did not go very well for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DeepSec 2024 ended on 22 November 2024. We took a week off to post-process the event in terms of video material and dialogues. Usually only participants get first access to the video recordings, but because of the threat of disinformation from nation states, we published the keynote early and freely. Randahl Fink explained his take on manipulation of elections and entire societies. Russia, among others, is very proficient in creating election results that keep on surprising politicians and analysts alike. The Mind Bomb is real, and it is about to explode in Western democracies. You can watch the video online on Randahl’s YouTube channel, his Patreon site, or on our Vimeo account. Presenters at conferences are storytellers. They make topics come alive, create links between seemingly unrelated aspects, teach new knowledge, and hopefully make&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Extraction Agent and Firewall: Software vs. Hardware</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elcomsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/firewall_1200x630.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using a firewall is essential to secure the installation of the extraction agent when performing low-level extraction from a variety of iOS devices. We developed two solutions: a software-based firewall for macOS and a hardware-based firewall using a Raspberry Pi (or similar microcomputer) with our own custom firmware. This guide will help you choose the best option for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, let us clarify that the solutions described in this article are neither traditional nor fully-featured firewalls. Instead, they are designed to restrict internet access to specific endpoints during a critical phase of the sideloading process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI can assess a study’s novelty and impact various industries</title>

One such opportunity in scientific research is to create an objective method for evaluating the originality of research: an AI-powered tool for novelty scores. By assessing the novelty of studies, i.e. how surprising and innovative yet sensible these studies are, these scores enable industries such as pharmaceutical research &amp;amp; development to quickly identify and gauge areas for innovation more efficiently. This helps significantly speed up the traditional peer review processes. Professor Philipp Koellinger, Co-Founder and CEO of the preprint start-up DeSci Labs, explores how embracing AI in scientific publishing can accelerate progress and drive meaningful advancements across multiple industries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Ashton Kutcher and Secure Multi-Party Computation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in March I was fortunate to spend several days visiting Brussels, where I had a chance to attend a panel on “chat control“: the new content scanning regime being considered by the EU Commission. Among various requirements, this proposed legislation would mandate that &lt;em&gt;client-side scanning&lt;/em&gt; technology be incorporated into encrypted text messaging applications like Signal, WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. The scanning tech would examine private messages for certain types of illicit content, including child sexual abuse media (known as CSAM), along with a broad category of textual conversations that constitute “grooming behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PRFs, PRPs and other fantastic things</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/prfs-prps-and-other-fantastic-things/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I ran into a conversation on Twitter about the weaknesses of applied cryptography textbooks, and how they tend to spend way too much time lecturing people about Feistel networks and the boring details of AES. Some of the folks in this conversation suggested that instead of these things, we should be digging into more fundamental topics like “what is a pseudorandom function.” (I’d link to the thread itself, but today’s Twitter is basically a forgetting machine.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To Schnorr and beyond (part 2)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post continues a long, wonky discussion of Schnorr signature schemes and the Dilithium post-quantum signature. You may want to start with Part 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post I discussed the intuition behind Schnorr signatures, beginning with a high-level design rationale and ending with a concrete instantiation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: our discussion began with this Tweet by Chris Peikert:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/schnorrpeikert.png?w=1024&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which we eventually developed into an abstract version of the Schnorr protocol that uses Chris’s “magic boxes” to realize part of its functionality:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Luca Ginex&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post discusses CVE-2024-38193, a use-after-free vulnerability in the afd.sys Windows driver. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the Registered I/O extension for Windows sockets. The vulnerability was patched in the August 2024 Patch Tuesday. This post describes the exploitation process for the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, we give a general overview of the registered I/O extension for Winsock, describing the driver’s internal structures. We then analyze the vulnerability and proceed to detailing the exploitation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
