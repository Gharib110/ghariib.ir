      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some terminology in the cybersecurity world can be slightly confusing. One example is the difference between two similar terms: data leak and data breach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People sometimes use these terms interchangeably to describe situations where sensitive data is exposed. However, the difference between a data leak and a data breach is concrete in some ways. Knowing the difference between them helps organizations defend against either type of loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-a-data-leak-and-data-breach&#34;&gt;What is the Difference Between a Data Leak and Data Breach?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A data breach refers to unauthorized access or acquisition by an external party, often resulting from a cyberattack or security breach. A data leak is the accidental release or exposure of sensitive information due to internal errors or negligence. While a data breach is intentional, a data leak is typically accidental and can arise from various sources, such as misconfigured databases or human error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to insider threats and cybersecurity in general, experts often discuss how to practice policies of containment, and use these to mitigate threats. One fundamental way to do this is through the process of network segmentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-network-segmentation&#34;&gt;What is network segmentation?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Network segmentation means that you essentially create smaller subnetworks linked to each other, so that you structure your network better, for a few key benefits. First, it’s easier to see network activity and monitor it within these smaller systems. Second, it can enhance performance across the network. Third, it promotes the use of a zero trust strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
