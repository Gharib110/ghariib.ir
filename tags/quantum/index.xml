      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(April 19):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yilei Chen announced the discovery of a bug in the algorithm, which he does not know how to fix. This was independently discovered by Hongxun Wu and Thomas Vidick. At present, the paper does not provide a polynomial-time algorithm for solving LWE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a normal person — that is, a person who doesn’t obsessively follow the latest cryptography news — you probably missed last week’s cryptography bombshell. That news comes in the form of a new e-print authored by Yilei Chen, “Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems“, which has roiled the cryptography research community. The result is now being evaluated by experts in lattices and quantum algorithm design (&lt;em&gt;and to be clear, I am not one!&lt;/em&gt;) but if it holds up, it’s going to be quite a bad day/week/month/year for the applied cryptography community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
