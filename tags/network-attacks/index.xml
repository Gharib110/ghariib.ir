      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare reports thwarting the largest known HTTP-request distributed denial of service attack in history, approximately three times larger than any other previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The attack in July reached 17.2 million requests per second, the company wrote inÂ a blog post. For scale, the entirety of the Cloudflare network typically sees around 25 million requests per second in normal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While that is the largest attack the company has recently seen of the type, Patrick Donahue, product manager at Cloudflare, told SC Media that the botnet behind it has broken previously reported records several times in just the last month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
