      <title>Microsoft DevLabs Extensions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft DevLabs publisher was created as a hub for internal teams at Microsoft to channel their passion for Azure DevOps into experimental extensions. These extensions helped address product gaps and fostered innovation, ultimately benefiting Azure DevOps customers via the public marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/12/marketplace.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image marketplace&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, as the original creators of these extensions moved on to other things, many extensions became outdated. This led to several problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unresolved Issues and Questions&lt;/strong&gt;: Customer feedback and bug reports were left unaddressed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outdated Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;: Security and dependency updates were not maintained.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Frustration&lt;/strong&gt;: The resulting decline in extension quality negatively impacted the Azure DevOps experience as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To restore the value of the Microsoft DevLabs publisher, we conducted a review to identify which extensions should be actively maintained and which needed to be deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Misalignment between engineers and their leaders is possibly the leading cause of a sub-optimal developer experience and, consequently, poor productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See for yourself here&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we have moved on from a time when a positive developer experience meant buying a few ping-pong tables and ordering pizza on a Friday. Leaders understand that improving developer experience is about removing friction from the developer’s daily work and is a key input to productivity and retaining talent. But how closely do leadership attitudes match with what developers experience?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Boards Hub Rollout Expectations</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/new-boards-hub-rollout-expectations/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/new-boards-hub-rollout-expectations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the process may seem slow, we are steadily progressing toward rolling out the New Boards Hub to all customers. Our plan is to deprecate the old Boards experience for all Azure DevOps service users by the end Q1 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rollout is advancing on two fronts. First, we are setting the New Boards Hub as the default experience. Second, for customers who already have the New Boards Hub enabled as the default, we are transitioning groups to exclusively use the New Boards Hub. Removing the option to revert to the old Boards experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is critical to unleashing the potential of all teams, and we’re excited to use this revolutionary technology to improve the way teams work. A year ago, we launched Atlassian Intelligence to help teams boost productivity with AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve turned our attention to using AI to solve the highly complex problem of enterprise search and knowledge discovery. Our goal is to enable you to turn Atlassian and third-party data from across your organization into actionable insights and knowledge-driven decisions. In this age of generative AI, every team member deserves to have superpowers, and we want to make sure we deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
