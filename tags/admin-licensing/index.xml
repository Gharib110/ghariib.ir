      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has two very successful DevSecOps products in the market – GitHub and Azure DevOps. Azure DevOps has a large enterprise customer base that loves the highly customizable enterprise-focused planning and tracking capabilities in Azure Boards, the robust continuous delivery capabilities in Azure Pipelines, the manual and exploratory testing capabilities in Azure Test Plans, and the deep integrations across the suite. GitHub is the world’s largest developer community, with over 100M developers. It also serves over 4M organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 100. It’s beloved by developers and at the forefront of innovation with features like GitHub Copilot, which is transforming every aspect of the software development process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
