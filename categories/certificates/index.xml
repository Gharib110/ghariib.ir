      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla remains committed to fostering a secure, agile, and transparent Web PKI ecosystem. The new Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) v3.0, effective March 15, 2025, introduces critical updates to strengthen Certificate Authority (CA) practices and enhance compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A major focus of &lt;strong&gt;MRSP v3.0&lt;/strong&gt; is tackling the long-standing challenge of &lt;strong&gt;delayed certificate revocation&lt;/strong&gt;—an issue that has historically weakened the security and reliability of TLS certificate management. The updated policy establishes &lt;strong&gt;clearer revocation expectations, improved incident reporting, subscriber education by CAs, revocation planning,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automated certificate issuance&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that certificate replacement and revocation can be handled promptly and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the Mozilla Manifesto, which emphasizes the open development of policy that protects users’ privacy and security, we have worked with the Mozilla community over the past several months to improve the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) so that we can now announce version 2.8, effective June 1, 2022. These policy changes aim to improve the transparency of Certificate Authority (CA) operations and the certificates that they issue. A detailed comparison of the policy changes may be found here, and the significant policy changes that appear in this version are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
