      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when your devices are infected with a virus, it’s not as easy as a little bed rest for them to recover, and the damage can be long-lasting. A cyberattack can compromise your computers, phones and tablets, and open the door for cyber thieves to steal your sensitive personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering, there is a cyberattack approximately every 39 seconds. The most common form of cyberattack is malware, a type of software that’s used to break into your computer system. Last year alone, there were more than 6 billion malware attacks detected worldwide.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), a prominent national association for amateur radio enthusiasts, recently confirmed that it paid a staggering $1 million ransom to cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;arrl-hit-by-cyber-attack&#34;&gt;ARRL Hit by Cyber Attack&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARRL found itself at the mercy of a sophisticated ransomware attack. Upon realizing the severity of the attack, the ARRL was left with limited options. The decision to pay the $1 million ransom was not made lightly, but it was deemed necessary to regain access to critical data and ensure the organization’s continued operation. The move, while effective in recovering data, raises ethical and practical concerns about the long-term implications of complying with ransom demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/what-is-malware-and-its-types/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term “malicious software” is shortened to “malware.” Malware is invasive software that is purposefully created to harm computers and computer networks. On the other hand, software that unintentionally causes harm is typically called a software bug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, inquiries are made regarding the distinction between malware and viruses. The distinction is that ransomware, which encompasses various online threats such as viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware, is referred to as malware. To put it simply, one kind of malware is a computer virus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post titled &amp;ldquo;From Assistant to Analyst: The Power of Gemini 1.5 Pro for Malware Analysis&amp;rdquo;, published on the Google Cloud Security blog, we explore the capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro, which enhances malware analysis by processing up to 1 million tokens. This advancement allows the tool to analyze large amounts of disassembled or decompiled code in a single pass, providing a complete view of the malware&amp;rsquo;s logic to produce verdicts and summary reports. The blog post highlights practical applications of this approach, using well-known malware such as WannaCry and also entirely new and previously undetected malware. These examples show that Gemini 1.5 Pro&amp;rsquo;s reports are not based on pre-trained data of those specific samples but on its ability to analyze the code itself. For more details on how Gemini 1.5 Pro operates in malware analysis, we encourage you to read the complete post here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The COM Hijacking technique is often utilized by threat actors and various malware families to achieve both persistence and privilege escalation in target systems. It relies on manipulating Component Object Model (COM), exploiting the core architecture of Windows that enables communication between software components, by adding a new value on a specific registry key related to the COM object itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We studied the usage of this technique by different malware samples to pinpoint the most exploited COM objects in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Aleksandar Milenkoski (SentinelOne) and Jose Luis Sánchez Martínez&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VirusTotal stores a vast collection of files, URLs, domains, and IPs submitted by users worldwide. It features a variety of functionalities and integrates third-party detection engines and tools to analyze the maliciousness of submitted artifacts and gather relevant related information, such as file properties, domain registrars, and execution behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The VirusTotal dataset, the backbone of the platform, structures artifact-related information into objects and represents relevant relationships between them, providing contextual links between various artifacts. This makes VirusTotal a valuable resource for threat research, enabling users to perform activities such as clustering artifacts related to specific threat actors or campaigns, tracking malicious activities, and analyzing trends in the threat landscape. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Following MITRE&#39;s footsteps in analyzing malware behavior</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MITRE&lt;/strong&gt; framework helps all defenders speak the same language regarding attackers&amp;rsquo; modus operandi. VirusTotal provides multiple data points where MITRE&amp;rsquo;s Tactics and Techniques are dynamically extracted from samples when detonated in our sandboxes. In particular, samples&amp;rsquo; MITRE mapping can be found under the &lt;strong&gt;BEHAVIOR&lt;/strong&gt; tab of a file&amp;rsquo;s report. This data is searchable in &lt;strong&gt;VirusTotal Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; (VTI) with the help of a set of specific file search modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll illustrate how security analysts can leverage MITRE for malware detection and &lt;strong&gt;behavior&lt;/strong&gt;-based hunting for ransomware and keylogger samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this blogpost is part of our #VTMondays series, check out our collection of past publications here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many cyberattacks begin by victims visiting compromised websites that host malware or phishing scams, threat actors use domains for different malicious purposes as part of their infrastructure, and malware communicates with external sites for command and control and exfiltration. Detecting suspicious domains and preemptively feeding corporate security systems can disrupt attacks before they happen, with VT Intelligence being the perfect platform to early detect them and monitor malicious campaigns’ evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SMS services remain a critical part of telecommunications; they don&amp;rsquo;t require Internet access, and companies use them to inform their customers. This combination of features makes them incredibly useful for criminals who use the technology as a stepping stone in their never-ending campaigns. And if you think that the new RCS messaging standard will offer any protection, you would be wrong. These types of scams will continue to spread regardless of the messaging standard used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/tracking-threat-actors-using-images-and-artifacts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When tracking adversaries, we commonly focus on the malware they employ in the final stages of the kill chain and infrastructure, often overlooking samples used in the initial ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will explore some ideas to track adversary activity leveraging images and artifacts mostly used during delivery. We presented this approach at the FIRST CTI in Berlin and at Botconf in Nice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;hunting-early&#34;&gt;Hunting early&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In threat hunting and detection engineering activities, analysts typically focus heavily on the latter stages of the kill chain – from execution to actions on objectives (Figure 1). This is mainly because there is more information available about adversaries in these phases, and it&amp;rsquo;s easier to search for clues using endpoint detection and response (EDR), security information and event management (SIEM), and other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitdefender researchers investigated a series of incidents at high-level organizations in countries of the South China Sea region, all performed by the same  threat actor we track as Unfading Sea Haze. Based on the victimology and the cyber-attack’s aim, we believe the threat actor is aligned with China’s interests. As tensions in the region rise, they are reflected in the intensification of activity on behalf of the Unfading Sea Haze actor, which uses new and improved tools and TTPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VirusTotal has incorporated a powerful new tool to fight against malware: &lt;strong&gt;JA4 client fingerprinting&lt;/strong&gt;. This feature allows security researchers to track and identify malicious files based on the unique characteristics of their TLS client communications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ja4-a-more-robust-successor-to-ja3&#34;&gt;JA4: A More Robust Successor to JA3&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;JA4, developed by FoxIO, represents a significant advancement over the older JA3 fingerprinting method. JA3&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness had been hampered by the increasing use of TLS extension randomization in https clients, which made fingerprints less consistent. JA4 was specifically designed to be resilient to this randomization, resulting in more stable and reliable fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As we sit down to write this, we’re filled with a mix of pride and gratitude. It&amp;rsquo;s been an incredible journey, and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here without the amazing community that has supported us every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we started VirusTotal, our goal was simple: to help make the internet a safer place. We never imagined that two decades later, we&amp;rsquo;d be here celebrating this milestone with all of you. From the early days to now, it&amp;rsquo;s always been about working together.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Bitdefender, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly working on improving detection capabilities for our macOS cyber-security products; part of this effort involves revisiting old (or digging up new) samples from our malware zoo. During routine verifications, we were able to isolate multiple suspicious and undetected macOS disk image files surprisingly small for files of this kind (1.3 MB per file).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short look into the code revealed that these files are significantly similar to other samples analysed in the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>YARA is dead, long live YARA-X</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For over 15 years, YARA has been growing and evolving until it became an indispensable tool in every malware researcher&amp;rsquo;s toolbox. Throughout this time YARA has seen numerous updates, with new features added and countless bugs fixed. But today, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce the biggest change yet: a full rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;YARA-X is a completely new implementation of YARA in Rust, and it has the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better user experience&lt;/strong&gt;: The new command-line interface is more modern and colorful, and error reports are now more explicative. More features aimed at improving the user&amp;rsquo;s experience will be incorporated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
