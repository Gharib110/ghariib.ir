      <description>&lt;p&gt;The UK Home Office demanded Apple that it would backdoor its cloud encryption for all users in secret. Instead, Apple removed the cloud encryption only for UK users, and informed about this publicly. This is a serious warning to everyone concerned about privacy: It&amp;rsquo;s the first time one of the Five Eyes successfully pressured a company to remove their encryption for being able to pass on data to the authorities if requested. Given the increasing cyberthreats, this unprecedented move by Apple is shocking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp reigns supreme when it comes to free, popular chat apps. But alternatives like Signal are gaining traction because they are more private, more secure, and open source. If you want to quit WhatsApp for good and leave its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook), there are many messengers similar to WhatsApp for free and some make a great replacement not just in usability, but also in regards to privacy and security, and some even don&amp;rsquo;t ask for phone numbers. We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at ten best WhatsApp alternatives for iPhones and Android that focus on protecting your data, are easy to use, and have a decent number of users. Check out these encrypted messaging platforms, download your favorite and free yourself from big tech tracking!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Marc Ilunga Key derivation is essential in many cryptographic applications, including key exchange, key management, secure communications, and building robust cryptographic primitives. But it’s also easy to get wrong: although standard tools exist for different key derivation needs, our audits often uncover improper uses of these tools that could compromise key security.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On February 16, 2025, Google started rolling out a major shift in its tracking technology, planning to replace traditional third-party cookies with digital fingerprinting. While cookie-based tracking has long been controversial, this new method presents an even greater threat to your privacy - one that is nearly impossible to evade. But Google&amp;rsquo;s digital fingerprinting aimed at taking away your privacy with extensive tracking can be defeated!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta, we are deeply concerned about the proposed amendment to the so-called &amp;ldquo;Narcotrafic&amp;rdquo; law, which would force encrypted communication providers to implement backdoors for law enforcement. This would threaten everybody’s security and privacy and could be in conflict with European data protection legislation and Germany&amp;rsquo;s IT Security Act. We urge the French National Assembly to reject this dangerous amendment. A backdoor for the good guys only is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Implementing Cryptography in AI Systems</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/implementing-cryptography-in-ai-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting research: “How to Securely Implement Cryptography in Deep Neural Networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose “bits” are arbitrary real numbers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Excellent read. One example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of basic public key cryptography, in which a person’s public and private key are created together in a single operation. These two keys are entangled, not with quantum physics, but with math.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I create a virtual machine server in the Amazon cloud, I am prompted for an RSA public key that will be used to control access to the machine. Typically, I create the public and private keypair on my laptop and upload the public key to Amazon, which bakes my public key into the server’s administrator account. My laptop and that remove server are thus entangled, in that the only way to log into the server is using the key on my laptop. And because that administrator account can do anything to that server­—read the sensitivity data, hack the web server to install malware on people who visit its web pages, or anything else I might care to do­—the private key on my laptop represents a security risk for that server&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/three-questions-about-apple-encryption-and-the-u-k/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that the U.K. government had issued a secret order to Apple demanding that the company include a “backdoor” into the company’s end-to-end encrypted iCloud Backup feature. From the article:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The British government’s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. Its application would mark a significant defeat for tech companies in their decades-long battle to avoid being wielded as government tools against their users, the people said, speaking under the condition of anonymity to discuss legally and politically sensitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;New Outlook&#39;s security issues: Businesses should avoid switching!&lt;/div&gt;</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/new-outlooks-security-issues-businesses-should-avoid-switching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;new Outlook&amp;rdquo; (introduced in 2022) has been promoted as an upgrade, but its implementation introduces severe data protection concerns - so severe that it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say it&amp;rsquo;s a downgrade rather than an upgrade. Regardless, Microsoft increasingly pushes personal and business Outlook users to switch to the new Outlook. But IT admins should be warned: If employees press the toggle to switch to the new Outlook, they risk unintentional breaches of data protection laws, as all emails and login credentials are automatically stored on Microsoft’s cloud servers. This poses significant compliance issues, especially for businesses handling sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/what-is-a-tracking-pixel-how-to-stop-email-tracking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every click, swipe, or pause we make online is tracked, often through pixel tracking. This tracking is used by advertisers, big tech, and even political groups to monitor your email activity (often without you knowing). Also referred to as web beacons or tracking pixels, these embedded spies collect your personal data: such as your device type, your location, and interaction behavior with the email. Let’s take an in-depth look at what tracking pixels are, why they’re used, how to spot email trackers, and lastly how you can stop pixel tracking by using email providers with automatic tracking protection like Tuta Mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent Salt Typhoon cyberattack, orchestrated by Chinese attackers, finally gave US officials the much needed nudge to start endorsing strong end-to-end encryption, instead of wanting to undermine it! In this hack, the Chinese infiltrated major American telecommunications networks and, worst of all, they are still in the systems and can not be removed. For US officials, it wasn’t just another cyberattack; it was a wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/lets-talk-about-ai-and-end-to-end-encryption/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across a fantastic new paper by a group of NYU and Cornell researchers entitled “How to think about end-to-end encryption and AI.” I’m extremely grateful to see this paper, because while I don’t agree with &lt;em&gt;every single one&lt;/em&gt; of it’s conclusions, it’s a good first stab at an incredibly important set of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was particularly glad to see this paper, but this exact topic has been very much on my mind this past few months. On the one hand, my interest stems from the rapid deployment of new AI assistant systems like Google’s scam call protection and Apple Intelligence, both of which aim to put AI basically everywhere on your phone — even, potentially, right in the middle of your encrypted messages. On the other hand, it comes from a recent European debate over “mandatory content scanning” laws that would require AI to scan virtually every private message you send.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta our focus is to keep our users&amp;rsquo; data secure with quantum-safe encryption. To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords and the password length are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But given new threats of quantum computers, what is the optimal minimum password length recommended by NIST and CISA?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eight technologies developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, either wholly or in collaboration with researchers from other organizations, were among the winners of the 2020 R&amp;amp;D 100 Awards. Annually since 1963, these international R&amp;amp;D awards recognize 100 technologies that a panel of expert judges selects as the most revolutionary of the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Six of the laboratory’s winning technologies are software systems, a number of which take advantage of artificial intelligence techniques. The software technologies are solutions to difficulties inherent in analyzing large volumes of data and to problems in maintaining cybersecurity. Another technology is a process designed to assure secure fabrication of integrated circuits, and the eighth winner is an optical communications technology that may enable future space missions to transmit error-free data to Earth at significantly higher rates than currently possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta we are building a privacy-first alternative to big tech offerings so that everyone can protect their data online by sending encrypted emails and sharing encrypted events with Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar. This brings our service to the forefront of all kinds of adversaries. As a consequence, Tuta is regularly being attacked with DDoS attacks. While most of the times, we can fend off these attacks without you noticing, the adversaries changed their attack vectors beginning of December which led to several downtimes during the first week of December. We have now immensely improved our DDoS-protection methods and our systems are capable of fending off these attacks. Now, we would like explain what happened and how we mitigated the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areg Danagoulian, associate professor in the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, has built a career around nuclear detection technology. His work has focused, among other things, on a system that could greatly improve the current process for verifying compliance of nuclear warheads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier this year, he published new work on physical cryptographic nuclear warhead verification and on active detection of shielded nuclear materials in journals including&lt;/em&gt; Nature Communications &lt;em&gt;and the&lt;/em&gt; Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. &lt;em&gt;He has also received a pair of prestigious accolades: a radiation science and technology award from the American Nuclear Society and the honor of being named, along with his team, as the 2019 Arms Control Association (ACA) Arms Control Persons of the Year.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“This innovation paves the way for more effective arms control agreements, inspections, and enforcement,&amp;quot; said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the ACA. &amp;ldquo;Professor Danagoulian’s MIT team has brought the best science to arms control and provided a creative solution that can reduce nuclear threats and enhance security.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ron Rivest is an MIT Institute Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He’s an authority on algorithms and an inventor of the RSA public-key cryptosystem, one of the most widely used algorithms to securely transmit data. Since the 1980s, he’s taught students how to use cryptography to help secure voting systems. Then, in 2000, an historic recount in Florida determined the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, and the Caltech / MIT Voting Technology Project was founded with the mission to secure future elections, pulling in Rivest, who has been involved since, as well as other MIT faculty from the Department of Political Science and the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta we fight for your right to privacy with encryption. But the EU is still discussing policies and law enforcement demands that threaten to break encryption. If the EU continues down this path, we at Tuta are given two choices - compromise our quantum-safe encryption, or relocate to a region that values and safeguards digital privacy. The answer for us is easy. We&amp;rsquo;d rather leave the EU than break our open source encryption. Now we have signed an open letter and together with more than 50 organizations and companies we call on the EU to uphold strong encryption and privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Joe Doyle If you’ve encountered cryptography software, you’ve probably heard the advice to never use a nonce twice—in fact, that’s where the word nonce (number used once) comes from. Depending on the cryptography involved, a reused nonce can reveal encrypted messages, or even leak your secret key! But common knowledge may not cover every […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Friends don’t let friends reuse nonces appeared first on Security Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No one likes ads, but the free Gmail - a very popular email provider - continues to ignore its users demands at this crucial point. While seemingly the perfect email solution with lots of features and plenty of storage, Gmail shows more advertisements to its users than most email services. This advertising must be stopped!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1994, as Professor Peter Shor PhD ’85 tells it, internal seminars at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs were lively affairs. The audience of physicists was an active and inquisitive bunch, often pelting speakers with questions throughout their talks. Shor, who worked at Bell Labs at the time, remembers several occasions when a speaker couldn’t get past their third slide, as they attempted to address a rapid line of questioning before their time was up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/microsoft-is-adding-new-cryptography-algorithms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is updating SymCrypt, its core cryptographic library, with new quantum-secure algorithms. Microsoft’s details are here. From a news article:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first new algorithm Microsoft added to SymCrypt is called ML-KEM. Previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, ML-KEM is one of three post-quantum standards formalized last month by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The KEM in the new name is short for key encapsulation. KEMs can be used by two parties to negotiate a shared secret over a public channel. Shared secrets generated by a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic operations, which aren’t vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm when the keys are of a sufficient size&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strategic use of data is vital for progress in science, commerce, and even politics, but at the same time, citizens are demanding more responsible, respectful use of personal data. Internet users have never felt more helpless about how their data are being used: Surveys show that the vast majority of U.S. adults feel that they have little to no control over the data that the government and private companies collect about them. In response to these concerns, new privacy laws are being enacted in Europe, California, Virginia, and elsewhere around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Academic digital credentials — the cryptographically verifiable assertion that an individual holds a degree, certificate, or other credential — have been available for the better part of a decade. Yet despite the potential value of these data-rich, transportable credentials to graduates, employers, and academic institutions, digital credentials have by no means become the standard in presenting or verifying skills and qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A new report from the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), housed at MIT Open Learning, explores this gap between the promise of digital credentials and their widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This promise is based on a quantum factoring algorithm proposed in 1994 by Peter Shor, who is now a professor at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But do people today know the perfect password length?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese attackers have infiltrated more than a dozen US telecom providers such as AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile to monitor US officials, and even politicians like Trump and Harris. The FBI detected this attack by Salt Typhoon months ago, but still can not get the attackers out of the systems. Now, America&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Defence Agency (CISA) calls on everyone to use end-to-end encryption. This is proof that backdoors to encryption must never be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When using cryptography to protect data, protocol designers often prefer symmetric keys and algorithms for their speed and efficiency.

However, when data is exchanged across an untrusted network such as the internet, it becomes difficult to ensure that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the exchanging parties can know the same key. Asymmetric key pairs and algorithms help to solve this problem by allowing a public key to be shared over an untrusted network. And by using a key agreement scheme, two parties can use each other’s public key in combination with their own private key to each derive the same shared secret.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
