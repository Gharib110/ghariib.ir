      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla remains committed to fostering a secure, agile, and transparent Web PKI ecosystem. The new Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) v3.0, effective March 15, 2025, introduces critical updates to strengthen Certificate Authority (CA) practices and enhance compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A major focus of &lt;strong&gt;MRSP v3.0&lt;/strong&gt; is tackling the long-standing challenge of &lt;strong&gt;delayed certificate revocation&lt;/strong&gt;—an issue that has historically weakened the security and reliability of TLS certificate management. The updated policy establishes &lt;strong&gt;clearer revocation expectations, improved incident reporting, subscriber education by CAs, revocation planning,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automated certificate issuance&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that certificate replacement and revocation can be handled promptly and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In keeping with our commitment to the security and privacy of individuals on the internet, Mozilla is increasing our oversight and adding automation to our compliance-checking of publicly trusted intermediate CA certificates (“intermediate certificates”). This improvement in automation is important because intermediate certificates play a critical part in the web PKI (Public-Key Infrastructure). Intermediate CA keys directly sign server certificates, and we currently recognize nearly 3,000 intermediate certificates, which chain up to approximately 150 root CA certificates embedded as trust anchors in NSS and Firefox. More specifically, we are updating the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) and associated guidance, improving the public review of third-party intermediate certificates on the Mozilla dev-security-policy list, and enhancing automation in the Common CA Database (CCADB).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online security is constantly evolving, and thus we are excited to announce the publication of MRSP version 2.9, demonstrating that we are committed to keep up with the advancement of the web and further our commitment to a secure and trustworthy internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With each update to the &lt;strong&gt;Mozilla Root Store Policy&lt;/strong&gt; (MRSP), we aim to address emerging challenges and enhance the integrity and reliability of our root store. Version 2.9 introduces several noteworthy changes and refinements, and within this blog post we provide an overview of key updates to the MRSP and their implications for the broader online community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
