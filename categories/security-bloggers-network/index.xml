      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Marc Ilunga Key derivation is essential in many cryptographic applications, including key exchange, key management, secure communications, and building robust cryptographic primitives. But it’s also easy to get wrong: although standard tools exist for different key derivation needs, our audits often uncover improper uses of these tools that could compromise key security.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As organizations recognize the immense value and criticality of your data and systems, cybersecurity has become intrinsically linked to business strategy. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are increasingly expected to play a central role in shaping business decisions, assessing and mitigating risks, and ensuring that security strategies align with overall business objectives. This requires a […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post CISO Challenges for 2025: Overcoming Cybersecurity Complexities first appeared on Accutive Security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From smartphones to smart homes and even industrial applications, embedded systems are everywhere. But as these systems become more prevalent in our daily lives, the risks of cyber threats grow just as fast. That’s why it’s essential to build security into these embedded systems by design. And just as important as security itself is how […]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Hardware Cryptographic Accelerators to Enhance Security Without Slowing Down appeared first on Security Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Implementing Cryptography in AI Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting research: “How to Securely Implement Cryptography in Deep Neural Networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose “bits” are arbitrary real numbers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Excellent read. One example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of basic public key cryptography, in which a person’s public and private key are created together in a single operation. These two keys are entangled, not with quantum physics, but with math.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I create a virtual machine server in the Amazon cloud, I am prompted for an RSA public key that will be used to control access to the machine. Typically, I create the public and private keypair on my laptop and upload the public key to Amazon, which bakes my public key into the server’s administrator account. My laptop and that remove server are thus entangled, in that the only way to log into the server is using the key on my laptop. And because that administrator account can do anything to that server­—read the sensitivity data, hack the web server to install malware on people who visit its web pages, or anything else I might care to do­—the private key on my laptop represents a security risk for that server&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
