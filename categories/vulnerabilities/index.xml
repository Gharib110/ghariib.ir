While this feature significantly enhances security for end users, it simultaneously creates substantial obstacles for digital forensic experts, complicating lawful data extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-roadblock-to-logical-extraction&#34;&gt;A Roadblock to Logical Extraction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gaining access to data on Apple devices has historically been most feasible through standard mechanisms leveraged by many forensic tools, including iOS Forensic Toolkit, as part of an advanced logical extraction process. Alternative methods, such as low-level extraction, are either limited to older devices and iOS versions (currently, iOS 16.6.1 is the latest iOS build supported by iOS Forensic Toolkit) or legacy devices. Cloud-based analysis also presents challenges, as it requires full user credentials, and the device passcode is required on top of that to access end-to-end encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This attack involves the creation of highly convincing and professionally designed phishing web pages that impersonate well-known services. The attackers also utilize a compromised vendor to send phishing links within existing email correspondences, making the scam even more deceptive. How it Works: The attackers leverage Firebase to host phishing web pages that mimic legitimate services. By compromising a vendor’s email account, cyber criminals then insert phishing links into ongoing email threads. This tactic increases the likelihood of the recipient trusting the […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite a noticeable price hike, performance gains in this generation are minimal, with one notable exception: the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 significantly outperforms its predecessor in all key aspects. However, this GPU has also revealed a potential issue that could make its use in workstations running 24/7 problematic and potentially unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-connector&#34;&gt;The New Connector&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the root of the issue, let’s first understand how it arose. Modern GPUs require far more power than what can be delivered through the PCIe slot alone, forcing manufacturers to provide additional power via cables directly from the PSU. Antec, a well-known PSU manufacturer, has published a diagram illustrating the number of cables required to power high-performance graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This report includes two new metrics: SSE/SASE Threat Prevention and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs). Miercom’s independent, head-to-head stress testing establishes how well a platform can detect and block the latest generations of cyber security threats in real-world scenarios. Blocking at least 99% of cyber attacks is a key objective, because even a 90% block rate can translate to hundreds of costly attacks. Organizations subject to these attacks can face data loss, credential theft, ransomware demands, and […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting analysis:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project (source for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is yet another story of commercial spyware being used against journalists and civil society members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted and “possibly compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers, Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Each deployed security tool is designed to provide a specific type of protection across different areas like the network, endpoints, email, and cloud environments. This hybrid methodology, often requiring dozens of systems, leads to several security and operational challenges for security operations center (SOC) and network operations center (NOC) teams. Adopting a hybrid environment is unavoidable, and Gartner[1] anticipates that “By 2025, over 50% of network firewall deployments will involve more than two deployment factors from the same vendor — up from less than 10% in 2023.” [1]  While the benefits of this new ecosystem are […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MDR for MSPs: Navigating EDR compatibility</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/mdr-for-msps-navigating-edr-compatibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to endpoint detection and response (EDR) compatibility within an MDR offering, managed service providers (MSPs) are weighing two key priorities: native EDR integration or the flexibility to support multiple solutions. According to a recent OpenText survey, opinions are split almost evenly. While 52% of MSPs view native compatibility as moderately or very important, 48% place greater value on flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This divide reflects the unique demands MSPs face. On one hand, native compatibility ensures a tight integration. On the other, the ability to work seamlessly with various EDR tools is critical for MSPs managing diverse client environments. For MSPs managing a mix of EDR tools across their customer base, this adaptability can be the difference between a smooth operation and a logistical headache.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Further, according to Sprout Social, Facebook is the third-most visited website following Google and YouTube. Thus, when a phishing campaign leverages the Facebook brand, the implications are particularly consequential. Email researchers at Check Point have recently discovered a new Facebook-focused phishing campaign, which has been sent to more than 12,279 email addresses and targets hundreds of companies. The campaign began around December 20th 2024 and has primarily affected enterprises across the EU (45.5%), US (45.0%) and Australia (9.5%). Nonetheless, versions […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-passkeys&#34;&gt;What are passkeys?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may have seen the term “passkeys” appearing more frequently in tech news, app updates, and security discussions. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are rolling out passkeys as a replacement for passwords, promising both enhanced security and a smoother user experience. But what exactly are passkeys, and why are they considered the future of authentication?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Password Day coming up this Saturday, it’s the perfect time to discuss the future of authentication. Passwords have long been the foundation of online security, but they come with significant downsides: they can be stolen, guessed, or reused across multiple sites. Enter passkeys, a next-generation authentication technology designed to replace passwords entirely with a more secure and user-friendly alternative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the most significant aspects of this evolution is the increasingly sophisticated passcode protection system in iOS devices. This article explores how the delay between failed passcode attempts has evolved over time, highlighting changes that have made iOS screen lock protection more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-stages&#34;&gt;Early Stages&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of iOS, passcode attempts were practically unlimited. The delay between failed attempts would increase over time, but in extreme cases, the wait time could reach absurd numbers -sometimes even displaying “Next attempt in 100 million years.” There are plenty of screenshots of these exaggerated lockout periods available on the net.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The platform’s explosive growth is evident—its mobile app topped the iOS App Store charts within 48 hours of release, indicating unprecedented user adoption rates. While DeepSeek’s open-source model represents a breakthrough in cost-effective AI deployment, the DeepSeek consumer-facing app introduces substantial privacy and security challenges for enterprises. Most critically, the platform’s data collection practices extend far beyond typical usage data: according to DeepSeek’s privacy policy, all user interactions—including prompts, uploaded files, chat histories, voice inputs, images, and even keystroke patterns—are transmitted […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jen Easterly is out as the Director of CISA. Read her final interview:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I’m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I’m really proud of where we are, but there’s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A newly discovered VPN backdoor uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Oracle Database (Oracle DB) has reigned supreme in the competitive arena of database engine popularity ranking as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This pervasiveness has led Oracle Database to be trusted by Fortune 500 companies (e.g. Netflix, LinkedIn, eBay, etc.) to house, process, and safeguard their critical data. Its popularity can be attributed to its ability to handle massive volumes of data and concurrent transactions with high performance, making Oracle Database optimized for enterprise-level workloads, where speed, efficiency, and reliability are critical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And making a trip to Reykjavik. And Dublin. I talked about us considering this in the video yesterday, and just before publishing this post, we pulled the trigger and booked the tickets. The plan is to pretty much repeat the US and Canada trip we did in September and spend the time meeting up with some of the law enforcement agencies and various other organisations we&amp;rsquo;ve been working with over the years. As I say in the video, if you&amp;rsquo;re in one of these locations and are in a position to stand up a meetup or user group session, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you. Europe is a hell of a long way to go so we do want to make the most of the travel, stand by for more plans as they emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Like this guy yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/01/image-17.png&#34; alt=&#34;You Can&amp;rsquo;t Trust Hackers, and Other Data Breach Verification Tales&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my international friends, JB Hi-Fi is a massive electronics retailer down under &lt;em&gt;and they have my data!&lt;/em&gt; I mean by design because I&amp;rsquo;ve bought a bunch of stuff from them, so I was curious not just about my own data but because a breach of 12 million plus people would be massive in a country of not much more than double that. So, I dropped the guy a message and asked if he&amp;rsquo;d be willing to help me verify the incident by sharing my own record. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to post any public commentary about this incident until I had a reasonable degree of confidence it was legit, not given how much impact it could have in my very own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, LevelBlue conducted a comprehensive threat hunt targeting artifacts indicative of Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) activity across our monitored customer fleet. During the investigation, the LevelBlue Managed Detection and Response (MDR) Blue Team discovered a new PhaaS kit, now identified as RaccoonO365. The hunt confirmed true-positive compromises of Office 365 accounts, prompting swift customer notifications and guidance on remediation actions. The initial findings were handed over to the LevelBlue Labs Threat Intelligence team, which further uncovered additional infrastructure and deconstructed the kit’s JavaScript. This analysis provided critical insights into the features and capabilities of the emerging PhaaS kit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans make mistakes all the time. All of us do, every day, in tasks both new and routine. Some of our mistakes are minor and some are catastrophic. Mistakes can break trust with our friends, lose the confidence of our bosses, and sometimes be the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the millennia, we have created security systems to deal with the sorts of mistakes humans commonly make. These days, casinos rotate their dealers regularly, because they make mistakes if they do the same task for too long. Hospital personnel write on limbs before surgery so that doctors operate on the correct body part, and they count surgical instruments to make sure none were left inside the body. From copyediting to double-entry bookkeeping to appellate courts, we humans have gotten really good at correcting human mistakes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is writing law today. This has required no changes in legislative procedure or the rules of legislative bodies—all it takes is one legislator, or legislative assistant, to use generative AI in the process of drafting a bill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and legislatures around the world to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy research and analysis, and more.

Even with the new feature to include the domains an email address appears against in the logs, my concern was that I&amp;rsquo;d get a barrage of &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s useless information&amp;rdquo; messages like I normally do when I load stealer logs! Instead, the feedback was resoundingly positive. This week I&amp;rsquo;m talking more about the logic behind this, some of the challenges we faced with it and what we might see in the future. Stay tuned, because I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to be seeing a lot more of this in HIBP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, agile, and fast. For managed service providers (MSPs) supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with cybersecurity services, staying ahead of these adversaries is crucial. One of the most effective ways to do so is through round-the-clock threat hunting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore why constant threat hunting is essential, the challenges MSPs face in providing it, and how OpenText MDR can help overcome these challenges while offering SMBs the protection they need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/your-secure-boot-isnt-so-secure-new-cve-2024-7344-explained/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESET researchers recently disclosed &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-7344&lt;/strong&gt;, a critical vulnerability that compromises &lt;strong&gt;UEFI Secure Boot&lt;/strong&gt;, a cornerstone of firmware-level security for modern systems. This flaw affects a wide range of UEFI-based systems and enables the execution of untrusted code during the boot process, thus bypassing Secure Boot protections. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can deploy persistent and stealthy threats like &lt;strong&gt;Bootkits&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;Bootkitty&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BlackLotus&lt;/strong&gt;) even on devices with Secure Boot enabled, irrespective of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am always interested in new phishing tricks, and watching them spread across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I started getting phishing SMS messages with a new twist. They were standard messages about delayed packages or somesuch, with the goal of getting me to click on a link and entering some personal information into a website. But because they came from unknown phone numbers, the links did not work. So—this is the new bit—the messages said something like: “Please reply Y, then exit the text message, reopen the text message activation link, or copy the link to Safari browser to open it.”&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As more organizations adopt it and cloud-native software scales and becomes more complex, the need for container security is high. Kubernetes and container workloads have become a prime enterprise attack surface—67% of organizations delayed or slowed down deployment due to Kubernetes security concerns. There are numerous choices for container security. What sets Check Point CloudGuard apart? Its unique two-axes defense-in-depth approach scans, protects, and detects across an enterprise’s entire container environment. Think of it like this: one axis spans the software development lifecycle (SDLC), […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the web already supports HTTPS: In fact, 93% of requests made by Firefox are already HTTPS. As a reminder, HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) fixes the security shortcoming of HTTP by creating a secure and encrypted connection. Oftentimes, when web applications enable encryption with HTTPS on their servers, legacy content may still contain references using HTTP, even though that content would also be available over a secure and encrypted connection. When such a document gets loaded over HTTPS but subresources like images, audio and video are loaded using HTTP, it is referred to as “mixed content”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On April 13, 2022, 360Netlab first disclosed the &lt;code&gt;Fodcha&lt;/code&gt; botnet. After our article was published, Fodcha suffered a crackdown from the relevant authorities, and its authors quickly responded by leaving &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Netlab pls leave me alone I surrender&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in an updated sample.No surprise, Fodcha&amp;rsquo;s authors didn&amp;rsquo;t really stop updating after the fraudulent surrender, and soon a new version was released.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the new version, the authors of Fodcha redesigned the communication protocol and started to use &lt;code&gt;xxtea&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chacha20&lt;/code&gt; algorithms to encrypt sensitive resources and network communications to avoid detection at the file &amp;amp; traffic level; at the same time, a dual-C2 scheme with &lt;code&gt;OpenNIC domain&lt;/code&gt; as the primary C2 and &lt;code&gt;ICANN domain&lt;/code&gt; as the backup C2 was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, CNCERT and 360netlab worked together and discovered a rapidly spreading DDoS botnet on the Internet. The global infection looks fairly big as just in China there are more than 10,000 daily active bots (IPs) and alsomore than 100 DDoS victims beingtargeted on a daily basis. We named the botnet Fodcha because of its initial use of the C2 domain name folded.in and its use of the chacha algorithm to encrypt network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Emerging as a leading ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor, FunkSec made waves in December by publishing over 85 victim profiles on its Data Leak Site (DLS). However, beneath its apparent dominance lies a more complex and controversial story, as uncovered in Check Point Research’s (CPR) Global Threat Index for December 2024. FunkSec’s rapid ascent highlights the evolving tactics of RaaS operators. Utilizing artificial intelligence to scale operations, the group appears to rely heavily on AI-powered tools to generate ransomware and manage its double-extortion campaigns. While this […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Oct 21, 2022, 360Netlab&amp;rsquo;s honeypot system captured a suspicious ELF file &lt;code&gt;ee07a74d12c0bb3594965b51d0e45b6f&lt;/code&gt;, which propagated via F5 vulnerability with zero VT detection, our system observces that it communicates with IP &lt;code&gt;45.9.150.144&lt;/code&gt; using SSL with &lt;strong&gt;forged Kaspersky certificates&lt;/strong&gt;, this caught our attention. After further lookup, we confirmed that this sample was adapted from the leaked Hive project server source code from CIA. &lt;strong&gt;This is the first time we caught a variant of the CIA HIVE attack kit in the wild&lt;/strong&gt;, and we named it &lt;code&gt;xdr33&lt;/code&gt; based on its embedded Bot-side certificate &lt;code&gt;CN=xdr33&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In keeping with our commitment to the security and privacy of individuals on the internet, Mozilla is increasing our oversight and adding automation to our compliance-checking of publicly trusted intermediate CA certificates (“intermediate certificates”). This improvement in automation is important because intermediate certificates play a critical part in the web PKI (Public-Key Infrastructure). Intermediate CA keys directly sign server certificates, and we currently recognize nearly 3,000 intermediate certificates, which chain up to approximately 150 root CA certificates embedded as trust anchors in NSS and Firefox. More specifically, we are updating the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) and associated guidance, improving the public review of third-party intermediate certificates on the Mozilla dev-security-policy list, and enhancing automation in the Common CA Database (CCADB).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P2P networks are more scalable and robust than traditional C/S structures, and these advantages were recognized by the botnet authors early on and used in their botnets. In terms of time, Storm, which appeared in 2007, can be considered the progenitor of this area, when botnet threats were first known to the public. after Storm, there have been Karen, ZeroAccess, GameOver, Hijime, mozi and other kinds of P2P botnes, P2P botnets come and go, and some, for example, Mozi keep on going even though the author had been caught.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For decades users have been pressing Ctrl+C or relying on copy buttons. All these tricks and shortcuts to speed up text processing have become natural and intuitive to us. We do not pay attention to what is happening to copied information besides the fact that we can paste it. It’s safe to assume that most of us consider the clipboard as temporary data sharing. Once you copy something previous data in the clipboard will be overwritten. People rely on this assumption when they copy sensitive information such as passwords.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our daily botnet analysis work, it is common to encounter various loaders.Compared to other types of malware, loaders are unique in that they are mainly used to &amp;ldquo;promote&amp;rdquo;, i.e., download and run other malware on the infected machine. According to our observations, most loaders are proprietary and have a binding relationship with the family they are promoting. A few loader families make themselves into promotion platforms that can spread any other malware family, achieving the so-called malware-as-a-service (MaaS). Compared with proprietary loaders, MaaS types are obviously more dangerous and should be our primary target of concern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we believe in an open web that is safe to use. To that end, we improve and maintain the security of people using Firefox around the world. This includes a solid track record of responding to security bugs in the wild, especially with bug bounty programs such as Pwn2Own. As soon as we discover a critical security issue in Firefox, we plan and ship a rapid fix. This post describes how we recently fixed an exploit discovered at Pwn2Own in less than 21 hours, a success only made possible through the collaborative and well-coordinated efforts of a global cross-functional team of release and QA engineers, security experts, and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revocation Reason Codes for TLS Server Certificates</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/revocation-reason-codes-for-tls-server-certificates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our continued efforts to improve the security of the web PKI, we are taking a multi-pronged approach to tackling some long-existing problems with revocation of TLS server certificates. In addition to our ongoing CRLite work, we added new requirements to version 2.8 of Mozilla’s Root Store Policy that will enable Firefox to depend on revocation reason codes being used consistently, so they can be relied on when verifying the validity of certificates during TLS connections. We also added a new requirement that CA operators provide their full CRL URLs in the CCADB. This will enable Firefox to pre-load more complete certificate revocation data, eliminating dependency on the infrastructure of CAs during the certificate verification part of establishing TLS connections. The combination of these two new sets of requirements will further enable Firefox to enforce revocation checking of TLS server certificates, which makes TLS connections even more secure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered &lt;code&gt;ctypes&lt;/code&gt; and decided to use it to manipulate Python in a way I should not. The purpose was to see some of the &lt;em&gt;Python&amp;rsquo;s internals&lt;/em&gt; at work directly from the interpreter.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The article studies to the &lt;code&gt;CPython&lt;/code&gt; implementation of Python 2.7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-counting-and-the-garbage-collector&#34;&gt;Reference counting and the Garbage Collector&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing to know about Python is that its Garbage Collector uses reference counting. It means that every Python object has a &lt;em&gt;ref counter&lt;/em&gt; that knows how many references are pointing to the object.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Our first goal is to visualise that &lt;em&gt;ref counter&lt;/em&gt; for any object from the Python interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The goal of this article is to explain how to &lt;strong&gt;get reliable native code execution as a simple Python objet&lt;/strong&gt;. By reliable I mean: that, if our payload respect certain rules, we can call it multiple times from the same Python code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been looking at the Python&amp;rsquo;s execution model. I was curious about the implementation of some opcodes like &lt;code&gt;YIELD_VALUE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;YIELD_FROM&lt;/code&gt;, how were compiled list comprehensions, generator expressions and other fun Python features, and what happens at the bytecode level when exceptions were raised. Reading the &lt;code&gt;CPython&lt;/code&gt; code is really instructive, but I was feeling like something was missing to fully understand the bytecode execution and the stack evolution. Yeah, &lt;code&gt;GDB&lt;/code&gt; is cool but I&amp;rsquo;m a lazy guy who wanted a high-level interface and code some Python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, security professionals face many challenges in protecting their organizations from cyber threats. One common problem is the persistence of attack surface blind spots, which can be exploited by attackers and prevent an organization’s ability to stay ahead of threats. For businesses that lack the resources or budget for a full-time, in-house security operations center (SOC) or that struggle to recruit and retain skilled staff, these blind spots can be even more challenging to address. Here are three tips to eliminate attack surface blind spots and strengthen your security posture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest a total of 7 electric vehicle chargers have been selected. One of these is the Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial (MAXI US AC W12-L-4G) which also made an appearance at the inaugural Pwn2Own Automotive last January. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have previously posted internal photos of the MaxiCharger in 2023 so the goal of this blog post is to present up to date internal photos of the main boards and provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure this will matter in the end, but it’s a positive move:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a “hacking-as-a-service” scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company’s platform for AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was created in 1973 by Peter Kirstein:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require a password.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I ran the service ­ during which no security breach occurred over my link. I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government and British Post Office representation&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This has been a huge amount of work trawling through vast volumes of data and trying to make it usable by the masses, but I think what we&amp;rsquo;re launchung tomorrow will be awesome. Along with a new feature around these stealer logs, we&amp;rsquo;ve also added a huge number of new passwords to Pwned Passwords not previously seen before. Now, for the first time ever, &amp;ldquo;fuckkangaroos&amp;rdquo; will be flagged by any websites using the service 😮 More awesome examples coming in tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blog post, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why MSPs must offer 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response — and how OpenText MDR can help</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s cyber threat landscape, good enough is no longer good enough. Cyberattacks don’t clock out at 5 PM, and neither can your security strategy. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), offering customers 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response isn’t just a competitive advantage—it’s an essential service for business continuity, customer trust, and staying ahead of attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But delivering round-the-clock security coverage is easier said than done. It requires the right tools, expertise, and scale. This is why partnering with OpenText for offering managed detection and response (MDR) can help MSPs deliver on this critical need without overburdening their resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;News:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A sponge made of cotton and squid bone that has absorbed about 99.9% of microplastics in water samples in China could provide an elusive answer to ubiquitous microplastic pollution in water across the globe, a new report suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study tested the material in an irrigation ditch, a lake, seawater and a pond, where it removed up to 99.9% of plastic. It addressed 95%-98% of plastic after five cycles, which the authors say is remarkable reusability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Google’s Willow Quantum Chip and Its Potential Threat to Current Encryption Standards</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/googles-willow-quantum-chip-and-its-potential-threat-to-current-encryption-standards/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement of their Willow quantum processor marks a significant advancement in quantum computing technology while raising questions about the security and sustainability of current encryption methods. As quantum computers grow more powerful, cybersecurity experts grow increasingly concerned about their potential to break widely used encryption standards that protect sensitive data worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quantum-vs-traditional-computing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum vs. Traditional Computing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google’s Willow quantum processor is a leap forward in quantum computing capabilities, particularly in its approach to error correction and qubit stability. Unlike traditional computers that process information in bits (either 0s or 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states at the same time. Because of this, quantum computers can test millions of combinations simultaneously instead of one at a time. This fundamental difference allows quantum computers to solve certain types of problems exponentially faster than classical computers, including the mathematical problems that form the foundation of today&amp;rsquo;s encryption standards. When tested, Willow performed a standard computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years - a number that exceeds the age of the universe (Google).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming an organized crime tactic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Card draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display, open them in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and PINs or replace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the packaging, return to a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a customer unwittingly selects and loads money onto a tampered card, the criminal is able to access the card online and steal the balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As information security professionals, you play a crucial role in using the term “indicators of compromise” (IOC) to describe any malicious activity that may suggest a computer system has been compromised. Your expertise in identifying IoCs can help quickly determine when an attack has occurred and identify the perpetrators. Your insights can also help determine the extent and severity of an attack and aid in an incident’s forensic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This guide is not just a theoretical exploration of the top 10 indicators of compromise. It’s a practical tool that can empower your security team to develop effective incident response plans and safeguard your valuable data and assets.

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/10-steps-to-safeguarding-your-privacy-online/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more devices, digital apps and online accounts you use, the more efficient and convenient your life becomes. But all that ease of use comes with a price. Your devices are constantly collecting your personal data to fine-tune your user experience. At the same time, hackers, and other cyber criminals are working round the clock to steal this sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of your digital identity as a confidential file full of high-value information – passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, social security numbers and more. If you’re not taking the proper steps to guard your online privacy, you could end up handing over the files to a vast army of cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>20 Causes of Data Loss Threatening Businesses in 2025</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/20-causes-of-data-loss-threatening-businesses-in-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data is not just a strategic asset. It’s the lifeblood of your organization. Losing access to any strategic asset can threaten an organization’s viability; without plants and equipment, manufacturers would find it difficult to succeed, and service providers can’t operate without brand recognition. Similarly, without data, your organization could be left in a state of complete and utter paralysis, unable to function or recover. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like the security of other strategic assets, data loss prevention is not a reactive measure but a critical function that organizations must proactively address. By taking the initiative and implementing effective data loss prevention strategies, you can assert control over your data’s security and ensure the continuity of your operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs associated with insider threats continued to rise in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is bad news for organizations that are already under financial pressure from the uncertainty of the economy. As interest rates continue to climb and customers become more conservative about how they spend, the last thing that any organization needs is to be putting out fires from security incidents coming from arsonists inside their own house.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, a variety of factors, not the least of which are sizable layoffs hitting companies and the fluidity of access to data, make the possibility of an insider threat increasingly likely. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/6-reasons-why-smbs-love-opentext-mdr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital-first world, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face cybersecurity challenges that grow more complex by the day. SMBs are prime targets for attackers hoping to gain a foothold inside any organization that doesn’t have extensive security measures. As threats increase, so does the need for comprehensive, reliable, and accessible protection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where managed detection and response (MDR) services come in. MDR combines threat detection, investigation, and response, offering businesses the support from a team of security experts who monitor the environment 24/7 to identify and respond to threats. For many SMBs, MDR is an ideal solution because it provides a level of protection and expertise that would otherwise require building an in-house security operations center (SOC).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when your devices are infected with a virus, it’s not as easy as a little bed rest for them to recover, and the damage can be long-lasting. A cyberattack can compromise your computers, phones and tablets, and open the door for cyber thieves to steal your sensitive personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering, there is a cyberattack approximately every 39 seconds. The most common form of cyberattack is malware, a type of software that’s used to break into your computer system. Last year alone, there were more than 6 billion malware attacks detected worldwide. Some of the many forms of malware include:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the apps on our smartphones to chatbot assistant services, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our lives in both big and small ways. But as exciting as AI can be, it’s also important to understand its potential risks. October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, making it the perfect time to become more cyber-savvy about AI. Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ai&#34;&gt;What is AI?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI is a technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. In everyday life, AI is behind many of the technologies we use. It powers recommendations on streaming TV services like Netflix, improves photo quality on your smartphone, and even aids in driving cars. AI is like having a smart assistant that can process information quickly, automate daily tasks, and make technology more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), a prominent national association for amateur radio enthusiasts, recently confirmed that it paid a staggering $1 million ransom to cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;arrl-hit-by-cyber-attack&#34;&gt;ARRL Hit by Cyber Attack&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARRL found itself at the mercy of a sophisticated ransomware attack. Upon realizing the severity of the attack, the ARRL was left with limited options. The decision to pay the $1 million ransom was not made lightly, but it was deemed necessary to regain access to critical data and ensure the organization’s continued operation. The move, while effective in recovering data, raises ethical and practical concerns about the long-term implications of complying with ransom demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the final quarter of 2022, the infostealer malware, Rhadamanthys, was found. Given that it could target browser extensions and wallet clients installed on the victim’s computer, its capabilities demonstrated a particular interest in cryptocurrency wallets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary means of distribution for this threat that have been noticed are phishing emails and phony software websites that are advertised through Google Ads, regardless of the vertical or region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although its distribution and information theft methods have been observed previously, its downloader component makes it stand out. It analyzes by conventional security methods extremely difficult by combining sophisticated anti-analysis techniques with heavy obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Breach Versus Data Leak: What’s The Difference?</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/data-breach-versus-data-leak-whats-the-difference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some terminology in the cybersecurity world can be slightly confusing. One example is the difference between two similar terms: data leak and data breach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People sometimes use these terms interchangeably to describe situations where sensitive data is exposed. However, the difference between a data leak and a data breach is concrete in some ways. Knowing the difference between them helps organizations defend against either type of loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-a-data-leak-and-data-breach&#34;&gt;What is the Difference Between a Data Leak and Data Breach?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A data breach refers to unauthorized access or acquisition by an external party, often resulting from a cyberattack or security breach. A data leak is the accidental release or exposure of sensitive information due to internal errors or negligence. While a data breach is intentional, a data leak is typically accidental and can arise from various sources, such as misconfigured databases or human error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rise of online scams and privacy risks, virtual private networks (VPNs) are becoming more popular for day-to-day use. Or at least I feel like they are based on the number of ads I hear for them on my favorite podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So maybe you’ve heard of VPNs but aren’t actually sure what they are. Simply put, a VPN creates a safe, anonymous pathway for the data you send and receive over a Wi-Fi network, allowing you to browse anonymously and access content as if you were in a different location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming increasingly challenging to secure sensitive data. Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, IT infrastructure is becoming more complex, and attack surfaces are increasing. With so much data now stored off-premises, organizations must protect not only their sensitive information but also the platforms that house it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where data security posture management (DPSM) and cloud security posture management (CPSM) come in. Both technologies play critical roles in cloud data security and can be easily confused at first glance. So, let’s explore their key differences and their role in data protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The latest data underscores that the trade-offs are significant and pose substantial risks to US SLED providers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get the report&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the foremost obstacles is the disconnect between senior executives and cybersecurity priorities. Despite recognizing cyber resilience as a crucial imperative, many US SLED organizations struggle to secure the support and resources from top leadership. This lack of engagement hinders progress and leaves institutions vulnerable to potential breaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/handling-internal-security-threats-a-balanced-approach/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/handling-internal-security-threats-a-balanced-approach/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While external cyberattacks often make the headlines, internal security risks (aka insider risks) present a significant danger that is sometimes underestimated. These risks can arise from disgruntled employees, negligent insiders, or malicious actors with privileged access. The repercussions of such breaches can be severe, resulting in data loss, financial harm, legal fines, and harm to reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effectively managing internal security threats requires a careful and balanced approach. Implementing overly strict measures can hinder creativity and dampen current employee morale, yet having weak security protocols can leave organizations open to exploitation. This article delves into the various facets of internal threats, exploring the potential outcomes and examining the essential elements of a strong internal security plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Security leaders continue to be under intense pressure. Increasingly, they are turning toward third parties for support and expertise as their cybersecurity woes become more dire and it becomes harder to recruit and retain talent.  This is reflected in the projected growth for cybersecurity services through 20281 (managed security services, managed detection and response, security consulting, and security professional services).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Gartner1, end-user spending for all security services will grow from $77.4 billion in 2024 to $116.9 billion in 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 percent. Managed detection and response (MDR) is forecasted to be the highest growth area of security services, with a projected 17.1 percent CAGR through 2028. This is in part due to the continued, acute need for support with threat monitoring, detection, and response. However, it’s also due to a growing need for help with risk identification, management and governance, exposure and vulnerability management, and incident readiness due to increasingly stringent requirements by regulators for reporting in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steam the Webinar on demand HERE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we look back on the cybersecurity landscape of 2024, it’s clear that the world of digital threats continues to evolve at an alarming pace in parallel with AI. This year has seen ransomware groups adapt and innovate, pushing the boundaries of their malicious capabilities and evasiveness from law enforcement. In our annual “Nastiest Malware” report, now in its sixth year, we’ve observed a steady increase in both the number and sophistication of malware attacks. The ransomware sector, in particular, has witnessed the emergence of “business models,” with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) dominating the scene. Elite ransomware authors have concluded that profit sharing and risk mitigation are key contributors to their consistent success and evasion of authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving landscape of digital security, the adage &amp;ldquo;patch or perish&amp;rdquo; encapsulates a stark reality. The timely application of software patches is not just a best practice—it is a necessity. The vulnerabilities that lurk in unpatched software can serve as gateways for cybercriminals, leading to severe breaches, operational disruptions, and substantial financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The imperative to keep software up-to-date has never been more pressing, yet patch management often takes a backseat in organizations. It&amp;rsquo;s not merely a technical oversight; it&amp;rsquo;s a question of diligence and prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Establishing persistence on a system allows a threat actor continued access or process execution across system restarts or other changes. For this reason, monitoring for and investigating persistence indicators are key components of any robust cybersecurity platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two common persistence techniques are using AutoStart Execution of programs during system boot or logon (T1547) and abusing scheduled task functions (T1053). However, legitimate application activity also frequently involves AutoStart Execution and scheduled task functions, so defending against these techniques requires not only detection monitoring but also analysis by a cybersecurity professional. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Is it still that fast, or does even the simplest task seem to take forever? Before you ditch your current PC, there’s a way to get it running like new again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First things first, though—you have to understand why your PC is running slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-computers-slow-down-with-age&#34;&gt;Do computers slow down with age?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had your PC for a while, you might think it’s running slower because of aging hardware.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Businesses face myriad cybersecurity risks, from phishing to unauthorized access of proprietary information. While restricting access rights and maintaining strict security measures can help, potential insider threats are always a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations must effectively monitor for signs of insider threats to prevent financial loss or the compromise of critical assets. Creating an insider threat program to raise awareness and mitigate insider threat risks is an excellent step toward going beyond standard security against external attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Signaling System 7&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;SS7&lt;/strong&gt;) is a set of protocol suite telecommunication networks used to share information across the global public switched telephone network (PSTN). It was developed in the 1980s and has been used ever since. The SS7 protocol is crucial to the functioning of telecom networks, as it helps to set up and end voice calls, data transfers, and other network services. However, over its use since its inception, security flaws in the SS7 protocol have been identified which enable hackers to execute a range of many virtualattacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s no unified approach across jurisdictions and even within a single country like Australia, the closest we&amp;rsquo;ve got to that is a government scheme usually intended for accessing public services. And even if there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a technically workable model, who wants to get either the gov or some big tech firm involved in their use of Instagram or Pornhub?! There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; acceptance to be considered and not only that, circumvention of age controls is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy when you can simply VPN into another jurisdiction and access the same website blocked in your locale. Or in the case of the adult material, I&amp;rsquo;m told (🤷‍♂️) there are many other legally operating websites in other parts of the world that are less inclined to block individuals in specific states from foreign countries. There&amp;rsquo;ll be no easy solutions for this one, but it&amp;rsquo;ll make for an entertaining year 😊&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Are Computer Worms?</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/what-are-computer-worms/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/what-are-computer-worms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s interconnected digital world, businesses are constantly under threat from cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and devices. One of the most persistent and silent threats that organizations face is computer worms. These malicious programs can spread across networks, infecting systems autonomously and wreaking havoc before a user even realizes something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computer worms are a type of malware designed to replicate themselves and spread autonomously across networks and computer systems. Unlike traditional viruses that require user action to propagate, computer worms can self-replicate without needing to attach to a host file or program. This unique capability makes them especially dangerous, as they can spread rapidly and infect numerous devices before users are even aware of their presence. The impact of computer worms can range from reduced system performance to the complete loss of critical data. High-profile attacks, such as those by the infamous Code Red and WannaCry worms, have highlighted how severe and disruptive these threats can be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/what-is-malware-and-its-types/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term “malicious software” is shortened to “malware.” Malware is invasive software that is purposefully created to harm computers and computer networks. On the other hand, software that unintentionally causes harm is typically called a software bug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, inquiries are made regarding the distinction between malware and viruses. The distinction is that ransomware, which encompasses various online threats such as viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware, is referred to as malware. To put it simply, one kind of malware is a computer virus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A portion of the internet known as the “dark web” cannot be found by search engines and must be accessed through the use of the anonymizing browser Tor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A portion of the internet known as the “dark web” is not indexed by search engines. You’ve likely heard of the “dark web” being a hub for illegal activity, and this is true. After classifying the contents of 2,723 active dark web sites over five weeks in 2015, researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid of King’s College in London discovered that 57% of them hosted illegal content. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to insider threats and cybersecurity in general, experts often discuss how to practice policies of containment, and use these to mitigate threats. One fundamental way to do this is through the process of network segmentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-network-segmentation&#34;&gt;What is network segmentation?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Network segmentation means that you essentially create smaller subnetworks linked to each other, so that you structure your network better, for a few key benefits. First, it’s easier to see network activity and monitor it within these smaller systems. Second, it can enhance performance across the network. Third, it promotes the use of a zero trust strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s by far the single most time-consuming activity in processing breaches for Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) and frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s about the most thankless task I can imagine. Finding contact details is hard. Getting responses is hard. Not having an organisation just automatically assume you&amp;rsquo;re trying to shake them down for cash is hard. So hard, in fact, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d record the process end-to-end and share it publicly to help demonstrate just how painful the process is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We see it every day; weight loss pills, make money fast schemes and if you travel in the same circles I do, claims that extended validation (EV) certificates actually do something useful:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone had reached out to me privately and shared the offending page as they&amp;rsquo;d taken issue with the false claims DigiCert was making. My views on certificate authority shenanigans spinning yarns on EV are well known after having done many talks on the topic and written many blog posts, most recently in August 2019 after both Chrome and Firefox announced they were killing it. When I say &amp;ldquo;kill&amp;rdquo;, that never meant that EV would no longer &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; work, but it killed the single thing spruikers of it relied upon - being visually present beside the address bar. That was 2 and a half years ago, so why is DigiCert still pimping the message about the green bar with the company name? Beats me (although I could gue$$), but clearly DigiCert had a change of heart after that tweet because a day later, the offending image was gone. You can still see the original version in the Feb 9 snapshot on archive.org:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Usually, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to articulate a data breach; a service people provide their information to had someone snag it through an act of unauthorised access and publish a discrete corpus of information that can be attributed back to that source. But in the case of National Public Data, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a data aggregator most people had never heard of where a &amp;ldquo;threat actor&amp;rdquo; has published various &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt; sets of data with no clear way to attribute it back to the source. And they&amp;rsquo;re already the subject of a class action, to add yet another variable into the mix. I&amp;rsquo;ve been collating information related to this incident over the last couple of months, so let me talk about what&amp;rsquo;s known about the incident, what data is circulating and what remains a bit of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; 12 days after publishing this blog post, it looks like the &amp;ldquo;alleged&amp;rdquo; caveat can be dropped, see the addition at the end of the post for more.) But sometimes, &amp;ldquo;alleged&amp;rdquo; is just where we need to begin and over the course of time, proper attribution is made and the dots are joined. We&amp;rsquo;re here at &amp;ldquo;alleged&amp;rdquo; for two very simple reasons: one is that AT&amp;amp;T is saying &amp;ldquo;the data didn&amp;rsquo;t come from us&amp;rdquo;, and the other is that I have no way of proving otherwise. But I have proven, with sufficient confidence, that the data is real and the impact is significant. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve all since watched enough crime shows to understand that fingerprints are unique personal biometric attributes and to date, no two people have ever been found to have a matching set. As technology has evolved, fingers (and palms and irises and faces) have increasingly been used as a means of biometric authentication. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on a PC that uses a Verifi fingerprint reader. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably continue to draft it from a comfy spot later on using my Lenovo laptop that has a built in reader. I&amp;rsquo;ll also go backwards and forward between my iPhone and iPad with Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They&amp;rsquo;d left a MongoDB instance exposed to the public without a password and someone had snagged all their data. Within the data were references that granted access to voice recordings made by children, stored in an S3 bucket that also had no auth. So, why didn&amp;rsquo;t CloudPets respond to attempts to contact them? Their CEO later explained it very succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a tale of firewalls, APIs and sifting through layers and layers of different services to sniff out the root cause of something that seemed very benign, but actually turned out to be highly impactful. Let&amp;rsquo;s go find the rabbits!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, the topic of email bombing has been brought to our attention multiple times, mostly queries from customers that go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=21158977&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustwave.com%2Fen-us%2Fresources%2Fblogs%2Fspiderlabs-blog%2Femail-bombing-why-you-need-to-be-concerned%2F&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.trustwave.com%252Fen-us%252Fresources%252Fblogs%252Fspiderlabs-blog&amp;amp;bvt=rss&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was one with an attractive girl and a square superimposed over her shoulder doing the rounds a little while ago too. I’ve seen others where the instructions are more explicit in terms of words or phrases to type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Trustwave SpiderLabs covered a massive fake order spam scheme that impersonated a tech support company and propagated via Google Groups. Since then, we have observed more spam campaigns using this hybrid form of cyberattack with varying tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Between July and September, we witnessed a 140% increase in these spam campaigns. In this blog, we will showcase the different spam techniques used in these phishing emails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

NO WAY!&lt;/em&gt;” This one, as far as infosec stories go, had me leaning and muttering like never before. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week, someone reached out to me with what they claimed was a Spoutible data breach obtained by exploiting an enumerable API. Just your classic case of putting someone else&amp;rsquo;s username in the URL and getting back data about them, which at first glance I assumed was another scraping situation like we recently saw with Trello. They sent me a file with 207k scraped records and a URL that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I knew I&amp;rsquo;d seen a metric about this sometime recently, so I went looking for &amp;ldquo;7,000&amp;rdquo;, which perfectly illustrates how unaware we are of the extent of data collection on all of us. I started Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) in the first place because I was surprised at where my data had turned up in breaches. 11 years and 14 billion breached records later, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; surprised!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/37963795Photo-30-11-2013-15-27-072.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Inside the Facebook Snapchat phishing scam&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more salacious content you find around Facebook often has a hidden agenda, for example the classic She did WHAT in school scam I wrote about last year. Snapchat allows you to take a pic or a video and set an expiry date after which it’s “theoretically” destroyed, just the sort of stuff that appeals to sexting teens. By extension, “leaked” Snapchats are just the sort of stuff that appeal to a whole different audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s also something I do almost entirely in isolation, sitting here on my own trying to put the pieces together to work out what happened. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just chuck data into HIBP and the first an organisation knows about it is angry customers smashing out their inbox, there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a reasonable attempt from my side to get in touch, disclose and then coordinate on communication to impacted parties and the public at large. Very frequently, I end up reaching out publicly and asking for a security contact at the impacted company. I dislike doing this because it&amp;rsquo;s a very public broadcast that regular followers easily read between the lines of and draw precisely the correct conclusion before the organisation has had a chance to respond. And the vast majority of the time, nobody has a contact anyway but a small handful of people trawl through the site and find obscure email addresses or look up employees on LinkedIn or similar. There has to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In part, I suspect this is due to the approaching holiday shopping season and in part because I know this scam is really doing the rounds and being seen by a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had a chat with Dan Kaplan from Secure Computing Magazine for their podcast and pointed out a number of factors that make scams like this successful:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not the metaphorical kind in terms of &amp;ldquo;I bought some random shit online&amp;rdquo;, but literal shit. Turds. Faeces. The kind of thing you never would have thought possible to buy online until&amp;hellip; Shitexpress came along. Here&amp;rsquo;s a service that enables you to send &lt;em&gt;an actual piece of smelly shit&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;ldquo;An irritating colleague. School teacher. Your ex-wife. Filthy boss. Jealous neighbour. That successful former classmate. Or all those pesky haters.&amp;rdquo; But it would be weird if the intended recipient of the aforementioned shit knew it came from you, so, Shitexpress makes a bold commitment:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’ve recorded their audio, recorded their video, antagonised them, interviewed one of the blokes behind it, tried to tell them I was Dutch and even convinced them that I was Mick Dundee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I used to get them all the time – the ones where they’d call up and say you had viruses on your PC – and my recordings of those turned out to be rather popular. But today I had another call, although this one went a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And let me be even more specific: should they disclose to &lt;em&gt;impacted individuals,&lt;/em&gt; or simply never let them know? I&amp;rsquo;m writing this after many recent such discussions with breached organisations where I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wishing I had this blog post to point them to, so, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Except that the address is a perfect match with this one:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Parts of this story relate to very sensitive incidents and parts to criminal activity, not just on behalf of those executing data breaches but also very likely on behalf of some organisations handling them. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to refer to any specific incidents or company names, rather I&amp;rsquo;m going to speak more generally to what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was predominantly sympathetic to the position I find myself in running HIBP, and that post was mostly one of frustration: lack of disclosure, standoffish organisations, downplaying breaches and the individual breach victims themselves making it worse by going to town on the corporate victims. But the other angle that&amp;rsquo;s been milling around in my brain is the one represented by the image here:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As suggested earlier, I broadcast this one via Periscope and you can can go back and watch it via the app. I’ll be more organised next time and have a special machine ready for them :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These things just don’t stop. I had my first seriously nasty one a few years ago which I summarily recorded, annotated and published for amusement and education. 817k views later and, well, clearly these are both entertaining and unabating so I keep capturing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No, I’m not revealing my address or my account numbers or my password because frankly, I don’t trust you. Don’t get me wrong – it’s not because of your foreign accent – but it’s because it’s part of a larger tapestry of suspicious attributes of the call.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If I was to guess, I think it&amp;rsquo;s just seeing people work through the logic of how things work and how we might be able to approach things differently, and doing it in real time very candidly. I&amp;rsquo;m totally happy doing that, and the comments from the audience did give us more good food for thought too. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and line up a session just like that before the end of the year, we&amp;rsquo;ve certainly got no shortage of material!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Easy fix, moving on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the livestream, I was perplexed as to why the HIBP DB was suddenly maxing out. Turns out that this aligned with &lt;em&gt;dropping&lt;/em&gt; a constraint on the table of domains which appears to have caused the table to reindex and massively slow down the queries for breached email addresses. Further, we simultaneously started having problems related to MAXDOP (the maximum degree of parallelism for the stored procedure running the query), which was only resolved after we forced it to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; run on multiple CPUs by setting it to 1 (weirdly, 2 is also fine but 3 or higher completely killed perf). Fun times, running a service like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I just suddenly thought of that when realising how long this week&amp;rsquo;s video went for with no real plan other than to talk about our HIBP backlog. People seem to love this in the same way I loved listening to the guys a decade and a half ago. I&amp;rsquo;ll do one of these with Stefan as well over the course of this month, let us know what you&amp;rsquo;d like to hear about 😊&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As I said in the video (many times!), the amount of attention this has garnered from both Earth 2 users and the company itself is incommensurate with the impact of the incident itself. It&amp;rsquo;s a nothing-burger. Email addresses and usernames, that&amp;rsquo;s it, and of course, their association with the service, which may lead to some very targeted spam or phishing attempts. It&amp;rsquo;s still a breach by any reasonable definition of the term, but it should have been succinctly summarised and disclosed to impacted parties with everyone moving on with more important things in life a few moments later. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do right now 😊&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s partly because after 3 decades of writing software (and doing some meaningful stuff along the way), I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly concerned about showing my weaknesses. And this week, I screwed up a bunch of stuff; database queries that weren&amp;rsquo;t resilient to SQL database scale changes, partially completed breach notifications I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until it was too late to easily fix, and some queries that performed so badly they crashed the entire breach notification process after loading the massive DemandScience incident. Fortunately, none of them had any impact of note, we fixed them all and re-ran processes, and now we&amp;rsquo;re more resilient than ever 😄&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On the contrary, we&amp;rsquo;re putting in huge amounts of effort to get this thing fast, stable, and sustainable. We could do the first two very easily just by throwing money at the cloud, but that makes the last one a bit hard. Besides, both Stefán and I do enjoy the challenge of optimising an increasingly large system to run on a shoestring and even though the days of &amp;ldquo;a coffee a day of running costs&amp;rdquo; are well behind us, arguably the cost per request (or some other usage-based metric) is better than ever. I hope you enjoy this chat between the two of us and as I say in the video, do please chime in with your thoughts and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So many of the incidents I deal with are relatively benign in terms of either the data they expose or the nature of the service, but some of them this year were absolute zingers. This week, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the ones that really stuck out to me for one reason or another, here&amp;rsquo;s the top 5:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I post lots of pics to my Facebook account, and if none of that is interesting, here&amp;rsquo;s this week&amp;rsquo;s video on more infosec-related topics:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Writing this the day after recording, it feels like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from Dubai; the temperature starts with a minus, it&amp;rsquo;s snowing and there&amp;rsquo;s not a supercar in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back on business, this week I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the challenge of loading breaches and managing costs. A breach load immediately takes us from a very high percentage cache hit ratio on Cloudflare to zero. Consequently, our SQL costs skyrocket as the DB scales to support the load. Approximately 28 hours after loading the two breaches I mention in this week&amp;rsquo;s update, we&amp;rsquo;re still running a DB scale that&amp;rsquo;s 350% larger than once we have a high cache hit ratio, and that &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; hits my wallet. We need to work on this more because as I say in the video, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t like financial incentives that influence how breaches are handled, such as delaying them and bulking them together to reduce the impact of cache flush events like this. We&amp;rsquo;ll give that more thought, I think there are a few ways to tackle this. For now, here&amp;rsquo;s this week&amp;rsquo;s video and some of the challenges we&amp;rsquo;re facing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And there&amp;rsquo;s more data breaches, of course, including a couple I loaded over the previous week that I think were particularly interesting. Enjoy this week&amp;rsquo;s video, next week&amp;rsquo;s will be a 2024 wrap-up from somewhere much, much sunnier 😎&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now, where have we seen this sort of behaviour before? 🤔 When I&amp;rsquo;m relying on content that only appears on that platform to add context to a data breach in HIBP &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that content is freely accessible from within the native Bluesky app (without needing an X account), we&amp;rsquo;re out of reasonable excuses for the negativity. And if &amp;ldquo;because Elon&amp;rdquo; is the sole reason and someone is firm enough in their convictions on that, there&amp;rsquo;s a very easy solution 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And how they put a heap of effort into education to warn folks about the hallmarks of phishing scams? And how banks are the shining beacons of light when it comes to demonstrating security best practices? Ok, that final one might be a bit of a stretch, but the fact remains that people have high expectations of how banks should communicate to ensure that they themselves don&amp;rsquo;t come across as phishers:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cold and wet Thursday morning, sometime in early 2006. There I was sitting at the very top back row of an awe-inspiring lecture theatre inside Royal Holloway&amp;rsquo;s Founder’s Building in Egham, Surrey (UK) while studying for my MSc in Information Security. Back then, the lecture in progress was from the software security module.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=21158977&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustwave.com%2Fen-us%2Fresources%2Fblogs%2Fspiderlabs-blog%2Fwhen-user-input-lines-are-blurred-indirect-prompt-injection-attack-vulnerabilities-in-ai-llms%2F&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.trustwave.com%252Fen-us%252Fresources%252Fblogs%252Fspiderlabs-blog&amp;amp;bvt=rss&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The 2021 Version&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More than 3 years ago now, Scott Helme and I launched a little project called Why No HTTPS? It listed the world&amp;rsquo;s largest websites that didn&amp;rsquo;t properly redirect insecure requests to secure ones. We updated it December before last and pleasingly, noted that more websites than ever were doing the right thing and forcing browsers down the secure path. That&amp;rsquo;s the good news, the bad news is that there are still some really wacky, unexplainable anti-HTTPS views out there, but those voices are increasingly less relevant as the browsers march forward:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T recently faced a significant cybersecurity breach involving its Snowflake account, leading to the company allegedly paying a ransom to prevent further data leakage. According to various reports, the telecommunications giant paid approximately $370,000 to the hacking group ShinyHunters to delete the stolen data. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges and risks large corporations face in protecting sensitive customer information in an increasingly digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;details-of-the-breach&#34;&gt;Details of the Breach&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The breach was reportedly carried out by ShinyHunters, a notorious hacking group known for its previous cyber-attacks on various companies. The hackers gained access to AT&amp;amp;T’s Snowflake account, a cloud-based data warehousing service, and managed to exfiltrate sensitive customer data, including call logs and personal information. Following the breach, the hackers demanded a ransom for the deletion of the stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a leading semiconductor company, is investigating a potential cybersecurity breach after a threat actor, known by the pseudonym IntelBroker, listed allegedly stolen data for sale on a notorious hacking forum. The hacker’s post on the forum claims to have sensitive data from AMD’s internal systems, including employee and customer information, as well as details on future products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IntelBroker, a well-known figure in the cybercrime community, announced the sale in a short thread, stating, “Today, I’m selling the AMD.com data.” This has raised significant concerns about the potential impact on AMD and its stakeholders. The hacker is reportedly seeking cryptocurrency in exchange for the stolen information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Tesla Wall Connector is a Level 2 electric vehicle charge station designed for use by residential home users. The device has a minimal user interface in its hardware, providing a Wi-Fi based interface for configuration and an NFC reader for user authentication. The device does not come with a dedicated mobile application out of the box; the initial configuration—which is rather minimal—is performed via the web interface. After that, the device suggests the Tesla One app is to be used for further configuration. The Tesla app allows connecting to the device but apparently can only be used to perform a few functions such as scheduled charging and viewing information about the device. It does not offer options for further configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I recently presented my Exchange-related talk during OffensiveCon 2024. This series of 4 blog posts is meant to supplement the talk and provide additional technical details. You can read the first post in this series here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In part 2, I describe the &lt;code&gt;ApprovedApplicationCollection&lt;/code&gt; gadget, which was available for abuse because it did not appear on the deny list and could therefore be accessed via &lt;code&gt;MultiValuedProperty&lt;/code&gt;. I am also presenting a path traversal in the Windows utility &lt;code&gt;extrac32.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which allowed me to complete the chain for a full RCE in Exchange. For the moment, at least, Microsoft has made a decision not to fix this path traversal bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post highlights two additional vulnerabilities in the Autel Maxicharger that were exploited at Pwn2Own Automotive 2024. Details of the patches are also included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autel has been informed and has deployed a firmware update (v1.35) to address both of these issues. If you want to read about other Autel bugs reported at Pwn2Own, you check out our earlier blog here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Vulnerability: CVE-2024-23967 (ZDI-CAN-23230)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Computest Sector 7 identified and exploited a stack-based buffer overflow in v1.32 of the Autel firmware. This vulnerability stems from the decoding of base64 encoded data that can be controlled by an attacker. The encoded data is decoded into a fixed-size stack buffer with no bounds checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/from-trusted-platform-to-attack-vector-the-story-of-docusign-api-misuse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a concerning development within cybersecurity, attackers have been leveraging DocuSign’s API capabilities to send out fraudulent invoices that closely mimic genuine documents. These campaigns have been rising in frequency, with reports over the past five months highlighting a significant uptick in incidents. In the context of cybersecurity, the abuse of DocuSign’s API represents a significant shift away from traditional phishing methods. Conventional phishing attacks typically involve sending spoofed emails that mimic trusted brands to trick victims into clicking malicious links or entering sensitive data, such as login credentials. Email and anti-spam filters have evolved to detect and block these deceptive tactics effectively, making it more difficult for attackers to succeed using traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a significant cybersecurity incident, the threat actor group known as ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a data breach involving Santander Bank, allegedly selling data for 30 million customers. This breach, disclosed two weeks after unauthorized access was detected, has been linked to recent hacks of Snowflake accounts, which also implicated Ticketmaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.exploitone.com/snews-up/2024/06/santander-hacked2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;shinyhunters-claims-santander-breach&#34;&gt;ShinyHunters Claims Santander Breach&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On May 31, 2024, ShinyHunters announced they were selling a massive trove of data allegedly stolen from Santander Bank, including personal information for 30 million customers and employees. The data also reportedly contains 28 million credit card numbers and 6 million account numbers. This claim came shortly after Spain’s largest bank, Santander, reported a data breach affecting customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous Kenwood DMX958XR blog post, we detailed the internals of the Kenwood in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) head unit and provided annotated pictures of each PCB. In this post, we aim to outline the attack surface of the DMX958XR in the hopes of providing inspiration for vulnerability research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will cover the main supported technologies that present potential attack surfaces, such as USB, Bluetooth, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Kenwood apps, and more. We also provide a list of the open-source components the DMX958XR claims to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest, a total of four in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) head units have been selected as targets. One of these is the double DIN Kenwood DMX958XR. This unit offers a variety of functionality, such as wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, as well as USB media playback, wireless mirroring, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog post presents internal photos of the DMX958XR boards and highlights each of the interesting components. A hidden debugging interface is also detailed which can be leveraged to obtain a root shell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple Vulnerabilities in the Mazda In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) System</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-the-mazda-in-vehicle-infotainment-ivi-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Mazda Connect Connectivity Master Unit (CMU) system installed in multiple car models, such as the Mazda 3 model year 2014-2021. Like in so many cases, these vulnerabilities are caused by insufficient sanitization when handling attacker-supplied input. A physically present attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting a specially crafted USB device – such as an iPod or mass storage device – to the target system. Successful exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The music streaming industry is one of the largest revenue-generating platforms for artists and labels. Streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and others pay royalties to artists based on the number of times their songs are played. However, what if these streaming numbers are not genuine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between 2018 and 2023, &lt;strong&gt;Michael Smith&lt;/strong&gt; masterminded an elaborate scheme to inflate the streaming numbers of music tracks, raking in millions of dollars in fraudulent royalties. Smith’s operation resulted in &lt;strong&gt;4 billion fake streams&lt;/strong&gt; over the course of five years. This article dives deep into how this scam was orchestrated and how the manipulation of music streaming platforms can distort the industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 - our first event ever from the emerald isle! This year’s contest is set to be one of our largest ever - both in terms of entries and potential prizes. If everything hits, we will end up paying out over $1,000,000 in cash and prizes. We’ve got four days of exciting competition ahead. As always, we began our contest with a random drawing to determine the order of attempts. If you missed it, you can watch the replay here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the final day of our first ever Pwn2Own Ireland. After three days of exploitation, we have awarded $993,625, so it seem likely we will pass the $1,000,000 mark. Still, there are no guarantees in Pwn2Own, so stay tuned for all the results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And we are done! Over the four days of the contest, we awarded $1,066,625 for over 70 0-day vulnerabilities. That makes four contests in a row that exceeded the million-dollar mark. Congratulations to the Viettel Cyber Security team for winning Master of Pwn with 33 points and $205,000. Our next event will be January 22-24, 2025 in Tokyo as we return for the second Pwn2Own Automotive. We hope to see you there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I spent some time researching a core SolarWinds product, SolarWinds Platform (previously Orion Platform). At that time, I hadn’t been aware of the SolarWinds Access Right Manager product (Solar Winds ARM).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative began receiving submissions of vulnerabilities in Access Rights Manager (ARM). The first submissions we received were from Sina Kheirkhah (@SinSinology), and one of those was a pre-auth RCE based on the .NET Remoting service. After his issues were patched, we received some additional, anonymous reports, in which pre-auth RCE was achieved via an unauthenticated gRPC/.NET Remoting based service on port 55555/tcp. An unauthenticated attacker was able to call its many methods, which were vulnerable mainly due to:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SysBumps: A Groundbreaking Attack on macOS Kernel Security</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/sysbumps-a-groundbreaking-attack-on-macos-kernel-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a new attack named &lt;strong&gt;SysBumps&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets macOS systems running on Apple Silicon processors. This attack leverages speculative execution vulnerabilities in system calls to bypass critical security measures such as &lt;strong&gt;Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR)&lt;/strong&gt; and kernel isolation. KASLR, a crucial defense mechanism, randomizes the memory layout of the kernel, making it harder for attackers to predict the location of specific functions or data structures. By breaking KASLR, attackers can more easily exploit other vulnerabilities, significantly compromising macOS system security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 5 PST Repair Software for Outlook</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/top-5-pst-repair-software-for-outlook/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/top-5-pst-repair-software-for-outlook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smooth functioning of Microsoft Outlook depends on the health of its data file formats—OST and PST. Both the files store the mailbox data like email messages, contacts, calendars, etc. locally on the system. OST, or offline storage table files, are encrypted with a MAPIEntryID GUID key and are linked with a particular profile. It means accessing this file requires authentication from the linked MAPI profile. In contrast, the PST (Personal Storage Table) file is portable, or transferrable, and can be accessed easily through a different Outlook profile. This portable nature makes PST files more prone to corruption or damage. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
