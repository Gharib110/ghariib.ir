      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.bestdevops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-54.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IT Service Management (ITSM) focuses on the delivery and management of IT services to meet the needs of businesses and end-users. It includes processes like incident management, problem management, change management, and service request management. While ITSM ensures the quality and efficiency of IT services, &lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt; emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Integrating DevOps into ITSM creates a synergy that enhances service delivery, automates key workflows, and accelerates the response to incidents and changes. DevOps principles can improve the efficiency of ITSM processes by enabling faster resolution times, proactive management of incidents, and better alignment of IT services with business needs. This post will explore how DevOps can be used to enhance ITSM, with a focus on its major features and practical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
