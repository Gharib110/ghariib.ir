The new iPhone 16e is Apple&amp;rsquo;s least expensive iPhone, and it just may be all the phone you need. And why do the new iPads not support Apple&amp;rsquo;s most advertised feature?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post What the Heck Is Apple Doing With Its Hardware and Software? – Intego Mac Podcast, Episode 386 appeared first on The Mac Security Blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
