      <title>Bureaucrats Paying for Empty Buildings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Washington, D.C.’s empty federal office buildings rank high among the most visible examples of wasteful government spending. Where else can you find blocks of high-dollar real estate going virtually unused by the very bureaucrats for whom these buildings are supposed to be the nerve centers for their supposed vital functions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, as it turns out, you can find similar examples of federal government waste all across the country. Bureaucrats don’t just pay millions to not use their own buildings. They also pay millions in service contracts to outside organizations for facilities they don’t use either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>California Keeps the COVID Gravy Train Running</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Craig Eyermann notes, the scale of pandemic relief fraud is growing, with $400 billion processed by the Department of Labor and $200 billion through the federal Small Business Administration. As those hunting down waste and fraud should know, pandemic payouts are still going on in California. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order that effectively locked down the Golden State. When he lifted the state of emergency in February 2023, Gov. Newsom kept a key program in place. Consider some of the projects the California COVID Workplace Outreach Project continues to fund.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Canada Has a Trade War Within Its Borders Too</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s tariffs are a disaster for both the Canadian and U.S. economies. As of writing this, the administration has flipped-flopped on implementing them. However, the outcome is nearly as detrimental as imposing tariffs due to the uncertainty that has emerged in our long-standing alliance with America’s neighbor. Canadian businesses have pulled American products off their shelves en masse and American businesses are unable to plan for the long term if they don’t know which inputs they’re able to buy abroad. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remembering the Cost of the Lockdowns</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/remembering-the-cost-of-the-lockdowns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month is the five-year anniversary of the COVID-19 lockdowns in California. In March 2020, I was studying abroad in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I had heard rumors about lockdowns in the West, but nothing had changed in Russia. People continued to move about without a mask, and people certainly were not locked down. Life was normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amid the normalcy, I suddenly received a shocking email: my study abroad had been canceled by my university in the United States. They told me that I needed to return home immediately and to “self-isolate” for 14 days after my return. The contrast between the vibrant streets of Saint Petersburg and that email captured the core of the pandemic; the response to COVID-19 was completely subjective, and these subjective preferences were imposed on the general population, depriving people of liberty, autonomy, and freedom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The “Gulf of America” Is a Geographical Absurdity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge after Jocelyn Nungaray, a Houston girl whose tragic murder at the hands of two unauthorized Venezuelan immigrants, captured national attention. The decision, while framed as an honor to the young victim, raised eyebrows. It marked yet another instance in which Trump leveraged symbolic renaming as a political tool. Previously, in a move that defied geography, diplomacy, and common sense, President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming a section of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dangers of Economic Nationalism</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/the-dangers-of-economic-nationalism/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/the-dangers-of-economic-nationalism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hardly a day goes by without a policy announcement or public statement by President Trump that betrays a nationalist instinct. The first problem with nationalism is semantics. People tend to confuse it with patriotism, a deeply felt emotion that a nationalist can easily stir with a discourse that equates love of country with hostility to the outside world and, domestically, to those presented as a threat to the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Economic nationalists often emphasize the need to protect the nation from perceived threats rather than focusing on the alleged economic advantages of their policies. They argue that foreign countries are taking advantage of us or that a competitor’s dominance in areas like science, technology, or industry is an affront to our nation’s greatness. The latter can be seen when Trump points to Taiwan’s leadership in the chip industry. Taiwan’s leadership is only admissible if its companies make their semiconductors in the U.S.—under threat of reprisals if they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Economic Outlook: Policy Shifts and Early Impact</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/trumps-economic-outlook-policy-shifts-and-early-impact/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a little more than a month back in the White House in 2025, Donald Trump’s presidency has already left a profound mark on the U.S. economy, reigniting debates over tariffs, inflation, unemployment, and the broader economic trajectory. His return was heralded by promises of revitalizing American industry, curbing inflation, and restoring economic dominance. However, the reality of his first 40 days paints a more complex picture, shaped by inherited challenges, aggressive policy shifts, and a global economy less forgiving than in his previous term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Tariffs Are Reviving Canada’s Progressives</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/trumps-tariffs-are-reviving-canadas-progressives/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;President Trump entered the Oval Office like a tornado, signing more executive orders in his first two weeks than any president has signed in his first 100 days since President Harry Truman. His America First agenda will reshape trade and foreign policy, ushering in a new protectionist era. His imposition of tariffs, and bluster in wanting to make Canada the 51st state, has not only increased Canada’s anxiety level but revived the political fortunes of the country’s left-leaning Liberal establishment. A recent Leger poll found that 75 percent of Canadians view President Trump negatively and 13 percent view him favorably. This has galvanized Canadians around the Liberal Party, stealing support from the socialist NDP and the Conservatives who have lost their big lead in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is America Poised to Overreact to DeepSeek?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several days have been dubbed a “Sputnik moment” for Americans, who are discovering that foreign software engineers are much further ahead than previously thought. On January 20th, the Chinese company DeepSeek announced the release of their newest large language model (LLM) “DeepSeek R1.” Reportedly trained for just $6 million, DeepSeek R1 achieves capabilities that more than rival the output of American AI giants like Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Google, whose models have required billions in investment. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump Should Increase High-Skilled Immigration</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/trump-should-increase-high-skilled-immigration/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/trump-should-increase-high-skilled-immigration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s and Vivek Ramaswamy’s support for increasing high-skilled immigration visas has stirred up a political storm within conservative circles. Although Trump has supported Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s comments, his words conflict with his first-term immigration policies. If his change in rhetoric is matched by a change in policy, it would help make America great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with improving government efficiency, both recently suggested that increasing the number of high-skill H-1B visas would improve the U.S. economy. Musk wrote on X that more H-1B visas are needed because “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Congress Must Stop Trading Stocks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Legislators—Congressmen and Senators—routinely receive material non-public information that is crucial to crafting legislation for the US government to operate efficiently and meet the needs of the American people. Unfortunately, many legislators use this information to enrich themselves at the expense of the very people they are elected to represent. Using privileged information for personal gain is a tremendous abuse of power and tantamount to graft. Service in the Congress is an honor. Legislators, senior officials in the executive and judicial branches, and their families should be prohibited from trading in individual securities. Those officials who have profited from this abuse of power have revealed their lack of moral fiber and should no longer serve in government. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Of Budgets and Biases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Austrian economist Gene Callahan likes to remind us that fantasy is not an adult policy option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are often reminded of his words in national debates and handwringing over potential budget cuts, whether by the Republican-led Congress, or President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—or attempts to address the $36 trillion debt elephant in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Economist Bryan Caplan has pointed out a number of systematically biased beliefs American voters hold about the economy. Generally, Americans tend to hold four basic biases about the economy: an anti-market bias, leading to favor government intervention; an anti-foreign bias, which leads them to underestimate the contributions of foreigners and the benefits of trade; a make-work bias, which equates prosperity with the number of jobs (regardless of productivity or value added); and a pessimism bias, which leads them to think that economic conditions are far worse than they really are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Resurgence of Tariffs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and a further 10% tariff on Chinese imports, to take effect on Feb. 1. In doing so Trump built on tariffs he put into effect during his first term—tariffs that President Joe Biden largely kept in place or added to. This resurgence of tariffs provide a good reason for revisiting economic history and what the science of economics tells us about international trade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bureaucrats Ordered to Go Back to Work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The offices where Washington D.C.’s bureaucrats work were largely empty on Monday, January 20, 2025, as Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. President for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But they weren’t empty for the inauguration. Because that Monday coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day federal holiday, most U.S. government employees had a paid day off work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then, many of the federal government’s buildings continued to sit empty on Tuesday, January 21, and again on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons from the Republic of Georgia on Economic Freedom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was told by many people that the United States was the only free country in the world, the land of the free, which implicitly suggested that every other country was somehow not free. I thought that other countries were tyrannical states, which subjugated their citizens and treated them like slaves. As I grew older, I realized that nothing was further from the truth. A myriad of free societies exist throughout the world, many of which are free in ways that are completely different from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neoliberalism Never Happened</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/neoliberalism-never-happened/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/neoliberalism-never-happened/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Neoliberalism is a myth. The concept suggests that starting in the 1970s Western economies have been shaped by free-market principles, the state has retreated, and markets have reigned supreme. And yet, the last fifty years were not about liberalizing, but about strengthening the state. Neoliberalism never happened. Instead, what unfolded was neostatism—a strategy where governments restructured their role to protect and expand their power. From the late 1970s onward, policies branded as “neoliberal” were crafted not to relinquish state control but to reassert it. And today, as overt state intervention returns with a vengeance, it becomes clear that the “neoliberal era” was a carefully managed illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Banking Surveillance Industrial Complex</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bombshell report was released in December of 2024 by the House Judiciary Committee, revealing that a massive and constitutionally dubious surveillance operation has been underway by the federal government against countless Americans. Titled, &lt;em&gt;“How the Federal Government Weaponized the Bank Secrecy Act to Spy on Americans,”&lt;/em&gt; its key findings demonstrate that the FBI and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have been working together to undermine the 4th Amendment and conduct widespread &lt;em&gt;warrantless surveillance&lt;/em&gt; on the financial transactions of innocent U.S. citizens engaging in constitutionally protected behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Governments Fail, Private Initiative Is the Solution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a disturbing number of incidents in recent years, local governments have withheld critical services, resulting in destruction and death. Consider, for example, the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officers waited for 77 minutes inside Robb Elementary School before confronting and killing the active shooter who murdered 21 people—19 children and two teachers—and trapped 36 people in a room, many of whom were shot and dying. In the final incident review by the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Merrick Garland called the law enforcement response “a failure,” but “criminal” is likely more accurate. Two of the responding officers will go on trial in Texas in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I Racist?&lt;/em&gt;, Matt Walsh’s searing attack on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, dominated the documentary film box office in 2024. Screening in 1,600 theaters at its height, the film earned $12.3 million before streaming on the Daily Wire. Walsh’s film grossed more at the box office than any other documentary since 2019. That’s when Peter Jackson’s artistically boundary-pushing World War I film &lt;em&gt;They Shall Not Grow Old&lt;/em&gt; brought in $12.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
