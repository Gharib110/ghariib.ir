      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trigger warning: incredibly wonky theoretical cryptography post (written by a non-theorist)!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Also, this will be in two parts. I plan to be back with some more thoughts on practical stuff, like cloud backup, in the near future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read my blog over the years, you should understand that I have basically two obsessions. One is my interest in building “practical” schemes that solve real problems that come up in the real world. The other is a weird fixation on the theoretical models that underpin (the security of) many of those same schemes. In particular, one of my favorite bugaboos is a particular model, or “heuristic”, called the random oracle model (ROM) — essentially a fancy way to think about hash functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
