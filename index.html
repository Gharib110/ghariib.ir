	<div>
		<p>Developers need a fast, secure, and reliable way to build, share, and run applications — and Docker makes that easy. With the Docker Desktop 4.39 release, we’re excited to announce a few developer productivity enhancements including Docker AI Agent with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Kubernetes support, general availability of Docker Desktop CLI, and `platform` flag support for more seamless multi-platform image management.</p>

		<p>Docker simplifies containerization by removing runtime complexity and making app development seamless. With Docker Engine v28, we’re taking another step forward in security by ensuring containers aren’t unintentionally accessible from local networks. This update isn’t about fixing a single vulnerability — it’s about security hardening so your containers stay safe. </p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>When you run a container on the default Docker “bridge” network, Docker sets up <strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong> rules using your system’s firewall (via iptables). For example, the following command forwards traffic from port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. </p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The emergence of containerization has brought about a significant transformation in software development and deployment by providing a consistent and scalable environment on many platforms. For developers trying to optimize their operations, Docker in particular has emerged as the preferred technology.  By using containers as the foundation, developers gain the same key benefits — portability, scalability, efficiency, and security — that they rely on for other workloads, seamlessly extending them to ML and AI applications. Using a real-world example involving a Snake AI game, we’ll examine in this article how TensorFlow.js can be used with Docker to run AI/ML in a web browser.</p>

<p>As a platform engineer at a mid-size startup, I’m responsible for identifying bottlenecks and developing solutions to streamline engineering operations to keep up with the velocity and scale of the engineering organization. In this post, I outline some of the challenges we faced with one of our clients, how we addressed them, and provide guides on how to tackle these challenges at your company.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At Docker, we are committed to ensuring that Docker Hub remains the best place for developers, engineering teams, and operations teams to build, share, and collaborate. As part of this, we previously announced plans to introduce image pull consumption fees and storage-based billing. After further evaluating how developers use Docker Hub and what will best support the ecosystem, we have refined our approach—one that prioritizes developer experience and enables developers to scale with confidence while reinforcing Docker Hub as the foundation of the cloud-native ecosystem.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Modern software development emphasizes speed and agility, making efficient testing crucial. DORA research reveals that elite teams thrive with both high performance and reliability. They can achieve 127x faster lead times, 182x more deployments per year, 8x lower change failure rates and most impressively, 2,293x faster recovery times after incidents. The secret sauce is they “shift left.” </p>
<p>Shift-Left is a practice that moves integration activities like testing and security earlier in the development cycle, allowing teams to detect and fix issues before they reach production. By incorporating local and integration tests early, developers can prevent costly late-stage defects, accelerate development, and improve software quality. </p>

	<b><time>07.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Just before the year starts to wrap up, we are getting the final 2024 release out! This contains a wide range of updates and changes, which are in already in effect, ready for immediate download, or updating.</p>
<p>The summary of the changelog since the 2024.3 release from September is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python 3.12</strong> - New default Python version <em>(Au revoir <code>pip</code>, hello pipx)</em></li>
<li><strong>The End Of The i386 Kernel and Images</strong> - Farewell x86 <em>(images)</em>, but not goodbye <em>(packages)</em></li>
<li><strong>Deprecations in the SSH Client: DSA keys</strong> - Reminder about using <code>ssh1</code> if required</li>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi Imager Customizations Support</strong> - Able to alter settings at write time</li>
<li><strong>GNOME 47</strong> - Now able to synchronize your favorite colors</li>
<li><strong>Kali Forums Refresh</strong> - New heart of the community home</li>
<li><strong>Kali NetHunter</strong> - Updates to the app, kernels, installer, store and website!</li>
<li><strong>New Tools</strong> - 14 new shiny toys added <em>(and countless updated!)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-new-python-version-312">A New Python Version: 3.12</h2>
<p><strong>Python 3.12 is now the default Python interpreter</strong>. While it was released upstream a year ago , it took a bit of time to become the default in Debian , and then even more time to make it to Kali Linux , but finally it’s here. Every new version of Python brings along some deprecations or subtle changes of behavior, which in turn breaks some Python packages, and we have to investigate and fix all the issues reported by our QA system. Hence the delay.</p>
