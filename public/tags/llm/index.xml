      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure this will matter in the end, but it’s a positive move:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a “hacking-as-a-service” scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company’s platform for AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: extremely wonky cryptography post. Also, possibly stupid and bound for nowhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest problems in applied cryptography (and perhaps all of computer science!) is explaining &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; our tools work the way they do. After all, we’ve been gifted an amazing basket of useful algorithms from those who came before us. Hence it’s perfectly understandable for practitioners to want to take those gifts and simply start to apply them. But sometimes this approach leaves us wondering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re doing certain things: in these cases it’s helpful to take a step back and think about what’s actually going on, and perhaps what was in the inventors’ heads when the tools were first invented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
