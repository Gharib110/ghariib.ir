      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs associated with insider threats continued to rise in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is bad news for organizations that are already under financial pressure from the uncertainty of the economy. As interest rates continue to climb and customers become more conservative about how they spend, the last thing that any organization needs is to be putting out fires from security incidents coming from arsonists inside their own house.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, a variety of factors, not the least of which are sizable layoffs hitting companies and the fluidity of access to data, make the possibility of an insider threat increasingly likely. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Businesses face myriad cybersecurity risks, from phishing to unauthorized access of proprietary information. While restricting access rights and maintaining strict security measures can help, potential insider threats are always a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations must effectively monitor for signs of insider threats to prevent financial loss or the compromise of critical assets. Creating an insider threat program to raise awareness and mitigate insider threat risks is an excellent step toward going beyond standard security against external attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to insider threats and cybersecurity in general, experts often discuss how to practice policies of containment, and use these to mitigate threats. One fundamental way to do this is through the process of network segmentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-network-segmentation&#34;&gt;What is network segmentation?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Network segmentation means that you essentially create smaller subnetworks linked to each other, so that you structure your network better, for a few key benefits. First, it’s easier to see network activity and monitor it within these smaller systems. Second, it can enhance performance across the network. Third, it promotes the use of a zero trust strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
