      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced digital world, businesses need to adapt quickly to changing market demands. This has led to the rise of &lt;strong&gt;low-code development platforms&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;OutSystems&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Appian&lt;/strong&gt;, which are revolutionizing the way software is developed. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into why low-code development is the future of software engineering and how these platforms are shaping this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-low-code-development&#34;&gt;What is Low-Code Development?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Low-code development platforms allow developers to create applications through graphical user interfaces and configuration rather than traditional hand-coded programming. This approach drastically reduces the time and effort required to develop applications, making it accessible to both professional developers and business users with minimal coding experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a fairly simple interface that sends I2S digital audio data down a short length of optical fibre, and it‚Äôs designed to run between something like a CD player and an external DAC. It‚Äôs ancient technology in optical fibre terms, with a lowish data rate and plastic fibre, but consider for a minute whether it could be adapted for modern ultra-high-speed conenctions. It‚Äôs what [Ben Cartwright-Cox] has done, and he delivered a talk about it at the recent 38C3 event in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2FA over SMS isn&amp;rsquo;t just unreliable, it&amp;rsquo;s also a security risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MFA, or Multi-Factor Authentication, has proliferated throughout our computing lives over the last decade. It largely began with SMS-based authentication in addition to a password, allowing users to add an extra layer of authentication by forcing users to enter a code sent to their phone upon an attempted login. The truth is, SMS-based authentication was never secure. Due to the inherent technology and the infrastructure around SIM cards, 2FA with SMS is not only inadequate; it also actively compromises your security, and here are 4 reasons why you should use a dedicated 2FA app instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An overview of virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) in Linux</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/an-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-in-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/an-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-in-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is a network virtualization technique allowing traffic isolation at the layer 3 (L3) of the OSI model by creating independent routing and forwarding domains. It is essentially the combination of a separate routing table and associated network interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other networking techniques exist but are operating at a different levels‚Äîsuch as VLAN and network namespaces, respectively at the layer 2 and at the device level. Those techniques can be combined, e.g., a VRF can be part of a network namespace and/or VLANs can be attached to a VRF. Note that a network namespace might look like a way to emulate a VRF but they differ in how traffic is handled, notably VRF does not impact layer 2 (L2) traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A security flaw has been discovered in Microsoft‚Äôs Azure App Service that exposed source code for customer applications written in Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby for at least four years since September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Wiz researchers, the vulnerability, codenamed ‚ÄúNot Legit,‚Äù was first reported to the tech giant on October 7, 2021, and mitigations were implemented to fix the bug in November. Microsoft said ‚Äúa limited subset of customers‚Äù are at risk. ‚ÄúCustomers who deployed code to App Service Linux via Local Git after files had already been created in the application are the only impacted customers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We assess with high confidence that the same actor is responsible for earlier attacks attributed to BlueNoroff and the RustDoor/ThiefBucket and RustBucket campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs observed the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the Zsh configuration file &lt;code&gt;zshenv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The campaign, which we dubbed ‚ÄòHidden Risk‚Äô, uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets via a malicious application disguised as a PDF file.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency-related businesses have been targets of North Korean-affiliated threat actors for some time now, with multiple campaigns aiming to steal funds and/or insert backdoor malware into targets. In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‚ÄòRustBucket‚Äô, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic‚Äôs discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the availability of a proof-of-concept (POC) tool on December 12, Microsoft is urging customers to patch two security vulnerabilities in Active Directory domain controllers that it addressed in November.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two vulnerabilities are identified as CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287. They both affect Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and have a severity rating of 7.5. Both bugs were discovered and reported by Andrew Bartlett of Catalyst IT. ¬† Microsoft‚Äôs Active Directory is an identity and access management service that runs on Windows Server.¬†While the tech giant rated the shortcomings as ‚Äúexploitation less likely‚Äù in its assessment, the public disclosure of the PoC has prompted renewed calls for applying the fixes to mitigate any potential exploitation. ( CVE-2021-42278) allows an attacker to manipulate the SAM-Account-Name attribute, which is used to log a user into systems in the Active Directory domain; CVE-2021-42287 allows the attacker to impersonate the domain controller. In other words, a bad actor with domain user credentials can gain access as a domain admin user.¬†¬†‚ÄúAn attacker may establish a clear path to a Domain Admin user in an Active Directory environment that hasn‚Äôt implemented these new patches by combining these two vulnerabilities,‚Äù Microsoft‚Äôs senior product manager Daniel Naim explained. ‚ÄúAfter compromising an ordinary user in the domain, attackers can simply raise their privilege to that of a Domain Admin using this escalation technique.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Imagine launching your product or service online, and everything&amp;rsquo;s going great-until a traffic spike occurs. Suddenly, your website crashes, and your customers can&amp;rsquo;t access your offerings. What happened? The culprit is most probably poor web architecture that wasn&amp;rsquo;t built for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You understand the frustration firsthand if you have ever been caught in the chaos of website crashes or poor performance during peak traffic times. What if I told you, however, that by using the right approach to scalable web architecture, you can prevent these issues and build a website that will grow with your business? Your customers&amp;rsquo; experience will always be smooth, no matter how big you get.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s CVERC attempts to attribute Volt Typhoon activities to the U.S., but the fact-free claims reveal much about the PRC&amp;rsquo;s real agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The latest CVERC report reflects China‚Äôs ongoing efforts to undermine support for U.S. surveillance activities by attempting to fuel debate over Section 702.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The CVERC report also draws Microsoft into its crosshairs as part of an ongoing push to remove foreign technology from PRC government systems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The report highlights previous intelligence from France and Germany regarding U.S spying in an attempt to deflect attention away from recent incidents of Chinese espionage in Europe, likely as a means to shape narratives amid ongoing political debates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;China‚Äôs Computer Virus Emergency Response Center has released part three of a running series claiming that the U.S. government is actually behind Volt Typhoon activity, rather than China. The latest CVERC report, whose front page includes an oddly edited photo with the text ‚ÄúLie to Me,‚Äù provides no new evidence of these claims and rehashes old leaked U.S. intelligence documents. However, this CVERC report is not useless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cybersecurity, vulnerability management is one of the older technologies that still play a critical role in securing our assets. It is often overlooked, disregarded, or considered only for checkbox compliance needs, but a proper vulnerability management program can play a critical role in avoiding a series of data breaches. CIS Control 07 provides the minimum requirements and table stakes, if you will, for establishing a successful vulnerability management program.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer simplifies inspecting unused access to guide you towards least privilege.¬†You can use unused access findings to identify over-permissive access¬†granted to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users in your accounts or organization. From a delegated administrator account for IAM Access Analyzer, you can use the dashboard to review unused access findings across your organization and prioritize the accounts to inspect based on the volume and type of findings. The findings highlight unused roles, unused access keys for IAM users, and unused passwords for IAM users. For active IAM users and roles, the findings provide visibility into unused services and actions. Recently, IAM Access Analyzer launched new configuration capabilities that you can use to customize the analysis. You can select accounts, roles, and users to exclude, and focus on the areas that matter the most to you. You can use identifiers such as account ID or scale configuration using tags. By scoping the¬†IAM Access Analyzer¬†to monitor a subset of accounts and roles, you can reduce noise from unwanted findings. You can update the configuration when needed to change the scope of analysis. With this new offering, IAM Access Analyzer provides enhanced controls to help you tailor the analysis more closely to your organization‚Äôs security needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SentinelLabs has identified multiple deceptive websites linked to businesses in China fronting for North Korea&amp;rsquo;s fake IT workers scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs has identified unique characteristics of multiple websites, now seized by the US Government, associated with the DPRK IT Worker front companies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We assess with high confidence that DPRK actors seek to impersonate US based software and technology consulting businesses by copying the online brands of legitimate organizations, seeking to use these for financial objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs has linked the activity to several active front companies and links these with high confidence to a larger set of organizations being created in China.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Our findings link additional companies, which remain active today, to the DPRK IT Workers scheme.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;North Korea operates a global network of IT workers, both as individuals and under front companies, to evade sanctions and generate revenue for the regime. These workers are highly skilled in areas like software development, mobile applications, blockchain, and cryptocurrency technologies. By posing as professionals from other countries using fake identities and forged credentials, they secure remote jobs and freelance contracts with businesses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By tilting the discs, one controls which edge is in contact with the object, which in turn controls the direction the object moves. While the concept is straightforward, the implementation is a wee bit more complex. LEGO pieces offer a rich variety of mechanical functions, but even so, making a 9√ó9 array of discs all rotate in unison turns out to be a nontrivial problem to solve. Gears alone are not the answer, because the shafts in such a dense array are a bit too close for LEGO gears to play nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about working in quantum computing is being exposed to a whole new set of skills and tools. For those of us coming from the software engineering side, discovering the things our academic peers are using is an interesting experience. One of the best for me personally was coming across the Julia programming language, and learning why it has become the go-to language for serious scientific programming in some circles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cristina Cifuentes, known as the Mother of Decompilation, reflects on three decades of innovation in reverse engineering in her LABScon 2024 keynote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Cristina Cifuentes worked on a machine code interpreter for the Modula-2 programming language as part of her Compilers project. That summer, she integrated it into a mixed GPM Modula-2 compiler/interpreter for the 8086 processor. This gave her hands-on experience with assembly language and the process of converting intermediate representations into executable code, laying the groundwork for her later research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Binarly‚Äôs Alex Matrosov and Fabio Pagani present PKfail, a firmware supply-chain security issue affecting major device vendors and hundreds of device models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern computing heavily relies on establishing and maintaining trust, which begins with trusted foundations and extends through operating systems and applications in a chain-like manner. This ensures that end users can confidently rely on the integrity of the underlying hardware, firmware, and software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most prevalent mechanisms for enforcing trust in the UEFI firmware ecosystem is Secure Boot, which ensures that only digitally signed and verified software is executed during the system boot process, safeguarding against attacks on ‚Äúexternal‚Äù firmware components and boot loaders. A key component of Secure Boot is the Platform Key (PK), the root-of-trust key used for managing the cryptographic material that validates external components and bootloaders before execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/on-log4j-vulnerability-cisa-fbi-and-nsa-publish-a-joint-advisory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, U.S., and U.K. cyber security agencies released a joint advisory on Wednesday in response to the widespread exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in Apache‚Äôs Log4j software library by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThese vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, are severe,‚Äù the intelligence agencies stated in the new guidance. Cyber threat actors are actively scanning networks for vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021-45105. These vulnerabilities will likely be exploited over an extended period. Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2021-45046, on the other hand, allows remote code execution in certain non-default configurations, while CVE-2021-45105 could be used by a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure to target large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From late June to mid-July 2024, a suspected China-nexus threat actor targeted large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe, an activity cluster that we dubbed ‚ÄòOperation Digital Eye‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The intrusions could have enabled the adversaries to establish strategic footholds and compromise downstream entities. SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Our visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
