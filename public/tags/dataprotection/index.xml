      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eight technologies developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, either wholly or in collaboration with researchers from other organizations, were among the winners of the 2020 R&amp;amp;D 100 Awards. Annually since 1963, these international R&amp;amp;D awards recognize 100 technologies that a panel of expert judges selects as the most revolutionary of the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Six of the laboratory‚Äôs winning technologies are software systems, a number of which take advantage of artificial intelligence techniques. The software technologies are solutions to difficulties inherent in analyzing large volumes of data and to problems in maintaining cybersecurity. Another technology is a process designed to assure secure fabrication of integrated circuits, and the eighth winner is an optical communications technology that may enable future space missions to transmit error-free data to Earth at significantly higher rates than currently possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta we are building a privacy-first alternative to big tech offerings so that everyone can protect their data online by sending encrypted emails and sharing encrypted events with Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar. This brings our service to the forefront of all kinds of adversaries. As a consequence, Tuta is regularly being attacked with DDoS attacks. While most of the times, we can fend off these attacks without you noticing, the adversaries changed their attack vectors beginning of December which led to several downtimes during the first week of December. We have now immensely improved our DDoS-protection methods and our systems are capable of fending off these attacks. Now, we would like explain what happened and how we mitigated the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areg Danagoulian, associate professor in the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, has built a career around nuclear detection technology. His work has focused, among other things, on a system that could greatly improve the current process for verifying compliance of nuclear warheads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier this year, he published new work on physical cryptographic nuclear warhead verification and on active detection of shielded nuclear materials in journals including&lt;/em&gt; Nature Communications &lt;em&gt;and the&lt;/em&gt; Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. &lt;em&gt;He has also received a pair of prestigious accolades: a radiation science and technology award from the American Nuclear Society and the honor of being named, along with his team, as the 2019 Arms Control Association (ACA) Arms Control Persons of the Year.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThis innovation paves the way for more effective arms control agreements, inspections, and enforcement,&amp;quot; said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the ACA. &amp;ldquo;Professor Danagoulian‚Äôs MIT team has brought the best science to arms control and provided a creative solution that can reduce nuclear threats and enhance security.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ron Rivest is an MIT Institute Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He‚Äôs an authority on algorithms and an inventor of the RSA public-key cryptosystem, one of the most widely used algorithms to securely transmit data. Since the 1980s, he‚Äôs taught students how to use cryptography to help secure voting systems. Then, in 2000, an historic recount in Florida determined the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, and the Caltech / MIT Voting Technology Project was founded with the mission to secure future elections, pulling in Rivest, who has been involved since, as well as other MIT faculty from the Department of Political Science and the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta we fight for your right to privacy with encryption. But the EU is still discussing policies and law enforcement demands that threaten to break encryption. If the EU continues down this path, we at Tuta are given two choices - compromise our quantum-safe encryption, or relocate to a region that values and safeguards digital privacy. The answer for us is easy. We&amp;rsquo;d rather leave the EU than break our open source encryption. Now we have signed an open letter and together with more than 50 organizations and companies we call on the EU to uphold strong encryption and privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No one likes ads, but the free Gmail - a very popular email provider - continues to ignore its users demands at this crucial point. While seemingly the perfect email solution with lots of features and plenty of storage, Gmail shows more advertisements to its users than most email services. This advertising must be stopped!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1994, as Professor Peter Shor PhD ‚Äô85 tells it, internal seminars at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs were lively affairs. The audience of physicists was an active and inquisitive bunch, often pelting speakers with questions throughout their talks. Shor, who worked at Bell Labs at the time, remembers several occasions when a speaker couldn‚Äôt get past their third slide, as they attempted to address a rapid line of questioning before their time was up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is updating SymCrypt, its core cryptographic library, with new quantum-secure algorithms. Microsoft‚Äôs details are here. From a news article:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first new algorithm Microsoft added to SymCrypt is called ML-KEM. Previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, ML-KEM is one of three post-quantum standards formalized last month by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The KEM in the new name is short for key encapsulation. KEMs can be used by two parties to negotiate a shared secret over a public channel. Shared secrets generated by a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic operations, which aren‚Äôt vulnerable to Shor‚Äôs algorithm when the keys are of a sufficient size&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strategic use of data is vital for progress in science, commerce, and even politics, but at the same time, citizens are demanding more responsible, respectful use of personal data. Internet users have never felt more helpless about how their data are being used: Surveys show that the vast majority of U.S. adults feel that they have little to no control over the data that the government and private companies collect about them. In response to these concerns, new privacy laws are being enacted in Europe, California, Virginia, and elsewhere around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Academic digital credentials ‚Äî the cryptographically verifiable assertion that an individual holds a degree, certificate, or other credential ‚Äî have been available for the better part of a decade. Yet despite the potential value of these data-rich, transportable credentials to graduates, employers, and academic institutions, digital credentials have by no means become the standard in presenting or verifying skills and qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A new report from the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), housed at MIT Open Learning, explores this gap between the promise of digital credentials and their widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most recent email you sent was likely encrypted using a tried-and-true method that relies on the idea that even the fastest computer would be unable to efficiently break a gigantic number into factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers, on the other hand, promise to rapidly crack complex cryptographic systems that a classical computer might never be able to unravel. This promise is based on a quantum factoring algorithm proposed in 1994 by Peter Shor, who is now a professor at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Tuta our focus is to keep our users&amp;rsquo; data secure with quantum-safe encryption. To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But do people today know the perfect password length?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As quantum computing leapfrogs at great speed, the spotlight is now on post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Recently, NIST released the first three PQC encryption algorithm standards, urging organizations to test the new algorithms and prepare their cryptographic infrastructures for the inevitable shift to quantum-resistant methods. This push for PQC readiness is driven by a growing concern [‚Ä¶]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post What You Need to Know About ‚ÄúHarvest-Now, Decrypt-Later‚Äù Attacks appeared first on Security Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese attackers have infiltrated more than a dozen US telecom providers such as AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile to monitor US officials, and even politicians like Trump and Harris. The FBI detected this attack by Salt Typhoon months ago, but still can not get the attackers out of the systems. Now, America&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Defence Agency (CISA) calls on everyone to use end-to-end encryption. This is proof that backdoors to encryption must never be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
