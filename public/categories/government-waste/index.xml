      <description>&lt;p&gt;The offices where Washington D.C.’s bureaucrats work were largely empty on Monday, January 20, 2025, as Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. President for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But they weren’t empty for the inauguration. Because that Monday coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day federal holiday, most U.S. government employees had a paid day off work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then, many of the federal government’s buildings continued to sit empty on Tuesday, January 21, and again on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
