      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla remains committed to fostering a secure, agile, and transparent Web PKI ecosystem. The new Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) v3.0, effective March 15, 2025, introduces critical updates to strengthen Certificate Authority (CA) practices and enhance compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A major focus of &lt;strong&gt;MRSP v3.0&lt;/strong&gt; is tackling the long-standing challenge of &lt;strong&gt;delayed certificate revocation&lt;/strong&gt;—an issue that has historically weakened the security and reliability of TLS certificate management. The updated policy establishes &lt;strong&gt;clearer revocation expectations, improved incident reporting, subscriber education by CAs, revocation planning,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automated certificate issuance&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that certificate replacement and revocation can be handled promptly and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, browser security is a critical mission, and part of that mission involves responding swiftly to new threats. Tuesday, around 8 AM Eastern time, we received a heads-up from the Anti-Virus company ESET, who alerted us to a Firefox exploit that had been spotted in the wild. We want to give a huge thank you to ESET for sharing their findings with us—it’s collaboration like this that keeps the web a safer place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Firefox will upgrade more Mixed Content in Version 127</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the web already supports HTTPS: In fact, 93% of requests made by Firefox are already HTTPS. As a reminder, HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) fixes the security shortcoming of HTTP by creating a secure and encrypted connection. Oftentimes, when web applications enable encryption with HTTPS on their servers, legacy content may still contain references using HTTP, even though that content would also be available over a secure and encrypted connection. When such a document gets loaded over HTTPS but subresources like images, audio and video are loaded using HTTP, it is referred to as “mixed content”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
