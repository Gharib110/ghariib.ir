This report includes two new metrics: SSE/SASE Threat Prevention and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs). Miercom’s independent, head-to-head stress testing establishes how well a platform can detect and block the latest generations of cyber security threats in real-world scenarios. Blocking at least 99% of cyber attacks is a key objective, because even a 90% block rate can translate to hundreds of costly attacks. Organizations subject to these attacks can face data loss, credential theft, ransomware demands, and […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Each deployed security tool is designed to provide a specific type of protection across different areas like the network, endpoints, email, and cloud environments. This hybrid methodology, often requiring dozens of systems, leads to several security and operational challenges for security operations center (SOC) and network operations center (NOC) teams. Adopting a hybrid environment is unavoidable, and Gartner[1] anticipates that “By 2025, over 50% of network firewall deployments will involve more than two deployment factors from the same vendor — up from less than 10% in 2023.” [1]  While the benefits of this new ecosystem are […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Autonomous cyber security represents a bold, transformative leap into the future—where intelligent, AI-driven systems operate at the edge of innovation, detecting, preventing, and responding to threats with unparalleled precision. This journey is more than technological advancement—it is a paradigm shift. By creating systems that think, reason, and act autonomously, organizations are poised to outpace adversaries and redefine what it means to be secure in an increasingly digitized world. The further along this journey […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
