<p>You know that “Hi, how are you?” text from a stranger? It’s one of the top scams worldwide—right along with those fake delivery notices that try to reel you in a scam site with a fishy link. Now you have extra protection against them and all other kinds of scams with our new McAfee Scam Detector.</p>
<p>The time’s right for it too. Those scam stats above came from our latest research, which also uncovered just how often people get hit with scams and how costly they can be. 59% of Americans said they or someone they know has fallen for an online scam in the last 12 months, with scam victims losing an average of $1,471 to the scam.</p>
<p>Now here’s where our Scam Detector comes in. It helps stop scammers in their tracks with real-time protection against fake emails, suspicious texts, and deepfake videos that look incredibly real. By design, it helps you protect what scammers want — your money and your personal info.</p>
<h2 id="how-mcafee-scam-detector-suite-works"><strong>How McAfee Scam Detector Suite works</strong></h2>
<p>McAfee Scam Detector starts with McAfee Smart AI, the same technology that already powers our online protection. From there, it helps keep you safe from email, text message, and video scams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Scam Detector:</strong> Detects suspect texts that scammers use to trick you into giving them money, flags messages with risky links, before you open them, and gives you clear explanations of why they’re dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Email Scam Detector:</strong> Checks your inbox for suspicious emails and flags risky messages before you even open them. It also explains why a message is dangerous, so you’ll know what to look out for next time.</li>
<li><strong>Deepfake Detector:</strong> Spots AI-made videos, letting you know if something you’re watching may not be what it seems. Whether it’s someone pretending to be your boss or a fake celebrity endorsement, Scam Detector Suite makes sure you don’t get fooled.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part is that we do this automatically. Once it’s set up, McAfee Scam Detector goes to work immediately. No need to copy, paste, or second-guess if a message is fake — we take care of it all for you, all in real-time. If we spot something sketchy, it lets you know, whether that’s on your mobile app, email inbox, or video platform.</p>
<p>Also, it lets you know what’s suspicious and why. That’s important to us. When it comes to scams, “knowing one when you see one” goes a long way toward keeping yourself safer online. Explaining why something’s dangerous can help you spot threats even when you’re on devices without McAfee-powered protection.</p>
<p>Soon, McAfee Scam Detector will be included in all McAfee+, McAfee Total Protection, and McAfee LiveSafe plans at no extra cost. It protects you wherever you’re online. Whether you’re using a phone, laptop, tablet, or Chromebook, our Scam Detector Suite keeps you safe.</p>
