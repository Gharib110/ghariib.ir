<p><strong>Published on</strong>: 2024-12-28T00:33:00Z</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: While playing a game on my Windows PC, my Dell laptop flashed the BSOD &quot;Kernel Security Check Failure&quot; before restarting. Upon restart, it started a BIOS update. The BIOS update was weird &ndash; the screen flashed and flickered, there were weird artifacts, and it just hung without completing. I was unable to turn it off with the power button. The battery eventually died on the laptop and so it shut down. I removed the new RAM, turned it on. Luckily there was a back up BIOS on board so it went through some recovery process and booted. Previous to all of this, I had upgraded the RAM in the laptop by adding a new stick but also keeping the old one in. The sticks were not matched &ndash; based on some internet research I see it as possible that some timing issue occurred. The game wasnt that demanding of system resources, but it seems possible to me. My question is the following: Was this likely to have been malware or caused by RAM issues? The BIOS update concerns me. If it was likely to be malware, what should I do to make sure it is clean? The computer has been sitting a few months until I had some time to deal with it properly.</p>
