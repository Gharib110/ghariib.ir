<p><strong>Published on</strong>: 2024-12-28T14:24:50Z</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Ive noticed that many services dont specify the purpose behind verification codes. For example when signing up to a service, we often want/need to verify that the email address or phone number is indeed ours. We might also need to verify via email/sms as a second factor if that is what they offer in the form of 2FA. The email/sms sent to the address/number is often phrased as &quot;Here is your verification code: XXXXXX&quot; instead of &quot;Here is the code to register your account with this email address&quot; or &quot;Here is the code to verify the new sign in attempt&quot;. Is there a security reason to not specify this? Since it seems that knowing the purpose behind the code would be a better user experience. One example of a service that doesnt hide the purpose behind the code is the Microsoft Authenticator app, it asks &quot;Approve sign in?&quot; etc. But maybe they have a different approach due to the increased security of 2FA apps compared to email/sms based 2FA? Edit: I should clarify the reason why I thought there might be a security aspect here. I was drawing a parallel to the error text one gets when signing in, its nearly always &quot;Incorrect credentials&quot; rather than &quot;Incorrect username&quot; or &quot;Incorrect password&quot;. In that case it can be seen as good practice to not specify exactly which part is incorrectly entered, since even the sign-in username or email might be private information.</p>
