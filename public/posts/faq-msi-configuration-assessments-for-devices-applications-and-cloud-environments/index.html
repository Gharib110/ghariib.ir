<p>We get a lot of questions about configuration reviews, so we built this FAQ document to help folks learn more. Here are the most common questions:</p>

<h2 id="general-questions">General Questions</h2>
<p>1. What is an MSI configuration assessment?<br>
An MSI (Managed Security Infrastructure) configuration assessment evaluates the security posture of devices, applications, and cloud environments. It ensures that configurations align with best practices, compliance requirements, and industry security standards.</p>
<p>2. Why do I need a configuration assessment?<br>
Misconfigured systems are a leading cause of security breaches. An assessment helps identify vulnerabilities, enforce security controls, and reduce risk exposure by ensuring that all configurations adhere to security best practices.</p>
<p>3. How often should configuration assessments be performed?<br>
Regular assessments should be conducted at least annually or whenever significant changes occur (e.g., system updates, new deployments, or security incidents). For high-risk environments, quarterly reviews may be necessary.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-coverage">Scope and Coverage</h2>
<p>4. What types of devices are assessed?<br>
The assessment includes:<br>
– Workstations (desktops, laptops)<br>
– Servers (on-premise and cloud-based)<br>
– Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets)<br>
– Network equipment (firewalls, routers, switches)<br>
– Security devices (IDS/IPS, SIEM, VPNs)</p>
<p>5. What applications are included in the assessment?<br>
– Enterprise applications (ERP, CRM, HR systems)<br>
– Cloud-based applications (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS)<br>
– Web applications and APIs<br>
– Databases<br>
– Custom-built software</p>
<p>6. What cloud environments do you assess?<br>
We assess public, private, and hybrid cloud environments, including:<br>
– AWS, Azure, Google Cloud<br>
– SaaS platforms (Microsoft 365, Salesforce, etc.)<br>
– Virtualization platforms and containers (VMware, Docker, Kubernetes)</p>
<h2 id="assessment-process">Assessment Process</h2>
<p>7. How is the assessment conducted?<br>
The assessment involves:<br>
– Reviewing system configurations and settings<br>
– Comparing configurations against security benchmarks (e.g., CIS, NIST, ISO 27001)<br>
– Identifying misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and security gaps<br>
– Providing remediation recommendations</p>
<p>8. Do you perform automated or manual assessments?<br>
A combination of both is used. Automated tools scan for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, while manual analysis ensures accuracy, evaluates complex settings, and validates findings.</p>
<p>9. Will the assessment impact business operations?<br>
No. The assessment is non-intrusive and performed with minimal disruption. In cases where changes are necessary, they are recommended but not enforced during the assessment.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance</h2>
<p>10. What security frameworks and compliance standards are covered?<br>
– CIS Benchmarks<br>
– NIST Cybersecurity Framework<br>
– ISO 27001<br>
– PCI DSS<br>
– HIPAA<br>
– SOC 2<br>
– Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) guidelines</p>
<p>11. Will this help with compliance audits?<br>
Yes. A configuration assessment ensures that security controls are in place, reducing audit findings and non-compliance risks.</p>
<h2 id="findings-and-remediation">Findings and Remediation</h2>
<p>12. What happens after the assessment?<br>
You receive a detailed report outlining:<br>
– Identified misconfigurations and risks<br>
– Recommended remediation steps<br>
– Prioritized action plan for improvements</p>
<p>13. Do you help with remediation?<br>
Yes. We provide guidance and support for implementing recommended changes, ensuring a secure configuration.</p>
<h2 id="cost-and-scheduling">Cost and Scheduling</h2>
<p>14. How much does an MSI configuration assessment cost?<br>
Cost varies based on scope, environment size, and complexity. Contact us for a customized quote.</p>
<p>15. How can I schedule an assessment?<br>
Reach out via email, phone, or our website to discuss your requirements and schedule an assessment.</p>
