<p><strong>Summary</strong>: With all currently ongoing global conflicts in the world, I was thinking about removing default trusted certificate authorities root certificates that are from countries that are (no longer) considered trusted for example due to sanctions, war, boycot or other reasons. I understand there is a somewhat global consensus about which are trusted and which are not, and mechanisms for expiration, revocation et cetera. However, I dont see why we should consider any certificate signed in those countries as trusted. I have to check if default trusted CAs are actually different on Linux, Mac or Windows systems but I expect little difference. Also, I have no idea yet of which countries are actually trusted in terms of CAs right now. I can imagine that this can be achieved on all clients by simple inspecting all CA certificates and removing them from the store if they contain such country. Is this a common practise and why (not)? Besides the obvious are there other up- or downsides of doing this?</p>
