<p><strong>Published on</strong>: 2024-12-28T01:10:56Z</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Alice stated to Bob that X is her physical fingerprint. Problem:  How to make Bob trust that X is really a physical fingerprint of Alice? How to prevent Alice from creating multiple identities (lets assume she has only one physical finger)?  What is the best protocol (rule or set that has been defined and agreed between two parties) to solve these problems without any third party? I think there must be rigorous and layered protocol to define them so it can be fair for both parties. First, I need to define the axiom: A physical fingerprint is the lifetime hash. My main concern is about the physical layer, where the data source needs to be validated and verified. Here, if multiple vendors of hardware scanners are using different technologies, implementations, and standards, does it produce different results of raw fingerprints when they are digitized into binary data? Even though in reality, physical fingerprints never change. Moreover, vendor means a third party. So does it mean a pattern recognition algorithm that has been agreed upon by both parties must be involved?Then after X is classified as valid fingerprint input and reported to Bob, X is performing digital hash. But then the produced hash will be dynamic values whenever Alice perform validation, which makes Alice possible to create multiple identities, thus its hard to answer the second problem.</p>
