			<h1>Ransomware threat mailed in letters to business owners</h1>

				<p>Business owners and CEOs across the United States received customized ransomware threats this month from the most unusual of places—letters in the mail.</p>
<p>The letters, which were first reported by multiple cybersecurity researchers, claim to come from a ransomware group called BianLian. But since Malwarebytes first started tracking BianLian nearly one year ago, our intelligence analysts have never seen the cybercriminal gang resort to sending physical letters to make their ransom demands, suggesting that the latest snail mail campaign could be the work of copycats.</p>
<p>The threat, however, is still quite real, especially for small business owners who rely either on themselves or contracted IT services to investigate any technical problems.</p>
<p>According to multiple examples discovered by researchers, the letters in this likely hollow threat were sent through the US Postal Service. The envelopes containing the letters are stamped with the words “TIME SENSITIVE READ IMMEDIATELY” and have the following return address listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BianLian Group<br>
24 Federal St, Suite 100<br>
Boston, MA, 02110</p></blockquote>
<p>The letters themselves lobby a variety of urgent threats to their recipients: Their corporate network has been compromised, sensitive customer and employee data has been stolen, and there is immediately a 10-day deadline to pay a cryptocurrency ransom before the cybercriminals leak the stolen data online.</p>
<p>These threats are standard for ransomware groups today, especially those that have pivoted to not only encrypting a company’s data, but stealing it in the process of an attack to use as further leverage to extort a ransom payment. In fact last year, Malwarebytes wrote about BianLian abusing a common Microsoft tool to avoid cybersecurity detection while storing massive quantities of stolen data from victims.</p>
<p>But the similarities between the threats included in the letter and the recorded actions of BianLian end there. The letter senders claim that they “no longer negotiate with victims,” which is a rarity from ransomware gangs. In fact, the practice is so normalized that a cottage industry of ransomware “negotiators” has popped up to help victims caught in an attack. The letters themselves, researchers said, also include few grammatical errors and better sentence structure than a typical BianLian ransomware note.</p>
<p>One of the letters, in full, begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear [REDACTED]</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that we have gained access to [REDACTED] systems and over the past several weeks have exported thousands of data files, including customer order and contact information, employee information with IDs, SSNs, payroll reports, and other sensitive HR documents, company financial documents, legal documents, investor and shareholder information, invoices, and tax documents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, researchers noticed that some of the letters were customized based on their recipient. If a letter was sent to a healthcare CEO, for instance, the letter warned about the theft of patient data; if the letter was sent to a CEO of a product maker, the letter warned about breached customer orders and employee data.</p>
<p>The amounts demanded by the letters varied reportedly from $250,000 to $350,000.</p>
<p>While a “physical” cyberthreat may sound silly, these letters could cause significant harm to small and growing businesses.</p>
<p>These personalized letters convincingly threaten network compromise, password abuse, employee exploitation, and data theft, which can be difficult to verify for any lean organization. Think about it this way: If an everyday person would struggle to check whether their home router had been compromised, many small business owners would struggle to do the same regarding their corporate infrastructure, and that’s through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>If you receive one of these letters in the mail, notify your IT or security team immediately. They can provide the investigation necessary to verify the security of your business.</p>
<p>Whether you have dedicated IT staff or not, you can protect your small business with Malwarebytes Teams, which prevents malware attacks and notifies you about suspicious activity on your network.</p>
