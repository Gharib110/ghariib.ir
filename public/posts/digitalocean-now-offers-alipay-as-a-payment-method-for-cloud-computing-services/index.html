				<p>At DigitalOcean, we’re dedicated to making cloud infrastructure easy and accessible to developers everywhere. In effort of this and to support our global community, we are thrilled to announce that DigitalOcean now accepts Alipay as a payment method for any and all DigitalOcean services and products. This addition will help to enable more customers, especially those in Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions, to conveniently pay for cloud computing services on our platform.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-alipay">What is Alipay?</h2>
<p>Alipay is a digital wallet and mobile payment app that allows users to make payments online with stored debit and credit card details to make online purchases from their phones. In addition to offering mobile payment services, the app offers wealth management services and a number of security features, including two-factor authentication, real-time risk monitoring, and messaging encryption.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-use-alipay-for-when-it-comes-to-digitalocean">What can I use Alipay for when it comes to DigitalOcean?</h2>
<p>The short answer: everything. The long answer is, with Alipay now available as a payment method on DigitalOcean, you can use it to pay for any of DigitalOcean’s cloud services, including GPU Droplets, Managed Databases, App Platform, and more. This addition offers a convenient and familiar billing option for users who rely on Alipay, simplifying the way you manage payments for your cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="how-alipay-benefits-digitalocean-customers">How Alipay benefits DigitalOcean customers</h2>
<p>According to multiple sources, Alipay is by far one of the most, if not the most popular payment method in Asia-Pacific regions, specifically China. With DigitalOcean now accepting Alipay as a payment method, you can see the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Streamline billing for your cloud infrastructure:</strong> Prior to Alipay not being available on DigitalOcean, perhaps your cloud computing purchases were made through different payment methods. Now, you can consolidate your cloud bill all to one place, and keep your charges all on one app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased payment security:</strong> Alipay offers several security features such as two-factor authentication and EasySafePay to help keep your payment data secure when you are paying your DigitalOcean cloud bill every month. This compliments our security standards, which you can read more about here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elimination of barriers to DigitalOcean products and services:</strong> By offering a familiar, widely used, and trusted payment method, DigitalOcean helps eliminate some of the barriers associated with international transactions. With Alipay now supported on our platform, you can seamlessly use your preferred payment method for our products and services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The addition of Alipay as a payment method for DigitalOcean marks an important step in making our cloud services more accessible to customers worldwide. We’re passionate about enabling developers to focus on building and scaling their applications, and partnering with Alipay helps us achieve that goal. We’re dedicated to enhancing your experience on DigitalOcean and invite you to take advantage of the convenience Alipay offers in managing your cloud infrastructure…</p>
