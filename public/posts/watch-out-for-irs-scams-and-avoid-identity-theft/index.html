<p>Tax season isn’t just busy for taxpayers—it’s prime time for scammers, too. As you gather your W-2s, 1099s, and other tax documents, cybercriminals are gearing up to exploit the flood of personal and financial data in circulation. From phishing emails posing as the IRS to fake tax preparers looking to steal your refund, these scams can lead to identity theft, fraudulent tax returns, and serious financial headaches. </p>
<p>The good news? IRS scams follow predictable patterns, and with a little awareness, you can spot the warning signs before falling victim. Let’s break down the most common tax scams and how you can safeguard your personal information this filing season. </p>
<h2 id="impersonation-schemes">Impersonation Schemes</h2>
<p>A commonly used tactic involves hackers posing as collectors from the IRS, as tax preparers, or government bureaus. This tactic is pretty effective due to Americans’ concerns about misfiling their taxes or accidentally running into trouble with the IRS. Scammers take advantage of this fear, manipulating innocent users into providing sensitive information or money over the phone or by email. And in extreme cases, hackers may be able to infect computers with malware via malicious links or attachments sent through IRS email scams.</p>
<h2 id="robocalls">Robocalls</h2>
<p>Another tactic used to take advantage of taxpayers is the canceled social security number scam. Hackers use robocalls claiming that law enforcement will suspend or cancel the victim’s Social Security number in response to taxes owed. Often, victims are scared into calling the fraudulent numbers back and persuaded into transferring assets to accounts that the scammer controls. Users need to remember that the IRS will only contact taxpayers through snail mail or in person, not over the phone.</p>
<h2 id="emails">Emails</h2>
<p>Another scam criminals use involves emails impersonating the IRS. Victims receive a phishing email claiming to be from the IRS, reminding them to file their taxes or offering them information about their tax refund via malicious links. If a victim clicks on the link, they will be redirected to a spoofed site that collects the victim’s personal data, facilitating identity theft. What’s more, a victim’s computer can become infected with malware if they click on a link with malicious code, allowing fraudsters to steal more data.</p>
<h2 id="phony-cpas">Phony CPAs</h2>
<p>Scammers also take advantage of the fact that many users seek out the help of a tax preparer or CPA during this time. These criminals will often pose as professionals, accepting money to complete a user’s taxes but won’t sign the return. This makes it look like the user completed the return themselves. However, these ghost tax preparers often lie on the return to make the user qualify for credits they haven’t earned or apply changes that will get them in trouble. Since the scammers don’t sign, the victim will then be responsible for any errors. This could lead to the user having to repay money owed, or potentially lead to an audit.</p>
<p>While these types of scams can occur at any time of the year, they are especially prevalent leading up to the April tax filing due date. Consumers need to be on their toes during tax season to protect their personal information and keep their finances secure. To avoid being spoofed by scammers and identity thieves, follow these tips:</p>
<p><strong>File before cybercriminals do it for you.</strong> The easiest defense you can take against tax seasons schemes is to get your hands on your W-2 and file as soon as possible. The more prompt you are to file, the less likely your data will be raked in by a cybercriminal.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on your credit and your identity.</strong> Keeping tabs on your credit report and knowing if your personal information has been compromised in some way can help prevent tax fraud. Together, they can let you know if someone has stolen your identity or if you have personal info on the dark web that could lead to identity theft.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our credit monitoring servicecan keep an eye on changes to your credit score, report, and accounts with timely notifications and guidance so you can take action to tackle identity theft.</li>
<li>Our identity monitoring servicechecks the dark web for your personal info, including email, government IDs, credit card and bank account info, and more—then provides alerts if your data is found on the dark web, an average of 10 months ahead of similar services.​</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beware of phishing attempts.</strong> It’s clear that phishing is the primary tactic crooks are leveraging this tax season, so it’s crucial you stay vigilant around your inbox. This means if any unfamiliar or remotely suspicious emails come through requesting tax data, double check their legitimacy with a manager or the security department before you respond. Remember: the IRS will not initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages, or social media channels to request personal or financial info. So someone contacts you that way, ignore the message.</p>
<p><strong>Watch out for spoofed websites.</strong> Scammers have extremely sophisticated tools that help disguise phony web addresses for DIY tax software, such as stolen company logos and site designs. To avoid falling for this, go directly to the source. Type the address of a website directly into the address bar of your browser instead of following a link from an email or internet search. If you receive any suspicious links in your email, investigating the domain is usually a good way to tell if the source is legitimate or not.</p>
<p><strong>Use a VPN, especially in public.</strong> Also known as a virtual private network, a VPN helps protect your vital personal info and other data with bank-grade encryption. The VPN encrypts your internet connection to keep your online activity private on any network, even public networks. Using a public network without a VPN can increase your risk because others on the network can potentially spy on your browsing and activity. If you’re new to the notion of using a VPN, check out this article on VPNs and how to choose one so that you can get the best protection and privacy possible. (Our McAfee+ plans offer a VPN as part of your subscription.)</p>
<p><strong>Protect yourself from scam messages.</strong> Scammers also send links to scam sites via texts, social media messages, and email. Text Scam Detector can help you spot if the message you got is a fake. It uses AI technology that automatically detects links to scam URLs. If you accidentally click, don’t worry, it can block risky sites if you do.</p>
<p><strong>Clean up your personal info online.</strong> Crooks and scammers have to find you before they can contact you. After all, they need to get your phone number or email from somewhere. Sometimes, that’s from “people finder” and online data brokers that gather and sell personal info to any buyer. Including crooks. McAfee Personal Data Cleanup can remove your personal info from the data broker sites scammers use to contact their victims.</p>
<p><strong>Consider an identity theft protection solution.</strong> If for some reason your personal data does become compromised, be sure to use an identity theft solution such as McAfee Identity Theft Protection, which allows users to take a proactive approach to protect their identities with personal and financial monitoring and recovery tools to help keep their identities personal and secured.</p>
