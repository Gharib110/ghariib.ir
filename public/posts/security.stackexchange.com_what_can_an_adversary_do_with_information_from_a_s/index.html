<p><strong>Published on</strong>: 2024-12-24T22:47:30Z</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Im looking at old receipts and Im wondering if need to shred them or if I can just toss them in the trash. Aside from standard information like date and time, my receipts contain the following information:  A reference number (this could be store specific) An AID number (application identifier; <a href="https://ambimat.com/developer-resources/list-of-application-identifiers-aid/">https://ambimat.com/developer-resources/list-of-application-identifiers-aid/</a>) A TC number (transaction cryptogram) Last four digits of the card (as communicated by the device or card network? Theyre not actually the same as my cards digits)  I tapped my phone to the point of sale using Apple Pay for all of these transactions. I understand that the AID number identifies the card network (VISA, MasterCard, etc). The TC number seems to be a one-time code generated as part of tokenization for a specific transaction. My guess is that the TC alone isnt of much use to an adversary since its a one-time code. If anything, it would probably need to be intercepted in real time. Possibly the combination of the above could be useful. Like, maybe an adversary could do a social-engineering attack and call the store or card network, provide all this information and then get the person on the other line to divulge additional information. So, is there an attack vector hiding in these receipts somewhere? Assume a threat actor of reasonable means, like someone whos dumpster diving; not a government.</p>
