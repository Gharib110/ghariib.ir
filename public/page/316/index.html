<p>Dynatrace is proud to be the first AWS global tech partner to offer <strong>ready-to-use CloudFormation templates</strong> for validating the Well-Architected pillars. The Dynatrace CloudFormation templates are now available in the <strong>AWS CloudFormation Public Extensions Registry</strong>, which makes Well-Architected validation even more accessible for AWS users.</p>
<p>Dynatrace and the AWS Well-Architected Framework ensure continuous optimization of cloud architecture, aligning with the key pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. Our previous blog post discussed the importance of integrating Dynatrace with the AWS Well-Architected Framework to enhance your software development lifecycle (SDLC). By leveraging Dynatrace Workflow Automation and the Site Reliability Guardian, organizations can ensure that their applications meet AWS’s best practices across all pillars.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/backstage-authentication-and-catalog-providers-a-practical-guide/">Backstage authentication and catalog providers: A practical guide</a></h1>
	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A previous article demonstrated how you can get an internal developer portal up and running with Backstage on Kubernetes in a few minutes using Red Hat Developer Hub on Red Hat OpenShift. That article configured Red Hat Developer Hub with a guest authentication provider–an acceptable option for experimentation, but unsuitable for production environments where developers are actively using the internal developer portal.</p>
<p>This article guides you through the process of configuring a production-ready authentication provider and a catalog provider to import catalog entities. Specifically, you’ll learn how to use GitHub as an authentication provider, and a GitHub organization as a source of truth for organization data to create user and group entities. </p>

<p>We found it nostalgic to watch [ve3iku] fire up an old Loran-A receiver and, as you can see in the video below, he got it working. If you aren’t familiar with LORAN, it was a common radio navigation technique before GPS took over everything.</p>
<p>LORAN — an acronym for Long Range Navigation — was a US byproduct of World War II and was similar in many ways to Britain’s Gee system. However, LORAN operated at lower frequencies to improve its range. It was instrumental in helping convoys cross the Atlantic and also found use in the Pacific theater.</p>

	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The debate over in-office versus remote work misses a fundamental truth: high-performing teams succeed based on how they’re organized, not where they sit. Through extensive research across industries, Gene Kim and Dr. Steven J. Spear found that three key mechanisms consistently enable team excellence: slowing down to speed up, breaking down complexity, and amplifying problems early.</p>
<p>As they explain in their award-winning book <em>Wiring the Winning Organization</em>, the leaders of the highest-performing teams will use these three simple mechanisms to “wire their organization for success instead of mediocrity.” </p>
