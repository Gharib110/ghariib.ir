<p>To keep up with the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, Aqua Nautilus researchers deploy honeypots that mimic real-world development environments. During a recent threat-hunting operation, they uncovered a surprising new attack vector: threat actors using misconfigured servers to hijack environments for streaming sports events. By exploiting misconfigured JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook applications, attackers drop live streaming capture tools and duplicate the broadcast on their illegal server, thus conducting stream ripping. In this blog, we explain how our threat hunting operation helped us uncover this and how we analyzed this attack using Aqua Tracee and Traceeshark.  </p>

<p>Long time no see, Aqua Nautilus researchers have identified a new campaign in the making by TeamTNT, a notorious hacking group. In this campaign, TeamTNT appears to be returning to its roots while preparing for a large-scale attack on cloud native environments. The group is currently targeting exposed Docker daemons to deploy Sliver malware, a cyber worm, and cryptominers, using compromised servers and Docker Hub as the infrastructure to spread their malware.  </p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>TikTok has requested an emergency injunction to stop or postpone the planned ban on the platform in the US.</p>
<p>Back in March, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would effectively ban TikTok from the US unless Chinese owner ByteDance agreed to give up its share of the immensely popular app.</p>
<p>TikTok claims this is censorship and collides with the principle of free speech. However, the company’s post on X got a lot of responses from people who feel TikTok itself banned them for no clear reason.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The US government launched a national security investigation into the popular, Chinese-owned router maker TP-Link, with a potential eye on banning the company’s devices in the United States.</p>
<p>The investigation comes amid heightened tension between the US and the Chinese government, and after a public letter from members of the US House of Representatives this summer that alleged that TP-Link was engaged in predatory pricing practices, driven by ulterior motives, and possibly sponsored by China. US officials noted how TP-Link undercut the competition on price to become the market leader for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network appliances.</p>

<p>The post Uncovering GStreamer secrets appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll show the results of my recent security research on GStreamer, the open source multimedia framework at the core of GNOME’s multimedia functionality.</p>
<p>I’ll also go through the approach I used to find some of the most elusive vulnerabilities, generating a custom input corpus from scratch to enhance fuzzing results.</p>

		<p>Cyber threats are more sophisticated, pervasive, and frequent than ever before. As a result, traditional methods for network security are becoming obsolete. These solutions simply cannot handle the extraordinary scale and complexity of network traffic inherent in modern IT environments. AI-driven solutions, however, can. How to Use AI for Network Security Modern networks generate a massive amount of data. Login attempts, device connections, data transfers, application access logs, and other such events contribute to massively complex environments. With so many events occurring simultaneously&hellip;</p>
