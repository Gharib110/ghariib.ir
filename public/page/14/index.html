		<p>During the forensic analysis of a mobile device, we often have the need to understand the content of a specific file or folder. This is particularly true when a file or a folder is not parsed by our set of tools. </p>
<p>Our approach is, typically, to start googling the file or folder name to check if someone else has already done some researches on it. This approach is time consuming and it&rsquo;s not always easy to quickly find the proper reference. I also realized that I googled the same file/folder name multiple times&hellip;..</p>

<p>Willkommen, meine Damen und Herren, zu unserem ersten Wettbewerb in Berlin! That’s correct (if Google translate didn’t steer me wrong). While the Pwn2Own competition started in Vancouver in 2007, we always want to ensure we are reaching the right people with our choice of venue. Over the last few years, the OffensiveCon conference in Berlin has emerged as one of the best offensive-focused events of the year. And while CanSecWest has been a great host over the years, it became apparent that perhaps it was time to relocate our spring event to a new home. With that, we are happy to announce that the enterprise-focused Pwn2Own event will take place on May 15-17, 2025, at the OffensiveCon conference in Berlin, Germany. While this event is currently sold out, we do have tickets available for competitors, and we believe the conference will also open a few more tickets for the public, too. The conference sold out its first run of tickets in under six hours, so it should be a fantastic crowd of some of the best vulnerability researchers in the world.</p>

		<p>Organizations today face an unprecedented challenge – managing complex security operations against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. While internal teams work tirelessly, the sheer scale and complexity of modern threats often exceed their capacity. Advanced security tools are crucial, but they&rsquo;re only part of the solution. What organizations need is a strategic partner, an expert guide to help navigate the intricacies of security operations, identify emerging risks and drive continuous improvement. In this high-stakes environment, success in cybersecurity isn&rsquo;t just about having the right technology; it&rsquo;s about combining tools with expertise to stay ahead of threats and protect critical assets.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In today’s complex cybersecurity landscape, organizations face an evolving array of threats that target the intersection of physical and digital domains. One technology gaining significant adoption in security-conscious environments is the <strong>antivirus kiosk</strong> – a dedicated physical station designed to scan, analyze, and sanitize external media before it connects to an organization’s network infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="the-blind-spot-in-traditional-security"><strong>The Blind Spot in Traditional Security</strong></h2>
<p>Most enterprise security frameworks focus primarily on network-based threats – phishing emails, malicious websites, and direct network intrusions. However, this approach overlooks a critical vulnerability: the physical introduction of digital threats through removable media such as USB drives, external hard disks, and memory cards.</p>

		<p>Hello Dev.to community!</p>
<p>ApostropheCMS 4.14.0 has been released. Check out an overview.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is also a full deep dive of the release on our blog</p>
<p>From enhanced table support in the rich-text editor to better piece management, this release brings several quality-of-life improvements for both developers and content managers.</p>
<h2 id="rich-text-improvements">Rich Text Improvements</h2>
<p>The heart of content creation in Apostrophe has always been our rich text editor, and with this release, it becomes even more powerful. We&rsquo;ve added the ability to generate tables from imported CSV files directly within the rich text widget. This allows content editors to quickly transform spreadsheet data into well-formatted web content.</p>

<p>In the beginning of February, Apple may have received a secret order requiring the company to create an encryption backdoor. According to a leak, the UK government demanded blanket, covert access to all sorts of encrypted data globally. After that demand, Apple decided to disable Advanced Data Protection for iCloud in the UK, issuing an official statement. What does that mean for the law enforcement, and what consequences are expected for the end users?</p>

		<p>How and why Android SafetyCore scans images on your smartphone — and how to remove it.</p>
<p>Since February, many users have been complaining about the Android System SafetyCore app suddenly appearing on their Android phones. It has neither UI nor settings, but Google Play says the developer is Google itself, the number of installations exceeds a billion, and the average rating is a dismal 2.4 stars. The purpose of the app is described vaguely: “It provides the underlying technology for features like the upcoming Sensitive Content Warnings feature in Google Messages”. It’s not hard to guess what “sensitive content” stands for, but how and why is Google going to be warning us about it? And how is it going to find out whether the content is indeed sensitive in nature?</p>
