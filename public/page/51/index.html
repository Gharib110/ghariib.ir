		<p>On most computers, there’s the feeling that there’s a one-to-one relationship between you and your operating system. You want to do a task, your operating system makes it possible by opening a window and launching an application. In IT, that balance doesn’t exist. Hundreds and thousands of tasks are required at any given moment. It’s up to the operating system to manage it, and it’s your job to manage the operating system. Amazingly, with the emergence of cloud computing, IT infrastructure is subject to even more demands than before. The operating system you choose essentially become</p>

		<p>In a post on r/RedditSafety by a Reddit administrator, the platform announced that it will start sending warnings to users that upvote violent content.</p>
<p>Reddit is a social media platform and online forum where users can share and discuss content across a wide range of topics. The platform’s structure divides it into communities known as “subreddits,” each focused on a specific subject or interest (from cars to movies to sports to knitting). Users can submit posts, which can be links, text, images, or videos, and other users can vote on these posts using “upvotes” or “downvotes.” The voting system determines the visibility of posts, with highly upvoted content appearing at the top of subreddits and potentially reaching the site’s front page.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Registration-Based Encryption in the Plain Model</strong><br>
<em>Jesko Dujmovic, Giulio Malavolta, Wei Qi</em></p>
<p>Registration-based encryption (RBE) is a recently developed alternative to identity-based encryption, that mitigates the well-known key-escrow problem by letting each user sample its own key pair. In RBE, the key authority is substituted by a key curator, a completely transparent entity whose only job is to reliably aggregate users&rsquo; keys. However, one limitation of all known RBE scheme is that they all rely on one-time trusted setup, that must be computed honestly. In this work, we ask whether this limitation is indeed inherent and we initiate the systematic study of RBE in the plain model, without any common reference string. We present the following main results: - (Definitions) We show that the standard security definition of RBE is unachievable without a trusted setup and we propose a slight weakening, where one honest user is required to be registered in the system. - (Constructions) We present constructions of RBE in the plain model, based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Along the way, we introduce the notions of non-interactive witness indistinguishable (NIWI) proofs secure against chosen statements attack and re-randomizable RBE, which may be of independent interest. A major limitation of our constructions, is that users must be updated upon every new registration. - (Lower Bounds) We show that this limitation is in some sense inherent. We prove that any RBE in the plain model that satisfies a certain structural requirement, which holds for all known RBE constructions, must update all but a vanishing fraction of the users, upon each new registration. This is in contrast with the standard RBE settings, where users receive a logarithmic amount of updates throughout the lifetime of the system.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This month is the five-year anniversary of the COVID-19 lockdowns in California. In March 2020, I was studying abroad in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I had heard rumors about lockdowns in the West, but nothing had changed in Russia. People continued to move about without a mask, and people certainly were not locked down. Life was normal.</p>
<p>Amid the normalcy, I suddenly received a shocking email: my study abroad had been canceled by my university in the United States. They told me that I needed to return home immediately and to “self-isolate” for 14 days after my return. The contrast between the vibrant streets of Saint Petersburg and that email captured the core of the pandemic; the response to COVID-19 was completely subjective, and these subjective preferences were imposed on the general population, depriving people of liberty, autonomy, and freedom of choice.</p>

		<p>Researchers found that most of the apps available on Apple’s App Store leak at least one hard-coded secret.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at 156,000 iOS apps and discovered more than 815,000 hardcoded secrets, including very sensitive secrets like keys to cloud storage, various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and even payment processors.</p>
<p>The researchers noted how:</p>
<p>“The average app’s code exposes 5.2 secrets, and 71% of apps leak at least one secret.”</p>

		<p>During an Advanced Continual Threat Hunt (ACTH) investigation in early February 2025, Trustwave SpiderLabs discovered a resurgence of fake CAPTCHA verifications designed to deceive victims into executing malicious PowerShell scripts. This campaign employs a multi-stage PowerShell execution process, ultimately delivering infostealers such as Lumma and Vidar.</p>
