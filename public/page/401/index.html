		<p>Enterprises are increasingly turning to Kubernetes for container orchestration, drawn by its promise of scalability, agility, and portability. While cloud-based Kubernetes solutions have gained traction, on-premises deployments remain a compelling option for organizations seeking greater control, security, and cost-efficiency. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2). Plus, we will configure MetalLB as a load balancer and integrate Rook-Ceph as a storage orchestrator for persistent storage.</p>

		<p>If you speak to teams or organizations running Kubernetes in production, one of the complaints youâ€™ll often hear is how difficult multi-tenancy is. Organizations follow two approaches to share Kubernetes clusters with multiple tenants (multiple teams or people).</p>
<p>Those two approaches are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Namespace-based multi-tenancy</li>
<li>Cluster-based multi-tenancy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Namespace-based multi-tenancy:</strong></p>
<p>In namespace-based multi-tenancy, each team or tenant is restricted to a single namespace or a specific set of namespaces. The administrator is responsible for restricting access through RBAC. Once the team/tenant gains permissions they will be deploying their applications (pods) to these sets of namespaces. Though it appears simple and flawless, here are some of the drawbacks of this approach:</p>

		<p>DigitalOcean Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private networking solution that provides isolation for resources running on the DigitalOcean public cloud on isolated private networks. As of this writing, Droplets, DigitalOceanâ€™s virtual machines, and Managed Databases products can run natively on VPC.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-digitalocean-vpc">What is DigitalOcean VPC?</h2>
<p>Over time there has been a growing need for secure networks, driven by the increase in digital footprints of online businesses, and greater needs for cloud mobility and ever increasing data breaches over networks. VPC provides a more secure, isolated, private IP network within the DigitalOcean cloud. Private networking of this form provides a strong security foundation with increased protection and privacy of data as it moves around within the DigitalOcean ecosystem isolated from the public internet.</p>

		<p>Have you ever used AI tools like ChatGPT to chat with a robot or Stable Diffusion to generate unique images? Wondered how they work?</p>
<p>Familiar apps, like the contacts app you use, use structured data, i.e., name, phone number, email address, and a few more text and numeric fields. While AI apps deal with different kinds of data that are unstructured. Some examples of unstructured data are articles, chats, pictures, multimedia, etc. These are quite complex for computer programs to process and understand the context.</p>

		<p>In recent years, weâ€™ve witnessed two recurring trends: the release of increasingly powerful GPUs and the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions or trillions of parameters and expansive context windows. Many businesses are leveraging these LLMs by fine-tuning them or building out apps with domain-specific knowledge using RAG and deploying them on dedicated GPU servers. Now, when it comes to deploying these models on GPU, one thing to notice is the model size, i.e., the space required (for storing the parameters and context tokens) to load the model into the GPU memory is too high compared to the memory available on the GPU.</p>

		<p>We are fast approaching the end of (another) turbulent year for cybersecurity. Looking back, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that so much can happen in such a short time. As we finish up our work for the year, head home to our families, and prepare to close the book on 2024, it&rsquo;s worth considering what&rsquo;s next. And who better than Fortra&rsquo;s experts to offer insights into the year to come? Keep reading for expert predictions of cybersecurity in 2025.

<p>Itâ€™s been a big year for big data breaches. Billions of records on millions of people have been exposed at an estimated cost of nearly $10 trillion dollars to people and businesses alike worldwide.[i]</p>
<p>While we still have a few weeks in the year left to go, hereâ€™s a roundup of five of the most noteworthy breaches this year. And while you canâ€™t prevent big data breaches from happening, you can still take several preventive steps to protect yourself from the fallout. Weâ€™ll cover them here too.</p>

</p>
<p>In this research, we uncovered several vulnerabilities and security flaws within the Prometheus ecosystem. These findings span across three major areas: information disclosure, denial-of-service (DoS), and code execution. Â We found that exposed Prometheus servers or exporters, often lacking proper authentication, allowed attackers to easily gather sensitive information, such as credentials and API keys.Â Â Â </p>

<p>Despite initial interest in the 1990s and early 2000s, palmtop computers never really took off. Realistically most consumers were probably satisfied enough with smartphones as they became more widely available, but those of us who would prefer a real keyboard on our mobile devices are still feeling the pain. Today there are still a few commercial palmtop-like machines out there, but they arenâ€™t exactly mainstream.</p>
<p>Which is why this 3D printed case for the Pixel 6 Pro from [TypingCat] is so interesting. It takes a relatively popular and capable contemporary phone, pairs it with a physical keyboard, and manages to create something that looks quite practical. Thanks to Termux, you can even get a fairly usable Linux environment going on the thing.</p>
