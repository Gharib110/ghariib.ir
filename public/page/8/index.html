	<div>
		<p>2025 marks the year in which officials start to understand the importance of encryption! Following the example of America’s Cyberdefence Agency (CISA), the Swedish Armed Forces have issued a new directive requiring the use of the Signal app for calls and messages whenever possible. The decision underscores the increasing need for end-to-end encryption in the face of growing cyber threats and state-level surveillance.</p>

		<p>Imagine building an LLM-powered assistant trained on your developer documentation and some internal guides to quickly help customers, reduce support workload, and improve user experience. Sounds great, right? But what if sensitive data, such as employee details or internal discussions, is included in the data used to train the LLM? Attackers could manipulate the assistant into exposing sensitive data or exploit it for social engineering attacks, where they deceive individuals or systems into revealing confidential details, or use it for targeted phishing attacks. Suddenly, your helpful AI tool turns into a serious security liability. </p>

	<div>
		<p>With financial stress at an all-time high, and many Americans grappling with confusion about social security, Medicaid, and Medicare, people are desperately seeking relief. Scammers know this all too well and have tailored their tactics to exploit these fears, preying on vulnerable individuals with promises of “free money.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s a so-called “subsidy program,” a “government grant,” or a “relief card,” these scams all share the same underlying goal—to manipulate people into giving away their personal information, or—worse—their hard-earned cash. </p>

		<p>As companies rapidly adopt AI technologies, CISOs face a new frontier of security challenges. Many security leaders find themselves grappling with unfamiliar questions: How do we evaluate AI vendors differently from traditional software vendors? What security controls matter most? Where does vendor responsibility end and customer responsibility begin? How do we evaluate AI security risks within the context of the service provided? To help answer these questions, we’ve created the GitLab AI Security Framework to show security leaders how GitLab and customers enable secure AI-powered development using GitLab Duo.</p>

<p>For an internal event atCryptomathic, we invited some our clients from the financial and trust service sectors to share their insight on future trends around our solutions. We had expected topics such as post quantum cryptography, the use of confidential computing to secure the transition to cloud, targeted threats from groups that want to destabilise high street banks and the economy to be the number one concern.</p>

<p>The financial sector serves as the backbone of the global economy, making it one of the most targeted industries for cyber attacks. As online banking, mobile transactions, and fintech innovations expand, cyber threats continue to evolve. Cyber criminals continuously exploit vulnerabilities in financial applications, making strong security measures essential for protecting sensitive customer data, transactions, and business operations. To mitigate these risks, efficient web application firewalls (WAFs) have become a crucial security mechanism for financial services. In recent GigaOm Radar for Application and API Security report, GigaOm emphasizes the critical role of integrated security measures in today’s digital landscape. The […]</p>

A critical deployment pipeline has failed, and your team is scrambling to figure out why. After hours of digging, you realize someone revoked a personal access token belonging to an engineer who left the company a week ago. This token was tied to several key automation processes, and now your entire system is in chaos. How do you make sure it does not happen again?</p>

The default wallpaper for Ubuntu 25.04 ‘Plucky Puffin’ has been unveiled. Each new Ubuntu release bears a bespoke desktop background and animal mascot, and the upcoming release of the Plucky Puffin proves no exception. Ubuntu 25.04’s default wallpaper makes heavy use of the nautical motifs proffered by its codename animal (a puffin). Avian art is, as per, placed atop a purple gradient background1 with trademark polygonal edge detailing: The “colour” version above is the stock default, but there are 4 variants in total: colour, light, dimmed, and dark (used in dark mode). Users can set any of those as their […]</p>
