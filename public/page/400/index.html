		<p>Memory unsafe languages are those that do not handle any memory management on behalf of the developer. For example, when programming in C or C++, if you need memory during runtime, you will need to allocate and deallocate the memory yourself, running the risk of ending up with memory leaks in cases when you inadvertently forget to deallocate it. Other languages like Ada and FORTRAN provide some memory management but may not prevent memory leaks. Many organizations, including those in the public sector, have applications that have been developed using languages that are memory unsafe and are often looking to modernize these to a memory safe language, such as Java, Python, JavaScript, or Golang.</p>

		<p>In the early days of computing, applications handled tasks sequentially. As the scale grew with millions of users, this approach became impractical. Asynchronous processing allowed handling multiple tasks concurrently, but managing threads/processes on a single machine led to resource constraints and complexity.</p>
<p>This is where distributed parallel processing comes in. By spreading the workload across multiple machines, each dedicated to a portion of the task, it offers a scalable and efficient solution. If you have a function to process a large batch of files, you can divide the workload across multiple machines to process files concurrently instead of handling them sequentially on one machine. Additionally, it improves performance by leveraging combined resources and provides scalability and fault tolerance. As the demands increase, you can add more machines to increase available resources.</p>

		<p><em>This post (originally published in 2019) has been updated to include recent product updates and cost calculations.</em></p>
<p>Many companies are moving to Kubernetes as the platform of choice for running software workloads. When an organization using VMs in AWS earlier decides to move to Kubernetes (Either EKS or self-managed in AWS), one of the questions that come up is whether one should continue to use Amazon CloudWatch or switch to some other tool like Prometheus? Many organizations think managing Prometheus can be challenging and bring more overheads. Recently, AWS launched a managed Prometheus service for such organizations. While CloudWatch vs Prometheus is not an exact apple to apple comparison, there are reasons to explore this and choose tooling that is built for the future. This post will explore various aspects and pros and cons, including costs of all three options.</p>

		<p>In the training phase, a machine learning (ML) model recognizes patterns in the training data and stores these patterns as numerical values called weights (model parameters). These parameters are used to predict an answer when the model is given new input data or a question.</p>
<p>For example, when you ask a question to ChatGPT or any other Large Language Model (LLM), it generates the answer for you. Other ML models are used to detect fraud transactions, image or even audio classification, and so on. These are examples of inference, where the ML model generates or predicts the answer based on the training data. For the inference to run, we need inference servers!</p>

		<p>While everyone is talking about new models and their possible use cases, their deployment aspect often gets overlooked. The journey from a trained model to a production-ready service is a complex and nuanced process that deserves more attention. From the perspective of a web API server, when a developer needs to access information like user profiles or services, we typically create a REST API service that interacts with the database. This API service also handles business logic, enabling the system to process and serve thousands of requests per minute efficiently. However, it is different when we talk about serving models.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s 9 a.m. somewhere, and a DevOps engineer is starting their day. They check their GitLab todo list to see any mentions or tasks assigned to them, collaborating with other stakeholders in their organization. These tasks can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>managing infrastructure</li>
<li>maintaining the configuration of resources</li>
<li>maintaining CI/CD pipelines</li>
<li>automating processes for efficiency</li>
<li>maintaining monitoring and alerting systems</li>
<li>ensuring applications are securely built and deployed</li>
<li>modernizing applications with containerization</li>
</ul>
<p>To carry out these tasks, DevOps engineers spend a lot of time reading documentation, writing configuration files, and searching for help in forums, issues boards, and blogs. Time is spent studying and understanding concepts, and how tools and technologies work. When they don&rsquo;t work as expected, a lot more time is spent investigating why. New tools are released regularly to solve niche or existing problems differently, which introduces more things to learn and maintain context for.</p>

		<p><strong>Streamline your Kubernetes networking with VPC-native DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters</strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce the general availability of VPC-native DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters! This new feature brings seamless integration between your DOKS clusters and VPC resources, enhancing networking flexibility and scalability for your workloads.</p>
<p><strong>What is a VPC-native DOKS cluster?</strong></p>
<p>VPC-native DOKS clusters enable native routing between Kubernetes clusters and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources. This means your DOKS clusters can operate as a natural extension of your existing VPC network architecture, allowing for streamlined connectivity and improved performance.</p>

		<p>Crowdstrike reported a 75% increase in cloud environment intrusions from 2022 to 2023 (source). IBM’s cost of data breach report shows that the global average cost of a data breach in 2024 is USD 4.88M, a 10% increase over last year and the highest total ever. Cyber attacks would scale much faster with the help of artificial intelligence. If organizations are not prepared, the consequences will be dire.</p>
<p>There are many security frameworks that can help organizations enable security and safety for their applications and users. In this blog post, we will discuss NIST CSF, one of the most used security frameworks that helps organizations understand and prevent cybersecurity risks. We will cover the key enhancements in NIST CSF 2.0 briefly, explain the primary components of CSF in detail, and show the best practices for maintaining NIST CSF in the cloud.</p>

		<p>While manual code review processes may suffice for a small team, as DevSecOps teams scale, the processes create significant bottlenecks that impede software development velocity and quality. Often slow, inconsistent, and frequently failing to catch critical vulnerabilities, the manual approach leads to technical debt and increased security risks.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks and drive innovation, organizations must prioritize automated code quality and compliance systems. The financial implications of poor code management are substantial, with technical debt consuming up to 40% of IT budgets (McKinsey Digital: Tech Debt Report) and software vulnerabilities costing an average of $4.88 million per security breach (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report).</p>
