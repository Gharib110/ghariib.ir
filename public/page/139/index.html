<p>My AWS Learning Journey and Ramp-Up Guide for Beginners<br>
Introduction<br>
Hello, fellow developers! I’m Nikhil , an aspiring Cloud Architect, and today I’m excited to share my AWS learning journey with you. Like many of you, I started with little hands-on experience in the cloud, but after diving into AWS, I’ve learned so much, and I want to help others get on the same path. Whether you’re new to cloud computing or just starting your AWS journey, this post will walk you through the steps I took, the challenges I faced, and a guide on how you can ramp up your AWS skills too.</p>
