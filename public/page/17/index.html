		<p><em><strong>CTO Wanted: Build the Future of Proof of compute Decentralized Cloud Computing!</strong></em></p>
<p>Who We Are</p>
<p>We are a startup on a mission to disrupt Cryto, AWS &amp; Google Cloud with a decentralized, open-source cloud platform powered by Proof of Compute (PoC) instead of Proof of Work. Our vision? Turn idle computing power into a decentralized cloud where miners earn by contributing real compute resources.</p>
<p>What We‚Äôre Building</p>
<p>üîπ A global, distributed cloud that is cheaper, faster, and censorship-resistant</p>

		<p>Researching and reverse engineering Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE or loosely ‚Äúcharger‚Äù) efforts might require the equipment to be placed beyond the idle state. The idle state is straightforward and usually involves nothing more than powering up the charger. Indeed, this is a very useful state for research where the user interface is in operation, communications both wired and wireless are working and the mobile device app can interact. However, there are times when there is a need to force the charger into other states so that it behaves as though the electric vehicle is attached, the EV is asking for charge, or the EV is charging and the EVSE is providing charging current. ¬†</p>

	<div>
		<p>Washington, D.C.‚Äôs empty federal office buildings rank high among the most¬†visible¬†examples¬†of wasteful government spending. Where else can you find blocks of high-dollar real estate going virtually unused by the very bureaucrats for whom these buildings are supposed to be the nerve centers for their supposed vital functions?</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, you can find similar examples of federal government waste all across the country. Bureaucrats don‚Äôt just pay millions to not use their own buildings. They also pay millions in service contracts to outside organizations for facilities they don‚Äôt use either.</p>

		<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept; it is rapidly becoming a fundamental aspect of our workforce. By 2025, it is anticipated that 50% of jobs will involve AI in some capacity. This shift is not merely a trend; it represents a seismic change in how we work, necessitating urgent adaptation from both employees and employers. Understanding the implications of AI in the workplace is crucial for anyone looking to thrive in this evolving landscape.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As Craig Eyermann notes, the scale of pandemic relief fraud is growing, with $400 billion processed by the Department of Labor and $200 billion through the federal Small Business Administration. As those hunting down waste and fraud should know, pandemic payouts are still going on in California.¬†</p>
<p>In March 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order that effectively locked down the Golden State. When he lifted the state of emergency in February 2023, Gov. Newsom kept a key program in place. Consider some of the projects the California COVID Workplace Outreach Project continues to fund.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The Trump administration‚Äôs tariffs are a disaster for both the Canadian and U.S. economies. As of writing this, the administration has flipped-flopped on implementing them. However, the outcome is nearly as detrimental as imposing tariffs due to the uncertainty that has emerged in our long-standing alliance with America‚Äôs neighbor. Canadian businesses have pulled American products off their shelves en masse and American businesses are unable to plan for the long term if they don‚Äôt know which inputs they‚Äôre able to buy abroad.¬†</p>
