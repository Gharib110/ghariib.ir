		<p>Google just announced the Pixel 9a, and it might have just outshined the iPhone 16e.</p>
<p>While it hasn&rsquo;t been too long since 2025 started, it&rsquo;s clearly been a good (yet competitive) year for affordable smartphones. Exactly one month after the launch of Apple&rsquo;s budget-friendly phone, the iPhone 16e, Google has finally launched the Pixel 9a. At first glance, the Pixel 9a definitely looks promising, and might as well just win this round, fair and square.</p>

		<p>From smartphones to smart homes and even industrial applications, embedded systems are everywhere. But as these systems become more prevalent in our daily lives, the risks of cyber threats grow just as fast. That’s why it’s essential to build security into these embedded systems by design. And just as important as security itself is how […]</p>

</p>
<p>Whether you’re tapping to pay at a coffee shop, or sending money to a friend, or even providing identification, mobile wallets have become the go-to for fast and convenient transactions. In addition to the Google and IOS Wallets on our phones, many loyalty applications, cryptocurrency trading applications, credit card companies and governments agencies, are creating their own wallets to provide identity verifications. As with anything digital, security is paramount. Cybercriminals are always on the lookout for ways to exploit weaknesses, and while on-device hardware security provides a strong foundation, it isn’t cybercriminal proof. </p>

		<p>A common question during a forensic investigation of a digital device is: &ldquo;<strong>Has the user ever used the XYZ application?</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As always when answering this question, it is important to create and follow a solid process.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to share a possible process that everyone should customize based on their needs and roles.</p>
<p>The ability to answer the question depends on the acquisition that was obtained from the device. In this blog post, I will address the scenario where you have a full file system acquisition (or physical, for older devices).</p>

		<p><em>This week on the Lock and Code podcast…</em></p>
<p>Something’s not right in the world of location data.</p>
<p>In January, a location data broker named Gravy Analytics was hacked, with the alleged cybercriminal behind the attack posting an enormous amount of data online as proof. Though relatively unknown to most of the public, Gravy Analytics is big in the world of location data collection, and, according to an enforcement action from the US Federal Trade Commission last year, the company claimed to “collect, process, and curate more than 17 billion signals from around a billion mobile devices daily.”</p>
