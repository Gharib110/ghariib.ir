Canonical and Intel have announced they’re making it easier for Ubuntu users to get cutting-edge drivers for Intel’s newest discrete GPUs. The effort brings “ray tracing and improved machine learning performance” for Intel Arc B580 and B570 “Battlemage” discrete GPUs to users on Ubuntu 24.10, building on that releases’ preexisting support for Intel Core Ultra Xe2 iGPUs. “For the past decade, Ubuntu has been one of the first distributions to enable the latest Intel architectures. Building upon this strong collaboration, Intel and Canonical are excited to announce the availability of an Ubuntu graphics preview for [24.10]”, they say. Users with […]</p>

		<p>UFONet is an open redirect DDoS tool designed to launch attacks against a target, using insecure redirects in third party web applications, like a botnet. Obviously, only for testing purposes. The tool abuses OSI Layer 7-HTTP to create/manage ‘zombies’ and to conduct different attacks using; GET/POST, multi-threading, proxies, origin spoofing methods, cache evasion techniques, etc. […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Cloudflare Stream launched AI-powered automated captions to transcribe English in on-demand videos in March 2024. Customers&rsquo; immediate next questions were about other languages — both <em>transcribing</em> audio from other languages, and <em>translating</em> captions to make subtitles for other languages. As the Stream Product Manager, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about how we might tackle these, but I wondered…</p>
<p><strong>What if I just translated a generated</strong> <strong>VTT</strong> <strong>(caption file)? Can we do that?</strong> I hoped to use Workers AI to conduct a quick experiment to learn more about the problem space, challenges we may find, and what platform capabilities we can leverage.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Cybersecurity is a fast-growing field, with a constant need for skilled professionals. But unlike other professions — like medicine or aviation — there’s no clear-cut pathway to qualifying for cybersecurity positions. For employers and job seekers alike, this can make the journey to building a team (or entering a successful cybersecurity career) feel uncertain. Enter the registered apprenticeship program — a proven method for developing skilled talent in cybersecurity that benefits both the employer and the new professional. Let’s commit to supporting this important talent development approach</p>

	<div>
		<p>Today, managing vendor relationships has never been more critical. With increasing reliance on third-party vendors, organizations face heightened risks that can affect their operations and reputation. Vendor risk management (VRM) ensures that companies can identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with their vendor partnerships, particularly as new challenges emerge. Traditional VRM methods often struggle to keep pace with the complexities of modern supply chains, which is where the application of artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play.</p>

	<div>
		<p>For many years, software virtualization has allowed retailers to deliver improved store-based applications without the need to add hardware capacity. Customer-facing applications such as stock control and customer loyalty programs, and colleague-facing applications such as replenishment and staff rotas are critical to store success. As the number and complexity of store applications increases, retailers will frequently use hardware and software virtualization techniques to support the increased demands for capacity while avoiding the cost of supplying additional hardware. As retailers increas</p>

		<p>Hackers are exploiting two VMware vCenter Server flaws, one of which is a critical remote code execution flaw. Both vulnerabilities received security updates in September 2024, but the initial patches didn’t solve the problems completely. Thus, in October, VMware released a new patch to close the RCE vulnerability. Now security researchers warn users that they’ve […]</p>

Broadcom has released updates for VMware Workstation Pro for Windows and Linux, the first to arrive since the software became entirely free to use. Earlier this year, Broadcom made VMware Workstation Pro and its Mac equivalent Fusion Pro free for personal usage, and later for commercial usage. Anyone can download and install VMware’s desktop virtualisation software to use for whatever they want. — Assuming they have the patience to wade through rerouting links, portals, checkboxes, and dense documentation sites to locate the actual download. A blog post from a VMware team member walks through the 11 step (!) process. As […]</p>
