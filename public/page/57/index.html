		<p>Explore key outcomes of the 2023 CRI Summit, the latest global strategies, and AI&rsquo;s role in combating ransomware threats.</p>
<p>The post The 2023 Counter Ransomware Initiative Summit | Stepping Up Global Collaboration in Cybersecurity appeared first on SentinelOne DE.</p>
<p>Ransomware’s transformation from a targeted cybercrime to a significant threat to national security has increasingly drawn attention at international forums like the Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) Summit. The 2023 Summit, which brought together representatives from 50 countries, signifies a growing, yet cautious, acknowledgment of the need for collaborative strategies in tackling this complex issue.</p>

</p>
<p>Social media connects us to friends, trends, and news in real time—but it also opens the door to scammers looking to exploit trust and curiosity. From fake giveaways to impersonation scams, fraudsters use sophisticated tactics to trick users into handing over personal information, money, or access to their accounts. </p>
<p>Even the most internet-savvy users can fall victim to these deceptive schemes. That’s why it’s crucial to <strong>recognize the red flags before it’s too late</strong>. Whether it’s a DM from a “friend” in trouble, a deal that seems too good to be true, or a sudden request to verify your account, scammers prey on urgency and emotion to pull you in. </p>

	<div>
		<p>Cloud security remains an evolving challenge as new attack vectors emerge, often leveraging misconfigurations rather than outright software vulnerabilities. In August 2024, researchers at <strong>Datadog Security Labs</strong> uncovered a novel <strong>name confusion attack</strong> that exploits a misconfiguration in the way <strong>Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</strong> are retrieved within AWS environments. This attack, dubbed <strong>whoAMI</strong>, enables adversaries to execute arbitrary code within AWS accounts by manipulating AMI selection mechanisms.</p>
<p>This report provides an in-depth analysis of the <strong>whoAMI attack</strong>, its underlying mechanisms, real-world impact, mitigation strategies, and best practices for cloud security professionals.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The Go programming language has reached another significant milestone with the release of version 1.24. We at Red Hat are particularly excited about one of its standout features, native FIPS 140-3 support. This addition represents a major step forward for Go&rsquo;s adoption in enterprise and government environments where security compliance is paramount.</p>
<h2 id="native-fips-support">Native FIPS support</h2>
<p>The introduction of the FIPS Cryptographic Module in Go 1.24 marks a watershed moment for the language&rsquo;s security capabilities. This new module provides FIPS 140-3-compliant implementations of cryptographic algorithms, seamlessly integrated into the standard library. What makes this particularly noteworthy is its transparent implementation. Existing Go applications can leverage FIPS-compliant cryptography without requiring code changes.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The ability to effectively visualize and manage data flows is crucial for organizational success. As businesses generate vast amounts of data, understanding how this information moves between sources and targets becomes essential for making informed decisions. Without a clear data flow mapping strategy, companies risk mismanaging their data assets.</p>

</p>
<p>Data flow mapping involves defining data sources and targets, identifying data requirements, and employing various mapping techniques to ensure seamless data movement. From manual efforts to sophisticated automated solutions, organizations must choose the best approach that caters to their specific needs, all while addressing challenges such as data complexity and integration with legacy systems.</p>

		<p>Kubernetes 1.31 completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems.</p>
