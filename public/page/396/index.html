		<p>The first part of our three-part series on test generation with GitLab Duo focused on how to automate code testing. Now, we will share the lessons we learned while using AI for test generation.</p>
<h2 id="situations-we-encountered-and-how-we-handled-them">Situations we encountered and how we handled them</h2>
<p>Overall, we were pleased with the results using GitLab Duo to generate tests on our code. As is the case with any language generation, some cases required minor adjustments such as fixing import paths or editing contents in datasets. For the more complex cases, we had to remember that AI solutions often lack context. Here&rsquo;s how we handled the more complex testing situations with GitLab Duo.</p>

		<p>In previous entries in this series, we covered how we used GitLab Duo to generate tests for our code as well as what we learned while using GitLab Duo for generating automated tests. We also shared some of the ways we addressed making changes to GitLab Duo generated tests. This last article in the series will cover a test we ran to validate the impact of GitLab Duo on our team’s automated testing and discuss the impressive results we have achieved thus far.</p>

<p>Today, our most sensitive information is generally encrypted — from your personal messages, banking and health information to things like classified military documents and companies&rsquo; trade secrets.</p>
<p>But there’s a growing threat looming over our collective privacy and security — and that’s quantum computing. Currently being developed by the largest tech companies, startups and governments alike, quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations faster than today’s computers.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-56332<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 9 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to versions 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2, Next.js is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution. This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version. There are no official workarounds.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 5.3 | MEDIUM<br>
