		<p>We&rsquo;re making a change to the IP address for <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">www.virustotal.com</a>. If you&rsquo;re currently whitelisting our IP address in your firewall or proxy, you&rsquo;ll need to update your rules to maintain access to VirusTotal.</p>
<p>Starting November 25th, we&rsquo;ll be gradually transitioning the resolution of <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">www.virustotal.com</a> to a new IP address: <strong>34.54.88.138</strong>. If you have hardcoded the previous IP address (74.125.34.46) in your firewall or proxy, you&rsquo;ll need to update your configuration to include the new IP address. This will ensure continued access to VirusTotal.</p>

		<p>Throughout 2024, Bitdefender Labs has been closely monitoring a series of malvertising campaigns that exploit popular platforms to spread malware. These campaigns use fake advertisements to lure users into installing malicious software disguised as legitimate apps or updates.</p>
<p>One of the more recent campaigns Bitdefender Labs uncovered involves a fake Bitwarden extension advertised on Meta’s social media platform Facebook. The campaign tricks users into installing a harmful browser extension und</p>

<p>Apparently, before a child reaches the age of 13, advertisers will have gathered more 72 <em>million</em> data points on them. I knew I&rsquo;d seen a metric about this sometime recently, so I went looking for &ldquo;7,000&rdquo;, which perfectly illustrates how unaware we are of the extent of data collection on all of us. I started Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) in the first place because I was surprised at where my data had turned up in breaches. 11 years and 14 billion breached records later, I&rsquo;m <em>still</em> surprised!</p>

<p>I’m frequently amused by the sort of stuff my Facebook friends “like”. For example:</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>The more salacious content you find around Facebook often has a hidden agenda, for example the classic She did WHAT in school scam I wrote about last year. Snapchat allows you to take a pic or a video and set an expiry date after which it’s “theoretically” destroyed, just the sort of stuff that appeals to sexting teens. By extension, “leaked” Snapchats are just the sort of stuff that appeal to a whole different audience.</p>

	<div>
		<p>SMS services remain a critical part of telecommunications; they don&rsquo;t require Internet access, and companies use them to inform their customers. This combination of features makes them incredibly useful for criminals who use the technology as a stepping stone in their never-ending campaigns. And if you think that the new RCS messaging standard will offer any protection, you would be wrong. These types of scams will continue to spread regardless of the messaging standard used.</p>

<p>I want to try something new here - bear with me here:</p>
<p>Data breach processing is <em>hard</em> and the hardest part of all is getting in touch with organisations and disclosing the incident before I load anything into Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). It&rsquo;s also something I do almost entirely in isolation, sitting here on my own trying to put the pieces together to work out what happened. I don&rsquo;t want to just chuck data into HIBP and the first an organisation knows about it is angry customers smashing out their inbox, there&rsquo;s got to be a reasonable attempt from my side to get in touch, disclose and then coordinate on communication to impacted parties and the public at large. Very frequently, I end up reaching out publicly and asking for a security contact at the impacted company. I dislike doing this because it&rsquo;s a very public broadcast that regular followers easily read between the lines of and draw precisely the correct conclusion before the organisation has had a chance to respond. And the vast majority of the time, nobody has a contact anyway but a small handful of people trawl through the site and find obscure email addresses or look up employees on LinkedIn or similar. There has to be a better way.</p>

<p>The EUDI (European Digital Identity) wallet solution reference architecture (ARF) is designed to provide a secure framework for managing digital identities across various services. However, it is essential to identify and address potential vulnerabilities within the ARF. Failure to do so will compromise the security, privacy and integrity of the system. </p>

In this post, we will play the role of a CTI analyst working for a Singaporean financial institution.</p>
<p>As a first step, we search for threat actors that traditionally both targeted the <strong>financial industry</strong> and <strong>Singaporean companies</strong>.</p>
