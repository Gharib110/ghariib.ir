		<p>Infostealer capabilities and how to protect your organization against this threat.</p>
<p>Although malicious programs that hunt for passwords, financial, and other sensitive data have been around for over 20 years, the word “infostealer” was coined only in the early 2010s. Recently, however, this relatively simple type of malware has been popping up in unexpected role — deployed as a springboard for major targeted hacks and cyberattacks. For example, the theft of the data of 500 million Ticketmaster customers and a ransomware attack on the Brazilian Ministry of Health were both traced to infostealers. The main challenge posed by infostealers is that they can’t be defeated solely at the infrastructure level and within a company’s perimeter. The non-work activities and personal devices of employees also need to be considered.</p>

<p>Winter travel is filled with excitement—whether you’re heading to a snow-covered ski resort, visiting family for the holidays, or enjoying a cozy retreat in a picturesque town. According to Tripadvisor’s Winter Travel Index, 57% of Americans are gearing up for winter travel this year, with a staggering 96% planning to travel as much or more than they did last winter. Yet, with this seasonal joy comes a hidden danger: public Wi-Fi. Airports, hotels, coffee shops, and even ski lodges offer free Wi-Fi, making it easy to stay connected while on the go. But while these networks are convenient, they can also be risky.</p>

<p>Whether it tags along via a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or wearable, it seems like the internet follows us wherever we go nowadays. Yet there’s something else that follows us around as well — a growing body of personal info that we create while banking, shopping, and simply browsing the internet. And no doubt about it, our info is terrifically valuable.</p>
<p>What makes it so valuable? It’s no exaggeration to say that your personal info is the key to your digital life, along with your financial and civic life as well. Aside from using it to create accounts and logins, it’s further tied to everything from your bank accounts and credit cards to your driver’s license and your tax refund.</p>
