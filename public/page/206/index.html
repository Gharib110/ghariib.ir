<p>Healthcare entities have a 51% probability of falling victim to phishing attacks. Successful incidents not only lead to control over systems, but can also expose patient health information, financial and insurance data. Healthcare providers are seeing an 81% uptick in threats, especially as cyber criminals weaponize increasingly advanced methods, and some organizations are struggling to keep pace. With over 265 clinic locations across the United States and a mission to deliver high-quality, accessible and compassionate care to under-served communities, Fast Pace Health recently found itself ill-equipped to fend off high volumes of relentless cyber threats. On account of overseeing large […]</p>

<p>“If you’re working with an organism like squid that can edit genetic information way better than any other organism, then it makes sense that that might be useful for a therapeutic application like deadening pain,” he said.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Researchers hope to mimic how squid and octopus use RNA editing in nerve channels that interpret pain and use that knowledge to manipulate human cells.</p>

<p>[Surya Chilukuri] writes in to share JTAGprobe — a fork of the official Raspberry Pi debugprobe firmware that lets you use the low-cost microcontroller development board for JTAG and SWD debugging just by flashing the provided firmware image.</p>
<p>We’ve seen similar projects in the past, but they’ve required some additional code running on the computer to bridge the gap between the Pico and your debugging software of choice. But [Surya] says this project works out of the box with common tools such as OpenOCD and pyOCD.</p>

<p>Kodi, the popular free open-source home theater software, released new 21.2 version today with many improvements and tons of bug-fixes.</p>
<p>First, the new Kodi 21.2 features <strong>significant speed increase of library scans</strong> (back to v20 level) as well as faster artwork caching.</p>

<p>For Linux users, the new release enabled/fixed HDR to SDR tone mapping on video sources with partial or missing display metadata, fixed HDR passthrough for HDR videos that didn’t switch TV into HDR mode, and fixed issue that windowed Kodi doubled in size on every start when using Wayland with a scaling factor &gt; 100%.</p>

		<p>The productivity suite is now out of Office.</p>
<p>Back in December, Microsoft gave out a small warning. It stated that it planned to rebrand its entire productivity line from &ldquo;Microsoft 365 Office&rdquo; to &ldquo;Microsoft 365 Copilot,&rdquo; and people didn&rsquo;t really gel with the idea. Well, seems Microsoft didn&rsquo;t really care, as it has given the green light to begin rebranding everyone&rsquo;s apps to a more Copilot-focused brand.</p>

		<p>I am always interested in new phishing tricks, and watching them spread across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>A few days ago I started getting phishing SMS messages with a new twist. They were standard messages about delayed packages or somesuch, with the goal of getting me to click on a link and entering some personal information into a website. But because they came from unknown phone numbers, the links did not work. So—this is the new bit—the messages said something like: “Please reply Y, then exit the text message, reopen the text message activation link, or copy the link to Safari browser to open it.”&hellip;</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become an enterprise’s go-to platform for orchestrating and managing container workloads for cloud-native software. As more organizations adopt it and cloud-native software scales and becomes more complex, the need for container security is high. Kubernetes and container workloads have become a prime enterprise attack surface—67% of organizations delayed or slowed down deployment due to Kubernetes security concerns. There are numerous choices for container security. What sets Check Point CloudGuard apart? Its unique two-axes defense-in-depth approach scans, protects, and detects across an enterprise’s entire container environment. Think of it like this: one axis spans the software development lifecycle (SDLC), […]</p>

		<p>Intel is the one to watch in the GPU scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an odd time to be an Intel fan. The company continues to struggle with its desktop CPUs but Lunar Lake mobile processors and Arc discrete graphics cards have been largely well received. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Intel&rsquo;s push into the affordable GPU market segment, offering gamers excellent value with Battlemage GPUs for less than $250. The latest addition to the family is the Intel Arc B570, a 1080p and 1440p GPU for $219, seriously undercutting some of the offerings from direct competitors. It&rsquo;s a great time to be a PC gamer as Intel looks to break up the GPU duopoly and here&rsquo;s why these cards will be a sleeper hit for desktop systems.</p>

		<p>Crafting a PC with a unique aesthetic might have become harder, but it&rsquo;s not impossible</p>
<p>Ask a PC builder whether they care about performance or looks, and they&rsquo;ll probably answer &ldquo;both.&rdquo; Building a PC that looks unique, however, is easier said than done. Since everyone usually builds with the same overused components, it&rsquo;s hard to craft a PC that stands out. You either end up creating the same fish tank PC as countless others, or an understated black or white-themed build with no RGB.</p>
