<h2 id="1-executive-summary">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CVSS v4 7.2</strong></li>
<li><strong>ATTENTION</strong>: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity</li>
<li><strong>Vendor</strong>: Siemens</li>
<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: SIMATIC S7-1200 CPUs</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Cross-Site Request Forgery</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-risk-evaluation">2. RISK EVALUATION</h2>
<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to change the CPU mode by tricking a legitimate and authenticated user with sufficient permissions on the target CPU to click on a malicious link.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Simultaneous-Message and Succinct Secure Computation</strong><br>
<em>Elette Boyle, Abhishek Jain, Sacha Servan-Schreiber, Akshayaram Srinivasan</em></p>
<p>We put forth and instantiate a new primitive we call simultaneous-message and succinct (SMS) secure computation. An SMS scheme enables a minimal communication pattern for secure computation in the following scenario: Alice has a large private input X, Bob has a small private input y, and Charlie wants to learn $f(X, y)$ for some public function $f$.</p>

<p>ICS and Building Management Systems (BMS) support several protocols such as <em><strong>Modbus</strong></em>, <em>Bacnet</em>, <em>Fieldbus</em> and so on. Those protocols were designed to provide read/write control over sensors and actuators from a central point. </p>
<p>Driven by our past experience with BMS, we decided to release our own methodology and internal tool used for proactive attack surface analysis within systems supporting the Modbus protocol.</p>
<h3 id="the-modbus-protocol">The Modbus Protocol</h3>
<p>Modbus is a well defined protocol described on modbus.org. It was created in 1979 and has become one of the most used standards for communication between industrial electronic devices in a wide range of buses and network.</p>

		<p>A bombshell report was released in December of 2024 by the House Judiciary Committee, revealing that a massive and constitutionally dubious surveillance operation has been underway by the federal government against countless Americans. Titled, <em>“How the Federal Government Weaponized the Bank Secrecy Act to Spy on Americans,”</em> its key findings demonstrate that the FBI and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have been working together to undermine the 4th Amendment and conduct widespread <em>warrantless surveillance</em> on the financial transactions of innocent U.S. citizens engaging in constitutionally protected behavior.</p>
