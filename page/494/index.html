	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The warning message indicates that the globally installed Angular CLI version in your system is greater than the locally installed one in the project. The problem is that the older version is being used because Angular CLI looks for the local version first when executing commands on a project. This version mismatch may cause incompatibility issues and errors such as the one you’re experiencing.</p>
<p>This tutorial will help you to resolve “Your global Angular CLI version is greater than your local version” issue in your Angular application.</p>
