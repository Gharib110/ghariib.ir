		<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, securing software systems has never been more critical. Cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, leading to widespread damage and disruption. That said, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) helped shape best practices for the technology industry with their Secure-by-Design pledge. Cloudflare signed this pledge on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle.</p>

<p>New year, new menaces for cyber defenders. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a novel variant of the notorious Banshee Stealer, which is increasingly targeting Apple users worldwide. This stealthy infostealer malware employs advanced evasion techniques, successfully slipping past detection by leveraging string encryption from Apple’s XProtect antivirus engine. Going exclusively after macOS users, Banshee is capable of stealing browser credentials, login data, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information from the files.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Doubly Efficient Fuzzy Private Set Intersection for High-dimensional Data with Cosine Similarity</strong><br>
<em>Hyunjung Son, Seunghun Paik, Yunki Kim, Sunpill Kim, Heewon Chung, Jae Hong Seo</em></p>
<p>Fuzzy private set intersection (Fuzzy PSI) is a cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving similarity matching, which is one of the essential operations in various real-world applications such as facial authentication, information retrieval, or recommendation systems. Despite recent advancements in fuzzy PSI protocols, still a huge barrier remains in deploying them for these applications. The main obstacle is the high dimensionality, e.g., from 128 to 512, of data; lots of existing methods, Garimella et al. (CRYPTO’23, CRYPTO’24) or van Baarsen et al. (EUROCRYPT’24), suffer from exponential overhead on communication and/or computation cost. In addition, the dominant similarity metric in these applications is cosine similarity, which disables several optimization tricks based on assumptions for the distribution of data, e.g., techniques by Gao et al. (ASIACRYPT’24). In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy PSI protocol for cosine similarity, called FPHE, that overcomes these limitations at the same time. FPHE features linear complexity on both computation and communication with respect to the dimension of set elements, only requiring much weaker assumption than prior works. The basic strategy of ours is to homomorphically compute cosine similarity and run an approximated comparison function, with a clever packing method for efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel proof technique to harmonize the approximation error from the sign function with the noise flooding, proving the security of FPHE under the semi-honest model. Moreover, we show that our construction can be extended to support various functionalities, such as labeled or circuit fuzzy PSI. Through experiments, we show that FPHE can perform fuzzy PSI over 512-dimensional data in a few minutes, which was computationally infeasible for all previous proposals under the same assumption as ours.</p>

<p>Whilst 2024 saw the adoption of <strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> accelerate, it also witnessed significant debates and challenges surrounding its use within business from security and data privacy perspectives, with questions surrounding its true value.</p>
<p>As CIOs prepare to tackle AI in 2025, Richard Farrell, CIO of Netcall, shares the top trends that must be prioritised in the year ahead to ensure successful adoption.</p>

Enlightenment 0.27, released this week, brings a wealth of incremental improvements to users of this unique desktop environment. Though not as well known or widely used as GNOME, Xfce, KDE Plasma, et al, Enlightenment (often abbreviated as just ‘E’) differentiates itself through the use of Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). An assembly of modules, Enlightenment offers a lightweight window manager, compositor, and desktop shell built using Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), plus a small set of native EFL-based apps including a file manager, photo viewer, and terminal. Enlightenment’s aesthetics aren’t to everyone’s tastes (it’d be a boring world if it did; most […]</p>

<p>Enlightenment, the extremely lightweight window manager and minimal desktop, released new 0.27.0 few days ago.</p>
<p>According to the official release note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is the latest release of Enlightenment. This has a lot of fixes mostly with some new features.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing else!</p>
<p>But if you’re interested in this new e27 release, here are the changes that I summarized by digging through the source page.</p>

<p>First, e27 <strong>reduced CPU usage when gaming with proto/steam</strong>. These games change their props all the time, causing e to keep looking things up. The developer updated the code to workaround that can drop CPU usage drastically by about 60-70% or more.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR — Email addresses in stealer logs can now be queried in HIBP to discover which websites they&rsquo;ve had credentials exposed against.

<p>Using a firewall is essential to secure the installation of the extraction agent when performing low-level extraction from a variety of iOS devices. We developed two solutions: a software-based firewall for macOS and a hardware-based firewall using a Raspberry Pi (or similar microcomputer) with our own custom firmware. This guide will help you choose the best option for your needs.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let us clarify that the solutions described in this article are neither traditional nor fully-featured firewalls. Instead, they are designed to restrict internet access to specific endpoints during a critical phase of the sideloading process.</p>
