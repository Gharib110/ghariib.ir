	<b><time>16.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hey there, fellow engineers and tech enthusiasts! I’m excited to share one of my favorite strategies for modern software delivery: combining Docker and Jenkins to power up your CI/CD pipelines. </p>
<p>Throughout my career as a Senior DevOps Engineer and Docker Captain, I’ve found that these two tools can drastically streamline releases, reduce environment-related headaches, and give teams the confidence they need to ship faster.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll walk you through what Docker and Jenkins are, why they pair perfectly, and how you can build and maintain efficient pipelines. My goal is to help you feel right at home when automating your workflows. Let’s dive in.</p>

	<b><time>16.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Without continuous improvement in software security, you’re not standing still — you’re walking backward into oncoming traffic. Attack vectors multiply, evolve, and look for the weakest link in your software supply chain daily. </p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures forecasts that the global cost of software supply chain attacks will reach nearly $138 billion by 2031, up from $60 billion in 2025 and $46 billion in 2023. A single overlooked vulnerability isn’t just a flaw; it’s an open invitation for compromise, potentially threatening your entire system. The cost of a breach doesn’t stop with your software — it extends to your reputation and customer trust, which are far harder to rebuild. </p>
