<p>With ready availability of single board computers, displays, keyboards, power packs, and other hardware, a home-made laptop is now a project within most people’s reach. Some laptop projects definitely veer towards being cyberdecks while others take a more conventional path, but we’ve rarely seen one as professional looking as [Byran Huang]’s anyon_e open source laptop. It really takes the art to the next level.</p>
<p>The quality is immediately apparent in the custom CNC-machined anodised aluminium case, and upon opening it up the curious user could be forgiven for thinking they had a stylish commercial machine in their hands. There’s a slimline mechanical keyboard and a glass trackpad, and that display is an OLED. In fact the whole thing had been built from scratch, and inside is an RK3588 SoC on a module sitting on a custom-designed motherboard. It required some effort for it to drive the display, a process we’ve seen cause pain to other designers, but otherwise it runs Debian. The batteries are slimline pouch cells, with a custom controller board driven by an ESP32.</p>

		<p>Keep an eye on your internet performance using this app.</p>
<p>As someone who’s been working remotely for well over a decade, reliable internet connectivity isn’t just essential — it’s non-negotiable. Whether it’s researching for an article, joining a video call, or catching up on YouTube, inconsistent internet performance can seriously hamper productivity — and leisure. Speed drops, intermittent lags, or latency issues aren’t always consistent; they come and go, making it challenging to hold your internet service provider accountable. In fact, a poor ISP can make investing in the best Wi-Fi routers futile. To address this problem, I’ve been using a Docker-based app to track my internet speed and uptime. Here’s how it worked out.</p>

		<p>With Cloudflare conducting media resource caching at the data center closest in proximity to its users, security researcher Daniel discovered that an information-disclosure intrusion could be conducted through the delivery of a unique image hosted on Cloudflare&rsquo;s CDN to a vulnerable app, which would use the Cloudflare Teleport tool to route the requests to certain data centers.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky enough to work from home, you’ll soon find that it presents its own set of challenges, mostly related to work/life balance. It can get so bad that you don’t know what day of the week it is. Really. Ask us how we know.</p>
<p>Rather than miss a meeting (or a day off), prolific hacker [Arnov Sharma] created this day of the week clock. It uses a customized LED driver board with seven sets of three LEDs, each driven by a MOSFET. Each MOSFET is controlled by a DFRobot Mini Beetle ESP32-C3. It runs on a 2200 mAh, 3.7 V lithium-ion battery.</p>

		<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>For years, Jira has been a go-to tool for project management, especially in software development. However, more and more agencies and startups are reconsidering their reliance on Jira. While it’s a powerful platform, many smaller teams find it overwhelming, expensive, and unnecessarily complex for their needs. In this post, we’ll dive into why agencies and startups are moving away from Jira and explore alternatives that better suit their dynamic workflows.</p>

	<b><time>23.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The worlds of user experience (UX) design and open source technology are increasingly converging. At Red Hat, where open source fuels innovation, this synergy is reshaping how designers and developers collaborate to create impactful tools and workflows. For many UX designers, including myself, the idea of stepping into technical realms like using command line interfaces (CLIs), opening an issue on GitHub, or diving into codebases can feel intimidating and out of reach. But the most impactful opportunities lie within these technical spaces. These opportunities to create new tools and workflows empower users and bridge the gap between design and development.</p>
