Both reports emphasize the growing sophistication of cyber threats, the integration of emerging technologies to make cyber threats harder to detect and deter, and the outsized influence of global geopolitical factors influencing cyber security threats.

<p>While tech-savvy people are very concerned about privacy, knowing where to find metadata leaks can be nebulous even for developers. In this blog post, we will explore examples of unexpected user information leakage. We hope that the information shared in this blog will help developers assess and address potential privacy issues with their applications, as well as educate end-users about potential risks to their privacy that can result from information leaks.</p>

From being lighter on the internals to allowing users to fire up a game via a custom launcher quickly, SteamOS has quickly established itself as the better alternative to unoptimized Windows 11 builds running on most handhelds on the market. It&rsquo;s also a big reason why the Steam Deck OLED is the best PC gaming handheld at the moment.</p>
