		<p>Companies are showing customers different prices for the same goods and services based what data they have on them, including details like their precise location or browser history.</p>
<p>The name for this method is surveillance pricing, and the FTC has just released initial findings of a report looking into that practice. In July 2024, the FTC requested information from eight companies offering surveillance pricing products and services that incorporate data about consumersâ€™ characteristics and behavior.</p>

<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: RSSPlus</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Authentication Bypass By Primary Weakness</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-risk-evaluation">2. RISK EVALUATION</h2>
<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely (proximal/adjacent with RF equipment) call diagnostic functions which could impact both the availability and integrity.</p>
<h2 id="3-technical-details">3. TECHNICAL DETAILS</h2>
<h3 id="31-affected-products">3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS</h3>
<p>The following versions of RSSPlus are affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSSPlus 2M: build dates 01/08 through at least 01/23</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="32-vulnerability-overview">3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW</h3>
<h4 id="321-authentication-bypass-by-primary-weakness-cwe-305"><strong>3.2.1</strong> <strong>AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY PRIMARY WEAKNESS CWE-305</strong></h4>
<p>The affected product is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability targeting deterministic RSSPlus SecurityAccess service seeds, which may allow an attacker to remotely (proximal/adjacent with RF equipment or via pivot from J2497 telematics devices) call diagnostic functions intended for workshop or repair scenarios. This can impact system availability, potentially degrading performance or erasing software, however the vehicle remains in a safe vehicle state.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In a troubling development for web publishers, numerous site owners are reporting dramatic drops in their Google AdSense earnings since early January 2025, with some seeing their monthly income plummet from comfortable four-figures to barely enough for a month&rsquo;s worth of instant noodles. This sudden downturn has left many content creators in crisis mode, particularly those relying on this income for student loan payments and basic living expenses.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-problem">The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>The impact appears to be widespread across various niches, but particularly noticeable in the technology and educational content sectors. One CS student&rsquo;s story particularly stands out: after five years of building a programming tutorial site from their freshman year study notes, their monthly AdSense revenue crashed from $1,500 to $218 â€“ just days before their $890 student loan payment was due, on this discussion about google adsense revenue drop in the very beginning of this year.</p>

		<p>The recent temporary shutdown of TikTok in the U.S. and its swift restoration underscored the platformâ€™s immense cultural and economic significance. With over 170 million American users and countless businesses relying on TikTok for engagement, marketing, and revenue, the platform has become a cornerstone of modern digital ecosystems. For developers and businesses, TikTokâ€™s APIs offer a gateway to integrate its powerful functionalities into their applications, enabling enhanced user experiences and data-driven insights.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>React 19 brings a game-changing improvement with the <strong><code>use</code></strong> API, making data fetching and asynchronous operations in your components a breeze! ðŸš€ This new approach lets you write cleaner, more readable code by integrating directly with Suspense, eliminating the need for cumbersome lifecycle methods and extra state management. ðŸ˜Š</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The <strong><em>use</em></strong> API in React 19 simplifies <em>fetching data and working with asynchronous resources directly</em> within a component&rsquo;s render function. This eliminates the need for separate lifecycle methods or complex state management for loading and error states.</p>

		<p>Why buy a handheld when you can build one?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of SBC-related news for XDA, which makes it pretty hard for me to be truly blown away by a project. Fortunately, that only means that the ones that do amaze me are truly something stunning. Such is the case of this DIY OLED handheld, which uses an SBC to create a device you can feasibly build for yourself at home.</p>
