		<p>Hatch is DigitalOcean’s global program for startups, which provides startups with credits and discounts on computing resources so they can build and scale without worrying about costs. In 2024, Hatch significantly revamped the program to better support those building businesses in the artificial intelligence sector, providing AI/ML startups with discounts for GPU Droplets and free access to DigitalOcean’s premium support in addition to credits.</p>
<p>Ex-human, a startup building empathetic generative AI solutions backed by A16Z GAMES’ SPEEDRUN accelerator, chose the Hatch program to help serve their customers with AI models—read on to hear about their experience with Hatch so far.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Organizations are increasingly turning to Kubernetes to orchestrate their containerized applications. However, many enterprises face unique challenges that cloud-based Kubernetes solutions cannot fully address. These challenges include leveraging existing bare metal infrastructure, ensuring data sovereignty, optimizing costs, and maintaining granular control over their environments. By deploying Kubernetes on bare metal, companies can achieve greater infrastructure flexibility, meet compliance requirements, and optimize performance for resource-intensive workloads.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal infrastructure using AWS EKS-Anywhere. But before we start using self-hosted Kubernetes, it’s crucial to understand the key differences between managed and self-hosted solutions and where AWS EKS-Anywhere fits in.</p>

		<p>The GitLab Security Operations team prioritizes automation that enables security engineers to focus on high-impact work rather than routine tasks that can be automated. A key innovation in this automation strategy is creation of the User Attestation Module (UAM), which allows GitLab team members to directly respond to and verify security alerts flagged as potentially malicious. When the GUARD framework detects suspicious activity, it routes the alert to the relevant team member for review. The team member can then attest whether they recognize and authorize the activity. Their response is recorded for audit purposes, and, based on their input, the system either closes the alert or escalates it to the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT).</p>
