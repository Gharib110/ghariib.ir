		<p>Organizations are increasingly turning to Kubernetes to orchestrate their containerized applications. However, many enterprises face unique challenges that cloud-based Kubernetes solutions cannot fully address. These challenges include leveraging existing bare metal infrastructure, ensuring data sovereignty, optimizing costs, and maintaining granular control over their environments. By deploying Kubernetes on bare metal, companies can achieve greater infrastructure flexibility, meet compliance requirements, and optimize performance for resource-intensive workloads.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal infrastructure using AWS EKS-Anywhere. But before we start using self-hosted Kubernetes, it’s crucial to understand the key differences between managed and self-hosted solutions and where AWS EKS-Anywhere fits in.</p>

		<p>Good news for growing businesses and folks with data-intensive applications: we’re excited to introduce 100% larger storage plans for both Managed MySQL and PostgreSQL in select regions. Starting today, Managed MySQL storage has doubled to 20TB, and Managed PostgreSQL now supports up to 30TB, up from 15TB. These expanded storage options are available in Singapore (SGP1), San Francisco (SFO2), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with plans to roll out to more regions later this year.</p>

		<p>The GitLab Security Operations team prioritizes automation that enables security engineers to focus on high-impact work rather than routine tasks that can be automated. A key innovation in this automation strategy is creation of the User Attestation Module (UAM), which allows GitLab team members to directly respond to and verify security alerts flagged as potentially malicious. When the GUARD framework detects suspicious activity, it routes the alert to the relevant team member for review. The team member can then attest whether they recognize and authorize the activity. Their response is recorded for audit purposes, and, based on their input, the system either closes the alert or escalates it to the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT).</p>

	<div>
		<p>2025 marks the year in which officials start to understand the importance of encryption! Following the example of America’s Cyberdefence Agency (CISA), the Swedish Armed Forces have issued a new directive requiring the use of the Signal app for calls and messages whenever possible. The decision underscores the increasing need for end-to-end encryption in the face of growing cyber threats and state-level surveillance.</p>

		<p>Imagine building an LLM-powered assistant trained on your developer documentation and some internal guides to quickly help customers, reduce support workload, and improve user experience. Sounds great, right? But what if sensitive data, such as employee details or internal discussions, is included in the data used to train the LLM? Attackers could manipulate the assistant into exposing sensitive data or exploit it for social engineering attacks, where they deceive individuals or systems into revealing confidential details, or use it for targeted phishing attacks. Suddenly, your helpful AI tool turns into a serious security liability. </p>
