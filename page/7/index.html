<p>With the release of iOS 17.3, Apple introduced a new security feature called “Stolen Device Protection.” This functionality is designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data in cases where a thief has gained knowledge of an iPhone’s passcode. While this feature significantly enhances security for end users, it simultaneously creates substantial obstacles for digital forensic experts, complicating lawful data extraction.</p>
<h2 id="a-roadblock-to-logical-extraction">A Roadblock to Logical Extraction</h2>
<p>Gaining access to data on Apple devices has historically been most feasible through standard mechanisms leveraged by many forensic tools, including iOS Forensic Toolkit, as part of an advanced logical extraction process. Alternative methods, such as low-level extraction, are either limited to older devices and iOS versions (currently, iOS 16.6.1 is the latest iOS build supported by iOS Forensic Toolkit) or legacy devices. Cloud-based analysis also presents challenges, as it requires full user credentials, and the device passcode is required on top of that to access end-to-end encrypted data.</p>

</p>
<p>Securing containerized applications demands a multi-layered strategy that spans the entire lifecycle from development to production, a challenge Aqua has spent nearly a decade mastering. Aqua’s Container Security solution provides full lifecycle protection by identifying vulnerabilities early in the build phase, integrating acceptance gates in the CI/CD pipeline to minimize risks, and offering real-time runtime protection in production environments. With the Aqua Platform, organizations can secure container workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, stop attacks as they happen, and maintain compliance, all without slowing development.</p>

		<p>A common question during a forensic investigation of a digital device is: &ldquo;<strong>Has the user ever used the XYZ application?</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As always when answering this question, it is important to create and follow a solid process.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to share a possible process that everyone should customize based on their needs and roles.</p>
<p>The ability to answer the question depends on the acquisition that was obtained from the device. In this blog post, I will address the scenario where you have a full file system acquisition (or physical, for older devices).</p>
