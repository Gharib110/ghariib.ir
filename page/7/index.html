<p>We may have found the killer app for AI. Well, actually, British telecom provider O2 has. As The Guardian reports, they have an AI chatbot that acts like a 78-year-old grandmother and receives phone calls. Of course, since the grandmother—Daisy, by name—doesn’t get any real phone calls, anyone calling that number is probably a scammer. Daisy’s specialty? Keeping them tied up on the phone.</p>
<p>While this might just seem like a prank for revenge, it is actually more than that. Scamming people is a numbers game. Most people won’t bite. So, to be successful, scammers have to make lots of calls. Daisy can keep one tied up for around 40 minutes or more.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Holistic Framework for Impossible Boomerang Attacks</strong><br>
<em>Yincen Chen, Qinggan Fu, Ning Zhao, Jiahao Zhao, Ling Song, Qianqian Yang</em></p>
<p>In 2011, Lu introduced the impossible boomerang attack at DCC. This powerful cryptanalysis technique combines the strengths of the impossible differential and boomerang attacks, thereby inheriting the advantages of both cryptographic techniques. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework comprising two generic and effective algorithms and a MILP-based model to search for the optimal impossible boomerang attack systematically. The first algorithm incorporates any key guessing strategy, while the second integrates the meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack into the key recovery process. Our framework is highly flexible, accommodating any set of attack parameters and returning the optimal attack complexity. When applying our framework to Deoxys-BC-256, Deoxys-BC-384, Joltik-BC-128, Joltik-BC-192, and SKINNYe v2, we achieve several significant improvements. We achieve the first 11-round impossible boomerang attacks on Deoxys-BC-256 and Joltik-BC-128. For SKINNYe v2, we achieve the first 33-round impossible boomerang attack, then using the MITM approach in the key recovery attack, the time complexity is significantly reduced. Additionally, for the 14-round Deoxys-BC-384 and Joltik-BC-192, the time complexity of the impossible boomerang attack is reduced by factors exceeding 2^{27} and 2^{12}, respectively.</p>

<p>The world of quantum physics is experiencing a second revolution, which will drive an exponential leap in the progress of computing, the internet, telecommunications, cybersecurity and biomedicine.</p>
<p>Quantum technologies are attracting more and more students who want to learn about concepts from the subatomic world—such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition —to explore the innovative potential of quantum science.</p>
<p>In fact, understanding the non-intuitive nature of quantum technology concepts and recognizing their relevance to technological progress is one of the challenges of 2025, declared the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology by UNESCO.</p>

<p>While we aren’t heavy-duty woodworkers, we occasionally make some sawdust as part of a project, and we admire people who know how to make wood and do what they want. We were surprised when [Newton Makes] showed a wooden dowel that was quite long and was mostly hollow. The wall was thin, the hole was perfectly centered, and he claimed he did not use a drill to produce it. Check it out in the video below and see what you think.</p>

		<p>In the modern era of cloud computing, deploying and managing resources efficiently is critical for organizations aiming to innovate quickly. With its robust suite of services like machine learning (ML) models, cognitive APIs and AI-powered applications, Azure AI has become popular for businesses looking to harness artificial intelligence (AI). However, manual deployment and management of these resources can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where Red HatAnsible Automation Platform comes into play.This blog explores how you can take advantage of Ansible Automation Platform to automate</p>

		<p>The architecture is designed to simulate a neural network with hierarchical memory management, dynamic adaptation, and performance optimization. The goal of this architecture is to present an alternative to modern neural models, which are often complex and resource-intensive, taking inspiration from our brains, neurons are decentralized organized in layers, allowing them to interact with themselves and change theirselves overtime in more than just sates and weights, while also creating a dynamic memory system.<br>

<p>Today’s security approach is siloed. Each deployed security tool is designed to provide a specific type of protection across different areas like the network, endpoints, email, and cloud environments. This hybrid methodology, often requiring dozens of systems, leads to several security and operational challenges for security operations center (SOC) and network operations center (NOC) teams. Adopting a hybrid environment is unavoidable, and Gartner[1] anticipates that “By 2025, over 50% of network firewall deployments will involve more than two deployment factors from the same vendor — up from less than 10% in 2023.” [1]  While the benefits of this new ecosystem are […]</p>
