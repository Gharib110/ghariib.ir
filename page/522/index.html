<p>The phenomenon of unsolicited and unwanted messaging dates back to the earliest communication platforms: from <a href="https://www.livescience.com/7028-ancient-cave-art-full-teenage-graffiti.html">prehistoric cave graffiti</a> and postal chain letters to popup ads and robocalls. To prevent spam, most online services rely on large-scale inspection of plaintext conversation content or detailed social-graph analysis to determine who is saying what to whom and whether or not that should be allowed. At Signal, we build on a foundation of privacy and do not have access to that type of data or metadata.</p>

<p>As the norms for how people connect have changed, much of the communication that once took place through the medium of coffee shops, bars, and parks now takes place through the medium of digital devices. One side effect of this shift from <em>analog</em> to <em>digital</em> is the conjoined shift from the <em>ephemeral</em> to the <em>eternal:</em> words once transiently spoken are now – more often than not – data stored forever.</p>
