<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 29, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is projected to cost the global economy a staggering $10.5 trillion annually by the end of 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015.</p>
<p>The rise of cybercrime has affected law enforcement agencies globally and India is no exception. Police forces are facing significant challenges as they grapple with the evolving nature of cyber threats and the increasing complexity of investigating and preventing cybercrimes. The sheer volume of cybercrimes in India, as recently recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India, is overwhelming.</p>

	<div>
		<p>So, let’s start with the basics: what is platform engineering and what led to its development? Platform engineering was developed in response to the increasing complexity of software development and the need for streamlined, efficient processes. In the early days of DevOps, a strict division existed between the developer (the person who created the software) and operations (the person who deployed and managed the software on a daily basis). Maintaining systems and infrastructure fell into a grey area for the developer— often the developer role had to sort out their own infrastructure and s</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Australian news outlet ABC NEWS analyzed a data set of 29 million 4-digit PIN numbers that people actually used to secure their devices, ATM withdrawals, building access, and more.</p>
<p>What the outlet discovered is both expected and disappointing: Too many people use insecure PIN codes to protect important parts of their lives.</p>
<p>Now, I feel compelled to add that I’ve always considered any four-digit string of numbers as simply too few numbers to secure anything important. It takes only 10,000 tries in a worst-case scenario for the attacker, which is not an awful lot for a determined—and sometimes machine-assisted—attacker.</p>

<p>DeepSeek has captured the world’s attention this week, with an unexpected release of the more-open AI model from China, for a reported mere $5 million training cost. While there’s lots of buzz about DeepSeek, here we’re interested in security. And DeepSeek has made waves there, in the form of a ClickHouse database unintentionally opened to the world, discovered by the folks from Wiz research. That database contained chat history and log streams, and API keys and other secrets by extension.</p>

The Thunderbird email client is making its monthly ‘release channel’ builds the default download starting in March. “We’re excited to announce that starting with the 135.0 release in March 2025, the Thunderbird Release channel will be the default download,” Corey Bryant, manager of Thunderbird Release Operations, shares in an update on the project’s discussion hub. Right now, users who visit the Thunderbird website and hit the giant download get the latest Extended Support Release (ESR) build by default. It gets one major feature update a year plus smaller bug fix and security updates issued in-between. The version of Thunderbird Ubuntu […]</p>

<p>Financially motivated hackers are behind an ongoing malicious campaign targeting Poland and Germany. These phishing attacks aim to deploy multiple payloads, including Agent Tesla, Snake Keylogger, and a novel backdoor dubbed TorNet, which is delivered via PureCrypter malware. </p>
<h2 id="detect-tornet-backdoor">Detect TorNet Backdoor</h2>
<p>A significant rise in phishing campaigns, with a 202% increase in phishing messages over the second half of 2024, indicates that this attack vector continues to be a persistent threat. The emergence of a TorNet backdoor distributed via PureCrypter malware in an ongoing phishing campaign, which uses advanced detection evasion techniques, requires swift and proactive responses from defenders. </p>
