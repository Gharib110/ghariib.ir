		<p>Cloud platforms like <strong>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud</strong>, alongside <strong>Microsoft 365 (M365)</strong>, have become the backbone of modern business operations. While these tools offer unparalleled scalability and collaboration, they also introduce unique security challenges. Misconfigurations, weak security settings, and overlooked compliance gaps can expose sensitive data, disrupt operations, and attract attackers.</p>
<p>This growing complexity demands more than traditional security approaches. That‚Äôs where <strong>MSI‚Äôs Cloud and M365 Configuration Review Services</strong> come in‚Äîhelping organizations identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and build stronger, more resilient cloud environments.</p>

		<p>Red Hat recently released an integration with PagerDuty, allowing events detected by Insights and the Hybrid Cloud Console (aka the console) to be sent from the console to PagerDuty. From the docs: ‚ÄúWhen an issue in the Hybrid Cloud Console is detected, PagerDuty automatically notifies the appropriate team members through phone calls, SMS, emails, or push notifications. PagerDuty uses scheduling to ensure team members are alerted only during their designated times. You can create escalation policies to escalate an issue to another team member if the first on-call team member does not respon</p>

	<div>
		<p>Modern software development emphasizes speed and agility, making efficient testing crucial. DORA research reveals that elite teams thrive with both high performance and reliability. They can achieve 127x faster lead times, 182x more deployments per year, 8x lower change failure rates and most impressively, 2,293x faster recovery times after incidents. The secret sauce is they ‚Äúshift left.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Shift-Left is a practice that moves integration activities like testing and security earlier in the development cycle, allowing teams to detect and fix issues before they reach production. By incorporating local and integration tests early, developers can prevent costly late-stage defects, accelerate development, and improve software quality.¬†</p>

<p>The post Sign in as anyone: Bypassing SAML SSO authentication with parser differentials appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-25291 + CVE-2025-25292) were discovered in ruby-saml up to version 1.17.0. Attackers who are in possession of a single valid signature that was created with the key used to validate SAML responses or assertions of the targeted organization can use it to construct SAML assertions themselves and are in turn able to log in as any user. In other words, it could be used for an account takeover attack. Users of ruby-saml should update to version 1.18.0. References to libraries making use of ruby-saml (such as omniauth-saml) need also be updated to a version that reference a fixed version of ruby-saml.</p>

<p>A new mass malware campaign is infecting users with a cryptocurrency miner named <strong>SilentCryptoMiner</strong> by masquerading it as a tool designed to circumvent internet blocks and restrictions around online services.</p>
<p>Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said the activity is part of a larger trend where cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging Windows Packet Divert (WPD) tools to distribute malware under the guise of restriction bypass programs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch software is often distributed in the form of archives with text installation instructions, in which the developers recommend disabling security solutions, citing false positives,‚Äù researchers Leonid Bezvershenko, Dmitry Pikush, and Oleg Kupreev said. ‚ÄúThis plays into the hands of attackers by allowing them to persist in an unprotected system without the risk of detection.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Executive summary:</strong><br>
Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified a shift in tactics by Silk Typhoon, a Chinese espionage group, now targeting common IT solutions like remote management tools and cloud applications to gain initial access. While they haven‚Äôt been observed directly targeting Microsoft cloud services, they do exploit unpatched applications that allow them to elevate their access in targeted organizations and conduct further malicious activities. After successfully compromising a victim, Silk Typhoon uses the stolen keys and credentials to infiltrate customer networks where they can then abuse a variety of deployed applications, including Microsoft services and others, to achieve their espionage objectives. Our latest blog explains how Microsoft security solutions detect these threats and offers mitigation guidance, aiming to raise awareness and strengthen defenses against Silk Typhoon‚Äôs activities.</p>

		<p>Excellent read. One example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the case of basic public key cryptography, in which a person‚Äôs public and private key are created together in a single operation. These two keys are entangled, not with quantum physics, but with math.</p>
<p>When I create a virtual machine server in the Amazon cloud, I am prompted for an RSA public key that will be used to control access to the machine. Typically, I create the public and private keypair on my laptop and upload the public key to Amazon, which bakes my public key into the server‚Äôs administrator account. My laptop and that remove server are thus entangled, in that the only way to log into the server is using the key on my laptop. And because that administrator account can do anything to that server¬≠‚Äîread the sensitivity data, hack the web server to install malware on people who visit its web pages, or anything else I might care to do¬≠‚Äîthe private key on my laptop represents a security risk for that server&hellip;</p>
