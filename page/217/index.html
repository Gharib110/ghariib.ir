<p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), set to become fully enforceable on January 17, 2025, represents a significant evolution in the regulatory landscape for financial institutions operating within, or engaging with, the European Union (EU). Although DORA is primarily targeted at entities within the EU, its implications extend globally, notably impacting U.S.-based banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) organizations that have business relationships with EU financial institutions. </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Triple Ratchet: A Bandwidth Efficient Hybrid-Secure Signal Protocol</strong><br>
<em>Yevgeniy Dodis, Daniel Jost, Shuichi Katsumata, Thomas Prest, Rolfe Schmidt</em></p>
<p>Secure Messaging apps have seen growing adoption, and are used by billions of people daily. However, due to imminent threat of a &ldquo;Harvest Now, Decrypt Later&rdquo; attack, secure messaging providers must react know in order to make their protocols $textit{hybrid-secure}$: at least as secure as before, but now also post-quantum (PQ) secure. Since many of these apps are internally based on the famous Signal&rsquo;s Double-Ratchet (DR) protocol, making Signal hybrid-secure is of great importance.</p>

		<p>I have recently discovered <code>ctypes</code> and decided to use it to manipulate Python in a way I should not. The purpose was to see some of the <em>Python&rsquo;s internals</em> at work directly from the interpreter.<br>
The article studies to the <code>CPython</code> implementation of Python 2.7.</p>
<h2 id="reference-counting-and-the-garbage-collector">Reference counting and the Garbage Collector</h2>
<p>One thing to know about Python is that its Garbage Collector uses reference counting. It means that every Python object has a <em>ref counter</em> that knows how many references are pointing to the object.<br>
Our first goal is to visualise that <em>ref counter</em> for any object from the Python interpreter.</p>

		<p>After my first article I kept playing with <code>ctypes</code> and tried to see what fun things that could be possible with little modifications to the Python&rsquo;s objects at runtime. The goal of this article is to explain how to <strong>get reliable native code execution as a simple Python objet</strong>. By reliable I mean: that, if our payload respect certain rules, we can call it multiple times from the same Python code.</p>

		<p>Lately, I have been looking at the Python&rsquo;s execution model. I was curious about the implementation of some opcodes like <code>YIELD_VALUE</code> and <code>YIELD_FROM</code>, how were compiled list comprehensions, generator expressions and other fun Python features, and what happens at the bytecode level when exceptions were raised. Reading the <code>CPython</code> code is really instructive, but I was feeling like something was missing to fully understand the bytecode execution and the stack evolution. Yeah, <code>GDB</code> is cool but I&rsquo;m a lazy guy who wanted a high-level interface and code some Python.</p>

	<div>
		<p>When it comes to tech careers, web development and software development often get tossed around like they&rsquo;re the same thing. But they&rsquo;re not. Web development is like crafting the storefront of a shop, making it look good and work well for customers. Software development, on the other hand, is like building tools and applications that people use, whether on a computer, phone, or other devices. Both are super important in the tech world, but they require different skills and focus on different things. Let&rsquo;s dive into what sets them apart and what you need to know if you&rsquo;re thinking about a career in either field.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The GPG key used to sign the Firefox release manifests is expiring soon, and so we’re going to be switching over to new key shortly.</p>
<p>The new GPG fingerprint is <code>14F2 6682 D091 6CDD 81E3 7B6D 61B7 B526 D98F 0353</code> and its subkey’s fingerprint is <code>ADD7 0794 7970 0DCA DFDD 5337 E36D 3B13 F3D9 3274</code>, and it expires <code>2025-05-04</code>.</p>
<p>The public key can be fetched from KEY files from the latest Firefox Nightly, keys.openpgp.org, or from below. This can be used to validate existing releases signed with the current key, or future releases signed with the new key.</p>

		<p>In accordance with the Mozilla Manifesto, which emphasizes the open development of policy that protects users’ privacy and security, we have worked with the Mozilla community over the past several months to improve the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) so that we can now announce version 2.8, effective June 1, 2022. These policy changes aim to improve the transparency of Certificate Authority (CA) operations and the certificates that they issue. A detailed comparison of the policy changes may be found here, and the significant policy changes that appear in this version are:</p>
