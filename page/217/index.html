<p><strong>High Cohesion</strong> (Tính liên kết cao) là một nguyên tắc quan trọng trong thiết kế phần mềm hướng đối tượng. Nguyên tắc này đảm bảo rằng mỗi lớp hoặc module chỉ chịu trách nhiệm cho một nhóm nhỏ các chức năng liên quan chặt chẽ với nhau. Mục tiêu của nguyên lý này là tạo ra các lớp dễ duy trì, dễ hiểu và có thể tái sử dụng cao.</p>

In those two weeks (just 10 working days), you’ll need to collate a huge amount of evidence to show you’re meeting minimum security standards. We’re talking about risk assessment records, an overview of all your security […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Parametrizing Maximal Orders Along Supersingular $ell$-Isogeny Paths</strong><br>
<em>Laia Amorós, James Clements, Chloe Martindale</em></p>
<p>Suppose you have a supersingular $ell$-isogeny graph with vertices given by $j$-invariants defined over $mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, where $p = 4 cdot f cdot ell^e - 1$ and $ell equiv 3 pmod{4}$. We give an explicit parametrization of the maximal orders in $B_{p,infty}$ appearing as endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves in this graph that are $leq e$ steps away from a root vertex with $j$-invariant 1728. This is the first explicit parametrization of this kind and we believe it will be an aid in better understanding the structure of supersingular $ell$-isogeny graphs that are widely used in cryptography. Our method makes use of the inherent directions in the supersingular isogeny graph induced via Bruhat-Tits trees, as studied in [1]. We also discuss how in future work other interesting use cases, such as $ell=2$, could benefit from the same methodology.</p>

		<p>Job Posting: <strong>PhD in Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>King&rsquo;s College London</em></p>
<p>We are inviting applications for a PhD studentship in the cryptography lab at King&rsquo;s College London. Specifically, we are looking for an applicant to work with Martin Albrecht and Benjamin Dowling.</p>
<p>The PhD could, for example, cover cryptanalysing existing cryptographic technologies/protocols, such as Telegram or WhatsApp, or modelling and designing new cryptographic protocols or primitives.</p>
<p>This PhD will work in a team consisting of social scientists, specifically ethnographers, and us cryptographers. Together, we study what the security needs and wants of participants in large-scale protests are and how these relate to the security guarantees provided by cryptographic solutions.</p>

Raspberry Pi has today announced the launch of a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB RAM. A engorged-memory model had been oft-rumoured since the launch of the raspberry Pi 5 in 2024 – and long-desired by fans of this particular single-board computer (SBC). The launch of the new Raspberry Pi CM5 late last year offers up to 16GB RAM whilst utilising the same underlying chipset as the Pi 5, all but confirming a bumper RAM revision for the full-size board was imminent. Why didn’t they launch a 16GB model right away? It’s only with last year’s minor revision to the Broadcom […]</p>
