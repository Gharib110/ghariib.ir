		<p>For decades users have been pressing Ctrl+C or relying on copy buttons. All these tricks and shortcuts to speed up text processing have become natural and intuitive to us. We do not pay attention to what is happening to copied information besides the fact that we can paste it. It’s safe to assume that most of us consider the clipboard as temporary data sharing. Once you copy something previous data in the clipboard will be overwritten. People rely on this assumption when they copy sensitive information such as passwords.</p>

		<p>In our daily botnet analysis work, it is common to encounter various loaders.Compared to other types of malware, loaders are unique in that they are mainly used to &ldquo;promote&rdquo;, i.e., download and run other malware on the infected machine. According to our observations, most loaders are proprietary and have a binding relationship with the family they are promoting. A few loader families make themselves into promotion platforms that can spread any other malware family, achieving the so-called malware-as-a-service (MaaS). Compared with proprietary loaders, MaaS types are obviously more dangerous and should be our primary target of concern.</p>

<p>With so much data being thrown at our eyeballs these days, it’s worryingly easy for the actually important stuff to slip by occasionally. So when [Liam Jackson] wanted a way to visualize the number of test failures popping up in the continuous integration system at work, he went with a novel but effective solution — universal motorcycle tachometers.</p>
<p>It turns out these little gauges can be had for under $10 a piece from the usual overseas retailers, and are very easy to drive with a microcontroller. As [Liam] explains, all you need to do other than providing them with 12 volts, is feed them a PWM signal. Even though the gauges are designed for a 12 V system, they apparently don’t have any problem responding to the 5 V logic level from the Arduino’s pins.</p>

	<div>
		<p>At Mozilla, we believe in an open web that is safe to use. To that end, we improve and maintain the security of people using Firefox around the world. This includes a solid track record of responding to security bugs in the wild, especially with bug bounty programs such as Pwn2Own. As soon as we discover a critical security issue in Firefox, we plan and ship a rapid fix. This post describes how we recently fixed an exploit discovered at Pwn2Own in less than 21 hours, a success only made possible through the collaborative and well-coordinated efforts of a global cross-functional team of release and QA engineers, security experts, and other stakeholders.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In our continued efforts to improve the security of the web PKI, we are taking a multi-pronged approach to tackling some long-existing problems with revocation of TLS server certificates. In addition to our ongoing CRLite work, we added new requirements to version 2.8 of Mozilla’s Root Store Policy that will enable Firefox to depend on revocation reason codes being used consistently, so they can be relied on when verifying the validity of certificates during TLS connections. We also added a new requirement that CA operators provide their full CRL URLs in the CCADB. This will enable Firefox to pre-load more complete certificate revocation data, eliminating dependency on the infrastructure of CAs during the certificate verification part of establishing TLS connections. The combination of these two new sets of requirements will further enable Firefox to enforce revocation checking of TLS server certificates, which makes TLS connections even more secure.</p>

<p>As your city adopts Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to enhance mobility and safety, securing these interconnected networks is more critical than ever. The distributed nature of ITS networks, IT-OT convergence, limited physical security controls, and vulnerabilities in interconnected IoT devices can pose significant challenges. When physical and operational systems converge, the risks grow – cyberattacks can have real-world consequences.</p>
<p>If you manage transportation systems, you face fragmented tools and siloed approaches among government agencies, private operators and vendors. This lack of coordination complicates the protection of real-time critical operations. Meanwhile, railroads and public transit remain prime targets for operational disruption, financial harm and geopolitical agendas, with nearly a third of threats coming from insiders.</p>

		<p>Cloud-native infrastructure is still evolving, and one thing that&rsquo;s clear is the need for scalability and efficiency in managing your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. Hosted control planes (HCP) is a paradigm-shifting approach in OpenShift designed to optimize the way control planes are deployed and operated. For cluster service providers operating Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift, the HCP model aligns perfectly with the demands of modern infrastructure. By separating concerns of management and workloads, providers can achieve better resource utilization with high density control, help ensur</p>

<h2 id="detection-content-creation-submission--release">Detection Content Creation, Submission &amp; Release</h2>
<p>December was another impressive month for the Threat Bounty Program, with the community showcasing a collaborative spirit and detection engineering skills.</p>
<p>Despite the end-of-year hustle, Program members continued actively submitting detections to address emerging threats. In total, 33 new detection rules were successfully released to the SOC Prime Platform after being validated by the team of SOC Prime’s experts.</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-changes-and-program-enhancements">Ongoing Changes and Program Enhancements</h2>
<p>Starting January 2025, we have temporarily suspended the acceptance of new Threat Bounty detections. While the <strong>Threat Bounty Program activities are on hold</strong>, we are working on several enhancements to the SOC Prime Platform that aim to improve the overall experience for all users and extend opportunities for Threat Bounty Program members, including submission of content across different formats and additional ways to monetize your work. See details here.</p>
