<p>In my previous blog, we ran through what NIS2 is and who it applies to. In this second part of the series, I’ll break down the main requirements you’ll find in NIS2 and help translate them into actionable and practical measures you can take to achieve NIS2 compliance. Join me in this post and start understanding what NIS2 is all about.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, you probably came to the conclusion that EU NIS2 is applicable to your company. Let’s dig into the requirements and what you need to do to become compliant.</p>

<p>If you love reading books and have yet to experience an e-reader, we highly recommend giving it a try. Not only are you able to carry thousands of books on a single device, but it&rsquo;s also better for the eyes when compared to a tablet or smartphone. Of course, there are lots of different options out there, but we recommend going with Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-13375<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 18, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 21 hours, 53 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Adifier System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user&rsquo;s identity prior to updating their details like password through the adifier_recover() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user&rsquo;s passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 9.8 | CRITICAL<br>

<p>Healthcare entities have a 51% probability of falling victim to phishing attacks. Successful incidents not only lead to control over systems, but can also expose patient health information, financial and insurance data. Healthcare providers are seeing an 81% uptick in threats, especially as cyber criminals weaponize increasingly advanced methods, and some organizations are struggling to keep pace. With over 265 clinic locations across the United States and a mission to deliver high-quality, accessible and compassionate care to under-served communities, Fast Pace Health recently found itself ill-equipped to fend off high volumes of relentless cyber threats. On account of overseeing large […]</p>

<p>Researchers hope to mimic how squid and octopus use RNA editing in nerve channels that interpret pain and use that knowledge to manipulate human cells.</p>

<p>We’ve seen similar projects in the past, but they’ve required some additional code running on the computer to bridge the gap between the Pico and your debugging software of choice. But [Surya] says this project works out of the box with common tools such as OpenOCD and pyOCD.</p>

<p>Kodi, the popular free open-source home theater software, released new 21.2 version today with many improvements and tons of bug-fixes.</p>
<p>First, the new Kodi 21.2 features <strong>significant speed increase of library scans</strong> (back to v20 level) as well as faster artwork caching.</p>

<p>For Linux users, the new release enabled/fixed HDR to SDR tone mapping on video sources with partial or missing display metadata, fixed HDR passthrough for HDR videos that didn’t switch TV into HDR mode, and fixed issue that windowed Kodi doubled in size on every start when using Wayland with a scaling factor &gt; 100%.</p>

		<p>The productivity suite is now out of Office.</p>
<p>Back in December, Microsoft gave out a small warning. It stated that it planned to rebrand its entire productivity line from &ldquo;Microsoft 365 Office&rdquo; to &ldquo;Microsoft 365 Copilot,&rdquo; and people didn&rsquo;t really gel with the idea. Well, seems Microsoft didn&rsquo;t really care, as it has given the green light to begin rebranding everyone&rsquo;s apps to a more Copilot-focused brand.</p>

		<p>I am always interested in new phishing tricks, and watching them spread across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>A few days ago I started getting phishing SMS messages with a new twist. They were standard messages about delayed packages or somesuch, with the goal of getting me to click on a link and entering some personal information into a website. But because they came from unknown phone numbers, the links did not work. So—this is the new bit—the messages said something like: “Please reply Y, then exit the text message, reopen the text message activation link, or copy the link to Safari browser to open it.”&hellip;</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become an enterprise’s go-to platform for orchestrating and managing container workloads for cloud-native software. As more organizations adopt it and cloud-native software scales and becomes more complex, the need for container security is high. Kubernetes and container workloads have become a prime enterprise attack surface—67% of organizations delayed or slowed down deployment due to Kubernetes security concerns. There are numerous choices for container security. What sets Check Point CloudGuard apart? Its unique two-axes defense-in-depth approach scans, protects, and detects across an enterprise’s entire container environment. Think of it like this: one axis spans the software development lifecycle (SDLC), […]</p>
