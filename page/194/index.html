		<p>Nothing ever truly dies on the internet and these retro operating systems are live and kicking and ready for you to use.</p>
<p>Retro gaming is having a huge revival right now, with hardware emulating classic consoles so you can use original cartridges, to emulators to create retro PCs, and Atari releasing a modern version of the 7800 from the mid-80s for you to use any old cartridges you still have in the attic. It&rsquo;s a fantastic time to be a classic gaming fan, but what about the operating systems that we used to use?</p>

	<div>
		<p>The eGPU market has been stagnant for years but I believe it&rsquo;s ready to rumble again.</p>
<p>When first introduced to the market, external graphics cards or eGPUs were hailed as the savior of gaming on the go, able to increase the graphical power of the best laptops by offloading the processing to the eGPU. While this was a fantastic idea in theory, the practical applications and slower connectivity standards of the time conspired to make them lackluster at best, and the market went stagnant. Most of the eGPU enclosures available now were released years ago, and the manufacturers haven&rsquo;t really been in a rush to release updated versions.</p>

	<div>
		<p>2025 is the year your NAS setup gets smarter</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways your typical home NAS differs from its enterprise counterpart, most of which have to do with how the NAS holds, processes, and distributes data. Unlike home users, businesses face far more advanced and taxing needs — managing multiple users, applications, and environments. To handle all this complexity, it is crucial for businesses to leverage all the tools at their disposal to maximize the potential of their NAS while ensuring quick accessibility, data safety, and readiness for any data crisis.</p>

<p>If you have been a long-time Windows user, you are likely familiar with using the Command Prompt for your command-line interface (CLI) work. However, the utility you should be using is PowerShell. It is a far more powerful command line tool for Windows and beyond.</p>

		<p>Excel tips that will save you hours</p>
<p>While we rely on Excel for everything from simple budgeting to complex data analysis, many of us are still stuck using the same basic functions and tricks we learned years ago. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Over the years, I have discovered a treasure trove of hidden shortcuts, clever tips, and time-saving techniques that have transformed the way I use Excel.</p>

		<p>If you love modding your PC, you should seriously consider investing in a 3D printer</p>
<p>Hey, PC enthusiasts, have you ever considered using 3D printing to customize your PC? It’s not just for modding your gaming rig; it can also help with maintenance and upgrades. 3D printing lets you create custom parts and accessories on the fly, experiment with new case designs, and even customize your whole system to suit your unique needs.</p>

<p>A fantastic use case for AI Coding Assistants is upgrading applications to modern and supported versions of programming languages, libraries and frameworks. All too often, engineering effort is spent building new features, whilst existing applications are left untouched, until they become unsupported with all kinds of inherent vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><code>Amazon Q Developer</code> introduced a code transformation agent for Java when launched in preview back in November 2023. This agent has undergone multiple iterations and become more accurate and powerful since then. On 3rd December 2024 at AWS re:Invent, the public preview of new transformation capabilities for .NET, mainframe, and VMware workloads was announced.</p>

<p>When the Game Boy Printer was released back in 1998, being able to produce a hard-copy of your <em>Pokémon</em> diploma or your latest Game Boy Camera snapshot at the touch of a button was was pretty slick indeed. But in our modern paperless society, the GB Printer somehow sticks out as even more archaic than the other add-on’s for Nintendo’s iconic handheld. Even among the folks who are still proudly playing the games that support the Printer, nobody actually wants to print anything out — although that doesn’t mean they don’t want to see the images.</p>

<p>Open source is one of the most exciting, but often misunderstood, innovations of our modern world. I still remember the first time I installed linux on my laptop, saw the vast array of packages I could install on it, all the utilities and libraries that make it work, all the forum threads filled with advice and debugging and troubleshooting, and I thought:</p>
<p><em>“Wait, all of this is</em> <strong><em>free</em></strong><em>???”</em></p>
<p>It’s free, you can use it, and it’s awesome. But you can go a surprisingly long time and still feel like you only have a vague idea of what “open source” actually means. It can take a while to get used to the jargon, the controversies, and the technical details.</p>

</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of Bambu Lab’s announcement that it would be locking down all network access to its X1-series 3D printers with new firmware, the X.509 certificate and private key from the Bambu Connect application have now been extracted by [hWuxH]. This application was intended to be the sole way for third-party software to send print jobs to Bambu Lab hardware as we previously reported.</p>
<p>The Bambu Connect app is a fairly low-effort Electron-based affair, with some attempt at obfuscation and encryption, but not enough to keep prying eyes out. The de-obfuscated <code>main.js</code> file can be found here (archived), with the certificate and private key clearly visible. These are used to encrypt HTTP traffic with the printer, and is the sole thing standing in the way of tools like OrcaSlicer talking with authentication-enabled Bambu Lab printers.</p>
