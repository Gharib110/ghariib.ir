<p>Ransomware attacks are no longer about locking files and demanding payment. Cybercriminals have evolved, using speed, scale, and advanced tools to exploit human vulnerabilities like never before. These attacks don’t just rely on technology—they manipulate people, leveraging social engineering tactics like smishing, vishing, and AI-enabled OSINT (open-source intelligence) to deceive and infiltrate organizations.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the 20th edition of the Cloudflare DDoS Threat Report, marking five years since our first report in 2020.</p>
<p>Published quarterly, this report offers a comprehensive analysis of the evolving threat landscape of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks based on data from the Cloudflare network. In this edition, we focus on the fourth quarter of 2024 and look back at the year as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflares-unique-vantage-point">Cloudflare’s unique vantage point</h2>
<p>When we published our first report, Cloudflare’s global network capacity was 35 Terabits per second (Tbps). Since then, our network’s capacity has grown by 817% to 321 Tbps. We also significantly expanded our global presence by 65% from 200 cities in the beginning of 2020 to 330 cities by the end of 2024.</p>

A clutch of new customisation and configuration options were added to Refine, a GTK4/libadwaita app in the vein of GNOME Tweaks (but better), over the weekend. Refine is compelling due to its goal of offering the “convenience to add or remove options without touching a single line of source code” — though for a GUI option to exist it must be hooking into a variable within GNOME, i.e., it can’t magic up a toggle to make it rain glitter! A brief bit of turbulence ensnared those attempting to run the tool on Ubuntu after I covered it in early January […]</p>

	<b><time>22.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Generative AI applications have become powerful tools for creating human-like content, but they also introduce new security challenges, including prompt injections, excessive agency, and others. See the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications to learn more about the unique security risks associated with generative AI applications. When you integrate large language models (LLMs) into your organizational workflows and customer-facing applications, it becomes crucial for you to understand and mitigate prompt injection risks. Developing a comprehensive threat model for your applications that use generative AI can help you identify potential vulnerabilities related to prompt injection, such as unauthorized data access. To assist in this effort, AWS provides a range of generative AI security strategies that you can use to create appropriate threat models.</p>
