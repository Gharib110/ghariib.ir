	<div>
		<p>On December 15, we detected a malicious campaign targeting Kaiser Permanente employees via Google Search Ads. The fraudulent ad masquerades as the health care company’s HR portal used to check for benefits, download paystubs and other corporate related tasks.</p>
<p>We believe the threat actors’ intent was to phish KP employees for their login credentials, but something unexpected happened. Instead, victims who clicked on the ad were redirected to a compromised website that prompted them to update their browser.</p>

		<p>Mamont banker is distributed under the guise of an application for tracking the delivery of goods offered at wholesale prices.</p>
<p>We’ve discovered a new scheme of distribution of the Mamont (Russian for mammoth) Trojan banker. Scammers promise to deliver a certain product at wholesale prices that may be considered interesting to small businesses as well as private buyers, and offer to install an Android application to track the package. However, instead of a tracking utility, the victim installs a Trojan that can steal banking credentials, push notifications, and other financial information.</p>

	<div>
		<p>One of the hardest parts of managing an organization’s cybersecurity is patch management. Just as one patch cycle is completed, another set of patches are released. When compounded with the highly regulated energy industry, governed by the NERC CIP Standards, the task becomes even more daunting. Fortunately, Fortra’s Tripwire Enterprise (TE) and Tripwire State Analyzer (TSA) can ease the process. Some of the specified requirements align directly with the capabilities of TE, For example, the rationale section of CIP-010-4 R1 states that “the configuration change management processes are&hellip;</p>

	<div>
		<p>In modern software development, businesses are searching for smarter ways to streamline workflows and deliver value faster. For developers, this means tackling challenges like collaboration and security head-on, while driving efficiency that contributes directly to business performance. But how do you address potential roadblocks before they become costly issues in production? The answer lies in optimizing the development inner loop — a core focus for the future of app development.</p>

		<p>Technical and organizational precautions when deploying existing AI systems and developing new ones</p>
<p>Today, AI-based technologies are already being used in every second company — with another 33% of commercial organizations expected to join them in the next two years. AI, in one form or another, will soon be ubiquitous. The economic benefits of adopting AI range from increased customer satisfaction to direct revenue growth. As businesses deepen their understanding of AI systems’ strengths and weaknesses, their effectiveness will only improve. However, it’s already clear that the risks associated with AI adoption need to be addressed proactively.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This article is an overview of memory management in Java. It explains key components of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), including the stack, heap, and garbage collection.</p>
<p>Memory management in Java is essential for various reasons. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automates memory handling by utilizing stack, heap, and garbage collection system. This lightens the load on developers by taking care of memory allocation and deallocation. Nonetheless, developers can not overlook memory management entirely. See the definitions for JVM, stack, heap, and garbage collection at the end of the post.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The Internet is designed to provide multiple paths between two endpoints. Attempts to exploit multi-path opportunities are almost as old as the Internet, culminating in RFCs documenting some of the challenges. Still, today, virtually all end-to-end communication uses only one available path at a time. Why? It turns out that in multi-path setups, even the smallest differences between paths can harm the connection quality due to packet reordering and other issues. As a result, Internet devices usually use a single path and let the routers handle the path selection.</p>
