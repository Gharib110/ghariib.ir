		<p>Hi there! I&rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>
<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators.</p>

		<p>According to information from our intelligence network, ICA is working on a secret project. We need to find out what the project is. Once you have the access information, send them to us. We will place a backdoor to access the system later. You just focus on what the project is. You will probably have to go through several layers of security. The Agency has full confidence that you will successfully complete this mission. Good Luck, Agent!</p>

</p>
<p>This is a step by step beginner’s guide shows how to install the most recent Arduino IDE (2.3.4 so far) in Ubuntu, Debian, and Linux Mint.</p>
<p>Arduino IDE is free open-source AVR development board IDE from Arduino CC. It’s available in Debian and Ubuntu repositories, but stuck at version 1.8.19, probably because the 2.x versions require internet connection.</p>
<p>If you want to get the 2.x release series, then there are 3 choices: <strong>Flatpak</strong>, <strong>AppImage</strong>, and portable <strong>Linux Zip archive</strong> that work in most Linux distributions.</p>

<p>At the onset of the Civil War, a man whose name would eventually become synonymous with famous American detectives was reportedly providing false reports to the Union’s top general. Allan Pinkerton, who once successfully smuggled Abraham Lincoln into Washington, D.C. to avoid a rumored assassination attempt before he was even sworn in as president, acted as General George McClellan’s top intelligence officer. He was considered one of the best spymasters in the United States, responsible for effectively founding the nation’s first secret service.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Cloudflare Radar celebrated its fourth birthday in September 2024. As we’ve expanded Radar’s scope over the last four years, the value that it provides as a resource for the <strong>global</strong> Internet has grown over time, and with Radar data and graphs often appearing in publications and social media around the world, we knew that we needed to make it available in languages beyond English.</p>
<p>Localization is important because most Internet users do not speak English as a first language. According to W3Techs, English usage on the Internet has dropped 8.3 points (57.7% to 49.4%) since January 2023, whereas usage of other languages like Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch is steadily increasing. Furthermore, a CSA Research study determined that 65% of Internet users prefer content in their language.</p>

	<div>
		<p>We’re pleased to announce an enhanced version of the AWS Secrets Manager transform: <code>AWS::SecretsManager-2024-09-16</code>. This update is designed to simplify infrastructure management by reducing the need for manual security updates, bug fixes, and runtime upgrades.</p>
<p>AWS Secrets Manager helps you manage, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycles. Some AWS services offer managed rotation of secrets, but for other secrets, you perform rotation by using an AWS Lambda function that updates your secret and the database or service.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re a marketer in 2024, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone suggests a podcast. 😅 In fact, you might be working on your company&rsquo;s podcast right now, or listening to one as you cruise your inbox.</p>
<p>Well, here at Giant Swarm, we&rsquo;ve taken the podcast plunge ourselves. But our journey into the world of podcasting isn&rsquo;t your typical marketing strategy, or at least that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re telling ourselves. It&rsquo;s a story of experimentation and a genuine desire to connect in a more human way. Plus, it’s really fun to find a jingle on Fiverr each week… </p>
