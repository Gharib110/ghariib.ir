<p>Apache Kafka is a powerful distributed messaging system, but like any system, it can face performance bottlenecks. One of the most common challenges is Kafka lag—the delay between producing and consuming messages. Addressing Kafka lag is crucial for maintaining real-time data pipelines and ensuring optimal performance. In this article, we explore practical strategies to reduce Kafka lag and achieve efficient message processing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-kafka-lag">What is Kafka Lag?</h2>
<p>Kafka lag refers to the difference between the latest offset produced and the offset currently consumed by a consumer. It serves as a critical metric to measure how well a consumer group is keeping up with message production. High lag indicates delays in processing, which can disrupt real-time systems and lead to stale or outdated data insights.</p>

<p>Sometimes when working with fields in SPL, it can be useful to search for and replace parts of text found in the field. Some reasons for doing this might be:<br>
– removing white space to reduce the size of the field<br>
– replacing field separators with characters that look nicer<br>
– rearranging values in a field in an order that is more appropriate (displaying names as first, last or last, first)</p>

		<p>The last two months have seen the release of three new U.S. Government documents related to software security:</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Cybersecurity Strategy released in early March covers the landscape of cybersecurity concerns and introduces the concept of shifting the liability for insecure software products and services from consumers to suppliers.</li>
<li>In mid-April, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and cybersecurity agencies of several other countries, released a paper titled “Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security-by-Design and -Default.”, which reinforced some aspects of the National Cybersecurity Strategy but also added additional requirements and expectations.</li>
<li>And in late April, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CISA released a “Secure Software Development Attestation Form” that organizations that supply software to the government will be required to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>These documents could have a significant impact on the operations of software developers that sell to the government, both in the near term and for the foreseeable future. In this blog, we’ll review some key points of each and discuss their relationship to each other, to the US Presidential Executive Order 14028 released in May 2021 on improving the nation’s cybersecurity, and to the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF). Then we’ll provide some SAFECode comments on the relationship among the documents, and recommendations on the way that the government should use them.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In our previous blog posts, we defined the code integrity problem statement and the basic principles of code integrity. As our series continues, we will define a framework of layered security capabilities to support code integrity. The framework is based on security capabilities that involve an intersection of tools, people, and processes.</p>

		<p>Some time ago, I spent some time researching a core SolarWinds product, SolarWinds Platform (previously Orion Platform). At that time, I hadn’t been aware of the SolarWinds Access Right Manager product (Solar Winds ARM).</p>
<p>Afterward, Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative began receiving submissions of vulnerabilities in Access Rights Manager (ARM). The first submissions we received were from Sina Kheirkhah (@SinSinology), and one of those was a pre-auth RCE based on the .NET Remoting service. After his issues were patched, we received some additional, anonymous reports, in which pre-auth RCE was achieved via an unauthenticated gRPC/.NET Remoting based service on port 55555/tcp. An unauthenticated attacker was able to call its many methods, which were vulnerable mainly due to:</p>

<p>Security experts have uncovered a novel Strela Stealer campaign, which leverages a new iteration of email credential-stealing malware. In this campaign, the updated malware version is enriched with enhanced functionality and is now capable of gathering system configuration data via the “system info” utility. Moreover, Strela Stealer expanded its targets beyond Spain, Italy, and Germany to set eyes on Ukraine.</p>
<h2 id="strela-stealer-attacks-detection">Strela Stealer Attacks Detection</h2>
<p>Every day, approximately 560,000 new pieces of malware are detected, according to Statista. This highlights the ever-growing attack surface, which poses a significant challenge for cybersecurity defenders. To outscale cyber threats and detect malicious attacks on time, cyber defenders can rely on SOC Prime Platform offering a complete product suite for advanced threat detection and hunting. </p>

	<a href="/tags/penetrationtesting">penetrationtesting</a>
	
	<div>
		<p>Researchers have discovered a new attack named <strong>SysBumps</strong>, which targets macOS systems running on Apple Silicon processors. This attack leverages speculative execution vulnerabilities in system calls to bypass critical security measures such as <strong>Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR)</strong> and kernel isolation. KASLR, a crucial defense mechanism, randomizes the memory layout of the kernel, making it harder for attackers to predict the location of specific functions or data structures. By breaking KASLR, attackers can more easily exploit other vulnerabilities, significantly compromising macOS system security.</p>
