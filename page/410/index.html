		<p>Good security reporting is crucial to maintain a good security posture because it provides detailed insights into incidents. With this information, organizations can better understand vulnerabilities, improve defenses, and prevent similar threats in the future. At GitLab, the Security division has created use cases for GitLab Duo to improve reporting capabilities and enhance operational efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="gitlab-duos-security-capabilities">GitLab Duo’s security capabilities</h2>
<p>The GitLab Security division uses GitLab’s built-in incidents to manage and report on security incidents. Incidents are handled, documented, and resolved in GitLab, enabling the use of AI-driven GitLab Duo as an assistant when performing security operations like incident response.</p>

		<p>In our November LinkedIn Live broadcast, we brought together field CTOs, developer advocates, and community leaders to discuss industry trends and showcase features making a difference in developer workflows.</p>
<p>Here are 5 key highlights:</p>
<h3 id="1-ai-adoption-trends-from-the-field">1. AI adoption trends from the field</h3>
<p>Our field CTOs shared insights on how organizations are embracing AI across their development workflows. For instance, Field CTO Cherry Han highlighted how financial organizations are thinking beyond individual developer tools.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In our previous post, we talked about creating an AI agent for technical communities that can use the conversation history amongst colleagues and other members to answer the user’s common questions. InSightful is the agent we built that uses the Reasoning and Action (ReAct) approach to respond to user queries accurately. However, during the retrieval process the generalization of the retrieved information causes the agent to provide a high-level overview of the information. You can greatly improve the results of the retrieved information from the conversation history within a community by retrieving relevant <strong>specific</strong> information according to a query. This can be achieved with a reranker.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At DigitalOcean, we understand that efficiently scaling your infrastructure is key to delivering seamless, high-performance applications. That’s why we’re excited to introduce Droplet Autoscale Pools, a new feature that automates the scaling of your Droplets based on how they’re using resources. Droplet Autoscaling helps ensure that businesses only pay for the compute resources they need, meeting performance demands without manual scaling interventions. Whether you’re handling traffic spikes or fluctuating workloads, this feature helps you scale your infrastructure dynamically and cost-effectively, so you can focus on what matters most—building and growing your business.</p>

	<div>
		<p>We’re excited to announce two powerful new features for DigitalOcean’s App Platform: <strong>Maintenance Mode</strong> and <strong>Restart Apps</strong>! These updates give you greater flexibility and control over your applications, making it easier than ever to manage maintenance tasks and optimize performance.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-mode-seamless-maintenance-minimal-disruption">Maintenance Mode: Seamless Maintenance, Minimal Disruption</h2>
<p>Maintenance Mode allows you to temporarily take your app offline while ensuring users are informed. Instead of users encountering errors or incomplete updates, they’ll see a maintenance page on your app’s home screen.</p>

		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming industries, from automotive to finance. Since the advent of using GPUs for AI/ML workloads in the last few years, processing large amounts of data has become significantly faster. Workload orchestrators like Kubernetes have also played an important role in maximizing GPU compute power.</p>
<p>However, one of the critical bottlenecks in this process is often the networking infrastructure. AI/ML training and inference workloads require the rapid and reliable transfer of massive datasets. Even the most powerful GPUs can be underutilized without an optimized networking setup, leading to significant delays and inefficiencies.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The world is fast moving towards an on-demand economy. Whether it’s on-demand movies or on-demand food, customers expect everything to be on-demand and instant. To keep up with such demands, applications must be able to serve information and process transactions at the same speed and accuracy as a professional barista crafting a perfect shot of espresso.</p>
<p>In such a high-speed scenario, where speed is paramount, traditional databases fall short of expectations. Their inherent latency and limited throughput can be a bottleneck.</p>

		<p>Developers at growing businesses face unique challenges, but building and scaling applications—whether it’s a cutting-edge AI app or a video streaming service—doesn’t have to be one of them. I’m excited to invite you to <strong>Deploy: Scaling With Simplicity</strong>, on January 22nd, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Deploy is DigitalOcean’s signature developer conference, now with an in-person option for more opportunities to connect and learn. Can’t join us in Austin? Don’t worry, Deploy is still available virtually as well—view the detailed agenda and register to join us today.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Developer platforms reduce developers’ cognitive load by abstracting away the various complexities of infrastructure and the development process, eventually improving their productivity and workflow. However, building a developer platform can be complex, and organizations could fail at it the first time. The primary reason is the lack of proper communication between the team building the platform and the team that will use it. Another reason for failing at platform engineering is not having clarity on what is important and what should be added to the platform. What are the elements necessary to build a helpful developer platform? And no, platform engineering is not only about tools or IDPs.</p>

		<p>DigitalOcean has been providing a managed Kubernetes service since 2019. Over those years, our infrastructure has changed a huge amount, notably in the form of a new and improved Containerised Control Plane (CCP) architecture launched in 2021. In this post, we’ll explore the journey we took to the new architecture using an open source project called Cluster API. This was combined with some DigitalOcean ‘’’scrappy magic’’’ to provide a scalable, fault tolerant, managed Kubernetes service for customers. We’ve written about it in the past, but it’s time to dive in and swim through the details.</p>
