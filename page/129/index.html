		<p>Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, agile, and fast. For managed service providers (MSPs) supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with cybersecurity services, staying ahead of these adversaries is crucial. One of the most effective ways to do so is through round-the-clock threat hunting.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll explore why constant threat hunting is essential, the challenges MSPs face in providing it, and how OpenText MDR can help overcome these challenges while offering SMBs the protection they need.</p>

		<p>The idea of artificial intelligence (AI) is not new, but recent advancements in related technologies have turned it from something more hypothetical-than-real to a tool that many of us use every day. The growing importance and proliferation of AI is at once exciting and potentially alarming as the foundations of many AI tools are essentially black boxes owned and controlled by a small number of powerful corporations.At Red Hat we believe that everyone should have the ability to contribute to AI. AI innovation shouldn&rsquo;t be restricted to companies that can afford massive amounts of processing po</p>

		<p><em>Am I Racist?</em>, Matt Walsh’s searing attack on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, dominated the documentary film box office in 2024. Screening in 1,600 theaters at its height, the film earned $12.3 million before streaming on the Daily Wire. Walsh’s film grossed more at the box office than any other documentary since 2019. That’s when Peter Jackson’s artistically boundary-pushing World War I film <em>They Shall Not Grow Old</em> brought in $12.2 million. </p>

		<p>Containers are an important part of modern computing, for hosting, for application development, and even as an alternative to virtualization. The infrastructure supporting containers has been refined and developed since the early days, so if you&rsquo;ve been holding off on adopting containers, you might be pleasantly surprised at how easy the daemonless Podman engine makes it to build, run, and manage containers and pods.Containers interface directly with Linux kernel abilities like cgroups and namespaces. Running a container literally uses your existing kernel to run additional Linux systems insid</p>

		<p>Companies are showing customers different prices for the same goods and services based what data they have on them, including details like their precise location or browser history.</p>
<p>The name for this method is surveillance pricing, and the FTC has just released initial findings of a report looking into that practice. In July 2024, the FTC requested information from eight companies offering surveillance pricing products and services that incorporate data about consumers’ characteristics and behavior.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In a troubling development for web publishers, numerous site owners are reporting dramatic drops in their Google AdSense earnings since early January 2025, with some seeing their monthly income plummet from comfortable four-figures to barely enough for a month&rsquo;s worth of instant noodles. This sudden downturn has left many content creators in crisis mode, particularly those relying on this income for student loan payments and basic living expenses.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-problem">The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>The impact appears to be widespread across various niches, but particularly noticeable in the technology and educational content sectors. One CS student&rsquo;s story particularly stands out: after five years of building a programming tutorial site from their freshman year study notes, their monthly AdSense revenue crashed from $1,500 to $218 – just days before their $890 student loan payment was due, on this discussion about google adsense revenue drop in the very beginning of this year.</p>
