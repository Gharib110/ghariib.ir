		<p>AWS Firewall Manager is a powerful tool that organizations can use to define common AWS WAF rules with centralized security policies. These policies specify which accounts and resources are in scope. Firewall Manager creates a web access control list (web ACL) that adheres to the organization’s policy requirements and associates it with the in-scope resources. Figure 1 shows a Firewall Manager security policy and web ACL created in each in-scope account.</p>

		<p>A detailed walkthrough demonstrates how attackers can manipulate Azure Key Vault’s access policies after compromising Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) credentials.</p>
<p>According to Faran Siddiqui, a penetration tester report, a “Key Vault 06 – Abuse Decryption Key,” shed light on this critical vulnerability and the technique involving AzureAD CLI and Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>The breakdown stems from “Key Vault 06 – Abuse Decryption Key,” a security lab scenario focused on helping red team testers and penetration testers understand potential threats in the Azure Key Vault ecosystem.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Can you imagine a modern working world without Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS) applications? Productivity, communication, and project management solutions have transformed the modern workplace, enabling hybrid and remote working, helping to cut costs, and offering unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Without them, the business world would grind to a halt. But these applications, like anything connected to the internet, are vulnerable to cyber threats. Part of the problem is that SaaS providers are responsible for securing SaaS infrastructure, platforms, and application&hellip;</p>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new malware campaign that leverages fake CAPTCHA verification checks to deliver the infamous Lumma information stealer.</p>
<p>“The campaign is global, with Netskope Threat Labs tracking victims targeted in Argentina, Colombia, the United States, the Philippines, and other countries around the world,” Leandro Fróes, senior threat research engineer at Netskope Threat Labs, said in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>
<p>“The campaign also spans multiple industries, including healthcare, banking, and marketing, with the telecom industry having the highest number of organizations targeted.”</p>

<p>I was fascinated by the idea of jet packs when I was a kid. They were sci-fi magic, and the idea that you could strap into an oversized backpack wrapped in tinfoil and fly around was very enticing. Better still was when I learned that these things weren’t powered by complicated rockets but by plain hydrogen peroxide, which violently decomposes into water and oxygen when it comes in contact with a metal like silver or platinum. Of course I ran right to the medicine cabinet to fetch a bottle of peroxide to drip on a spoon from my mother’s good silverware set. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed by the results.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump heads back to the White House, a University of Sussex professor who has been successfully predicting bitcoin (BTC) prices since 2021, is forecasting unprecedented highs which may breach $100k per token.</p>
<p>Prof Carol Alexander of the University of Sussex Business School says bitcoin’s rapid rise in the immediate wake of the US election is likely to continue before Trump’s inauguration on 20th January 2025. She also believes the lesser-known currencies ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE) will keep moving in the same direction, especially with the latter’s links to key Trump ally Elon Musk.</p>

		<p>AI has rapidly become integral to business operations and shows no signs of slowing down. In a recent Red Hat survey, more than three quarters of respondents said preparing for AI adoption was a top driver for their cloud growth in 2025. This rapid growth of interest and adoption of AI technologies brings challenges. That same research showed that 71% of IT managers said AI was one of the top skills gaps they will have over the next 12-18 months that will likely limit their cloud adoption ambitions.As we look to the year ahead and even beyond, we must consider how we address some of those unde</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity isn’t just about technology—it’s about people. That’s why Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnered with the BBC to explore the human side of cybersecurity in our latest article, <em>The Human Side of Cybersecurity: Building a Culture of Security</em>, available on the BBC website.</p>
<p>In the piece, we spotlight the AWS Security Guardians program and how it helps security enable your business, not slow it down. Through the program, teams are provided tools, resources, and guidance to help address security concerns at every step of development. This enables developers to make the right decisions and embed security deeper in their solutions. Using our approach with their Security Champions initiative, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia shared how the program has helped transform their company culture and give ownership of services and security directly to their teams.</p>
