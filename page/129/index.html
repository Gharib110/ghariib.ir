		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>DewTwo: a transparent PCS with quasi-linear prover, logarithmic verifier and 4.5KB proofs from falsifiable assumptions</strong><br>
<em>Benedikt Bünz, Tushar Mopuri, Alireza Shirzad, Sriram Sridhar</em></p>
<p>We construct the first polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) that has a transparent setup, quasi-linear prover time, $log N$ verifier time, and $log log N$ proof size, for multilinear polynomials of size $N$. Concretely, we have the smallest proof size amongst transparent PCS, with proof size less than $4.5$KB for $Nleq 2^{30}$. We prove that our scheme is secure entirely under falsifiable assumptions about groups of unknown order. The scheme significantly improves on the prior work of Dew (PKC 2023), which has super-cubic prover time and relies on the Generic Group Model (a non-falsifiable assumption). Along the way, we make several contributions that are of independent interest: PoKEMath, a protocol for efficiently proving that an arbitrary predicate over committed integer vectors holds; SIPA, a bulletproofs-style inner product argument in groups of unknown order; we also distill out what prior work required from the Generic Group Model and frame this as a falsifiable assumption.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Distributional Private Information Retrieval</strong><br>
<em>Ryan Lehmkuhl, Alexandra Henzinger, Henry Corrigan-Gibbs</em></p>
<p>A private-information-retrieval (PIR) scheme lets a client fetch a record from a remote database without revealing which record it fetched. Classic PIR schemes treat all database records the same but, in practice, some database records are much more popular (i.e., commonly fetched) than others. We introduce distributional private information retrieval, a new type of PIR that can run faster than classic PIR–both asymptotically and concretely–when the popularity distribution is heavily skewed. Distributional PIR provides exactly the same cryptographic privacy as classic PIR. The speedup comes from a relaxed form of correctness: distributional PIR guarantees that in-distribution queries succeed with good probability, while out-of-distribution queries succeed with lower probability.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> A well-crafted Dockerfile is crucial for creating efficient, secure, and reproducible container images. Following best practices ensures smaller image sizes, faster build times, and improved security. This article outlines key considerations for optimizing your Dockerfiles.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Before starting, ensure you have Docker installed and a basic understanding of Docker concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Optimized Dockerfiles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smaller Image Size:</strong> Reduced storage space and faster download times.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Build Times:</strong> Optimized layers lead to quicker image creation.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Security:</strong> Minimizing dependencies reduces potential vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Consistent builds across different environments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Poor Dockerfiles:</strong></p>

<p>With net zero and carbon reduction increasingly becoming a focal point for organisations, support through energy efficiency and sustainable transformation projects are crucial to the success of a carbon reduction plan. However, driving down energy consumption and rolling out energy projects is the responsibility of more than one department in an organisation. Many people – from engineers to investors and from management to staff – need to be brought together to make success happen.</p>

		<p>The European Union today imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence officers for their involvement in a series of cyberattacks targeting Estonian government agencies in 2020. </p>
<p>The individuals, identified as Nikolay Alexandrovich Korchagin, Vitaly Shevchenko, and Yuriy Fedorovich Denisov, are members of Russia’s General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU) Unit 29155. </p>
<p>This covert unit is notorious for its disrupting activities, including cyber espionage, sabotage, and crimes across Europe.</p>

<p>The attacks orchestrated by Unit 29155 breached the computer systems of several Estonian ministries, including Economic Affairs and Communications, Social Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. </p>

		<p>The pace of IT’s evolution is staggering—can you feel it? Just a few years ago, the focus was on decoupling monolithic legacy applications into microservices architectures. While that transformation remains important, today’s conversations have shifted to adopting large language models (LLMs) that unlock actionable insights and deliver competitive advantages across industries. The urgency is undeniable, and it’s pushing businesses to explore and implement AI as they strive to remain relevant. But here’s the critical question: Are you truly prepared to embrace AI, or are outdated prac</p>

		<p>A new cyberattack campaign, dubbed the “Fake DeepSeek Campaign,” has been discovered targeting macOS users. DeepSeek, a Chinese-developed AI chatbot, has rapidly gained popularity globally.</p>
<p>Threat Actors started exploiting its popularity to deliver malware &amp; infect users’ computers.</p>
<p>This campaign is designed to distribute the Poseidon Stealer, a sophisticated piece of malware to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised systems. </p>
<p>Security researchers with X handle @g0njxa have identified the campaign leveraging fake applications and malicious payloads to infiltrate macOS environments.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>FINAL bootstrap acceleration on FPGA using DSP-free constant-multiplier NTTs</strong><br>
<em>Jonas Bertels, Hilder V. L. Pereira, Ingrid Verbauwhede</em></p>
<p>This work showcases Quatorze-bis, a state-of-the-art Number Theoretic Transform circuit for TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs. It contains a novel modular multiplication design for modular multiplication with a constant for a constant modulus. This modular multiplication design does not require any DSP units or any dedicated multiplier unit, nor does it require extra logic whencompared to the state-of-the-art modular multipliers. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a constant multiplier Number Theoretic Transform design for TFHE-like schemes. Lastly, we use this Number Theoretic Transform design to implement a FINAL hardware accelerator for the AMD Alveo U55c which improves the Throughput metric of TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs by a factor 9.28x over Li et al.&rsquo;s NFP CHES 2024 accelerator and by 10-25% over the absolute state-of-the-art design FPT while using one third of FPTs DSPs.</p>
