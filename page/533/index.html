<p>Signal released <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/">end-to-end encrypted group calls</a> a year ago, and since then we’ve scaled from support for 5 participants all the way to 40. There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open source <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Calling-Service">Signal Calling Service</a> to do the job. This post will describe how it works in more detail.</p>

<p>Signal has no data to sell, no advertisers to sell it to, and no shareholders to benefit from such a sale. We’re building a different kind of tech – where your data stays in your hands – but we’re also building a different kind of tech <em>organization</em>. One without investors, quarterly earnings calls, or share price considerations. While the model for conventional tech companies incentivizes them to build products for <em>your data</em> rather than for <em>you</em>, Signal’s nonprofit structure is designed so that the only way value can accrue is in the experience of using the app; the only place it can accrue is in the hands of the people who use it.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of unsolicited and unwanted messaging dates back to the earliest communication platforms: from <a href="https://www.livescience.com/7028-ancient-cave-art-full-teenage-graffiti.html">prehistoric cave graffiti</a> and postal chain letters to popup ads and robocalls. To prevent spam, most online services rely on large-scale inspection of plaintext conversation content or detailed social-graph analysis to determine who is saying what to whom and whether or not that should be allowed. At Signal, we build on a foundation of privacy and do not have access to that type of data or metadata.</p>
