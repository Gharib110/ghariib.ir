	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-21610<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 45 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Trix is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get rich text editor for everyday writing. Versions prior to 2.1.12 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when pasting malicious code in the link field. An attacker could trick the user to copy&amp;paste a malicious `javascript:` URL as a link that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user&rsquo;s session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed. Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.12 or later to receive a patch. In addition to upgrading, affected users can disallow browsers that don&rsquo;t support a Content Security Policy (CSP) as a workaround for this and other cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Set CSP policies such as script-src &lsquo;self&rsquo; to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 5.3 | MEDIUM<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-22275<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 56 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> iTerm2 3.5.6 through 3.5.10 before 3.5.11 sometimes allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from terminal commands by reading the /tmp/framer.txt file. This can occur for certain it2ssh and SSH Integration configurations, during remote logins to hosts that have a common Python installation.<br>

		<p>How to guard against new threats in 2025: seven resolutions to boost cybersecurity</p>
<p>The outgoing 2024 brought a number of record-breaking data breaches — from the Taylor Swift concert ticket case, to the incident with 100 million Americans’ medical records. AI technology and cybercrime made leaps and bounds all year long. So how can you stay on top of all this to ensure personal information security? Here’s how: make these seven New Year resolutions — and stick to them throughout 2025.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As we look ahead to 2025, businesses across Asia Pacific (APAC) are expected to accelerate their adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity, using it as a critical tool to combat evolving AI-powered threats.</p>
<p>With 43% of security professionals predicting that these sophisticated threats will increasingly evade traditional detection methods, organizations are poised to leverage AI-driven strategies to proactively mitigate risks. At the same time, there is a growing push to secure AI systems themselves, evidenced by initiatives like Singapore’s recent AI security guidelines – trends that are likely to shape cybersecurity practices across the region in the coming year.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It may sound weird when I say that I would like to remember 2024 as the year of the biggest breaches. That’s mainly because that would mean we’ll never see another year like it.</p>
<p>To support this nomination, I will remind you of several high-profile breaches, some of a size almost beyond imagination, some that really left us worried because of the type of data that was stolen, and a few duds.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would prohibit data brokers from selling or transferring location and health data.</p>
<p>Data brokers have drawn attention this year by leaking several large databases, with the worst being the National Public Data leak. The data breach made international headlines because it affected hundreds of millions of people, and it included Social Security Numbers.</p>
<p>All this when data brokers had already been faced with reforms in the shape of the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA). Hwoever, APRA is not expected to pass before Congress wraps up for the year, and some lawmakers feel the need for extra data regulations.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Remediation has long been a sore spot in data security posture management (DSPM). Many of the currently available solutions are great at surfacing alerts but offer no real way for Security teams to take action without a separate effort to integrate with external remediation tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce a new and ready-to-use integration between Prisma Cloud DSPM and Cortex XSOAR. This latest development allows organizations to automatically remediate data security risks (or initiate relevant remediation workflows) and to easily incorporate data security risks, policies and classifications into new and existing remediation playbooks. For Palo Alto Networks, this represents another step toward our vision of further platformization in cloud security.</p>

<p>The DEF CON presentations are now live and available for your perusal on the DEF CON media server, free of all commercials, data capture or pesky algorithms. We suggest clearing some disk space and personal time this weekend to snatch up some of the many, many jewels our speakers dropped in Las Vegas. While you’re on media.defcon.org you can also find the slide decks, a ton of pictures and even the DC32 soundtrack. Enjoy, learn a few things and pass it on to someone who can use it.</p>
