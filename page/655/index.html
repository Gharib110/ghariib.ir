	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods <strong>one by one</strong>. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes.</p>
<p>Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a scheduling context element named <em>QueueingHint</em>. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Canonical is continuously hiring new talent. Being a remote- first company, Canonicalâ€™s new joiners receive a unique onboarding experience. In their first weeks, they are introduced to the different departments and the various tools they use to work asynchronously across the globe. New hires develop a good understanding of the open-source technologies that the company deploys and supports such as Openstack, Kubernetes, Kubeflow and OpenSearch â€“ in addition of course to Ubuntu, the worldâ€™s most famous OS, which they install on their laptops.Â </p>

<p>Generally, the projects featured on Hackaday actuallyÂ <em>do</em> something. We wonâ€™t go as far as to say they are practical creations, but they usually have some kind of function other than to sit there and blink. But what if just sitting still and blinking away randomly is precisely what you want a piece of hardware to do?</p>
<p>That was exactly the goal when [createscifi] set out to dress a Lite Brite up as a futuristic prop. On a technical level, this project is pretty much as simple as it gets. But we appreciated seeing some of the techniques brought to bear on this project, and perhaps more importantly, really like the channelâ€™s overall goal of creating affordable sci-fi props using common components. We donâ€™t plan on filming our own space epic anytime soonâ€¦but we like to know the option is there.</p>

		<p><em>Weâ€™re embarking on an expedition through the archives of Giant Swarmâ€™s blog.</em>Â </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dusting off our virtual time machines and donning our trusty Sherlock hats (aka looking at old links ðŸ˜€) to decode the mysteries hidden within our old blog posts. But hold on, this isn&rsquo;t a mere nostalgia trip; we&rsquo;re on a quest to uncover nuggets of wisdom and bring back some forgotten treasures. In a world that hurtles forward at lightning speed, it&rsquo;s all too easy to forget the paths we&rsquo;ve walked. As we wander down memory lane, we&rsquo;ll catch glimpses of our growth and witness the winds of change that have shaped our journey.Â </p>
