	<div>
		<p>During the forensic examination of a smartphone, we sometimes need to understand some basic settings of the device. Some simple examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of the device?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time zone automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data switched on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data roaming switched on or off?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Android devices, most of these settings are managed centrally by the Android settings provider. </p>

		<p>During the forensic analysis of a mobile device, we often have the need to understand the content of a specific file or folder. This is particularly true when a file or a folder is not parsed by our set of tools. </p>
<p>Our approach is, typically, to start googling the file or folder name to check if someone else has already done some researches on it. This approach is time consuming and it&rsquo;s not always easy to quickly find the proper reference. I also realized that I googled the same file/folder name multiple times&hellip;..</p>

<p>In the beginning of February, Apple may have received a secret order requiring the company to create an encryption backdoor. According to a leak, the UK government demanded blanket, covert access to all sorts of encrypted data globally. After that demand, Apple decided to disable Advanced Data Protection for iCloud in the UK, issuing an official statement. What does that mean for the law enforcement, and what consequences are expected for the end users?</p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries like healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and even autonomous vehicles—making our daily lives hyperconnected. But as more devices come online, relying solely on cloud computing can lead to slow response times, high bandwidth costs and security risks. The traditional cloud-based infrastructure struggles to keep up with the demands of real-time data processing, low latency, and proactive, preventative security. Before we dive in, let me explain what is edge computing is about and how it applies to IoT. Simply put, edge computing processes data right where it’s generated instead of routing it to remote […]</p>

<p>Upon loading the screen, we are presented with a file upload and a button to make a jpeg icon. We also note that the version string indicates it was made in 2016, with a version of <code>Version 2016.3717</code>. After playing around with it for a little while, I thought about how there was that ImageMagick bug last year that let you execute code remotely. I wasn’t sure it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>
