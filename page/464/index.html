<p>Generally, the projects featured on Hackaday actuallyÂ <em>do</em> something. We wonâ€™t go as far as to say they are practical creations, but they usually have some kind of function other than to sit there and blink. But what if just sitting still and blinking away randomly is precisely what you want a piece of hardware to do?</p>
<p>That was exactly the goal when [createscifi] set out to dress a Lite Brite up as a futuristic prop. On a technical level, this project is pretty much as simple as it gets. But we appreciated seeing some of the techniques brought to bear on this project, and perhaps more importantly, really like the channelâ€™s overall goal of creating affordable sci-fi props using common components. We donâ€™t plan on filming our own space epic anytime soonâ€¦but we like to know the option is there.</p>

		<p><em>Weâ€™re embarking on an expedition through the archives of Giant Swarmâ€™s blog.</em>Â </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dusting off our virtual time machines and donning our trusty Sherlock hats (aka looking at old links ðŸ˜€) to decode the mysteries hidden within our old blog posts. But hold on, this isn&rsquo;t a mere nostalgia trip; we&rsquo;re on a quest to uncover nuggets of wisdom and bring back some forgotten treasures. In a world that hurtles forward at lightning speed, it&rsquo;s all too easy to forget the paths we&rsquo;ve walked. As we wander down memory lane, we&rsquo;ll catch glimpses of our growth and witness the winds of change that have shaped our journey.Â </p>

		<p>So thereâ€™s been a fair bit of noise this past week about the Mac OS X Ransomware, the first of itsâ€™ kind called KeRanger. It also happens to be the first popular Mac malware of any form for some time. Itâ€™s also a lesson to all the Apple fanbois that their OS is not impervious [â€¦]</p>

		<p>Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV reports and custom user-defined lists, where trail can be anything from domain name (e.g. zvpprsensinaix.com for Banjori malware), URL (e.g. http://109.162.38.120/harsh02.exe for known malicious executable), IP address (e.g. 185.130.5.231 for [â€¦]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Aembit, the non-human IAM company, today announced the appointment of Mario Duarte as chief information security officer (CISO). Duarte, formerly head of security at Snowflake, joins Aembit with a deep commitment to address pressing gaps in non-human identity security.</p>
<p>Duarteâ€™s journey in cybersecurity began with a passion for penetration testing, sparked by the 1980s cult classic film WarGames. He started his career in red teaming, later expanding his expertise into both technical and leadership roles on the defensive side. Throughout his career, he has focused on protecting mission-critical systems, solving complex security problems, and developing and overseeing high-performing teams.</p>
