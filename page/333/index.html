		<p>At DigitalOcean, we’re dedicated to making cloud infrastructure easy and accessible to developers everywhere. In effort of this and to support our global community, we are thrilled to announce that DigitalOcean now accepts Alipay as a payment method for any and all DigitalOcean services and products. This addition will help to enable more customers, especially those in Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions, to conveniently pay for cloud computing services on our platform.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/digitalocean-vpc-peering-is-now-generally-available-ga-with-more-updates-to-enhance-the-networking-experience/">&lt;div&gt;DigitalOcean VPC Peering is Now Generally Available (GA), with More Updates to Enhance the Networking Experience&lt;/div&gt;</a></h1>
	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Peering is now generally available for all DigitalOcean customers. After our early access launch on October 16, we’ve enhanced VPC Peering with two major updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ability to create VPC-native DOKS clusters via the UI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to add Pod and service networks as trusted sources for databases</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-these-updates-will-benefit-your-networking-environment">How these updates will benefit your networking environment</h2>
<p><strong>VPC-native DOKS cluster creation via the UI</strong></p>
<p>By enabling direct VPC-native cluster creation, you gain more control over your networking configurations. DOKS clusters now inherit the security and isolation benefits of a designated VPC from the moment it’s created, eliminating the need for manual configuration, reducing complexity, and saving time.</p>

		<p><em>This blog post was originally published on The New Stack by Ninad Desai, Staff Site Reliability Engineer at InfraCloud.</em></p>
<p>Microservices have become the go-to approach for building scalable and resilient applications — mainly in the cloud native world. However, the increased complexity of managing communication between these distributed components has given rise to a powerful solution known as service mesh. As a dedicated infrastructure layer, a service mesh provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to streamline and secure interservice communication.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads continue to grow in complexity and scale, the need for powerful and efficient computational resources becomes more critical. Running workloads on Kubernetes allows you to leverage the scalability and self-healing capabilities, however, there are challenges when it comes to managing and optimizing GPU resources. This is where the GPU Operators and plugins step in. They provide a solution to deploy and manage GPUs in Kubernetes.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, a joint offering that brings together GitLab&rsquo;s comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform with Amazon Q&rsquo;s autonomous AI agents in a single, integrated solution.</p>
<p>GitLab Duo with Amazon Q transforms software development by integrating powerful AI agents directly into your daily workflows. Instead of switching between multiple tools, developers can now accelerate key tasks — from feature development to code reviews — all from within GitLab&rsquo;s comprehensive DevSecOps platform. Amazon Q’s AI agents act as intelligent assistants, automating time-consuming tasks like generating code from requirements, creating unit tests, conducting code reviews, and modernizing Java applications. By handling these complex tasks, this joint offering helps teams focus on innovation, while maintaining security and quality standards.</p>

		<p><strong>This message from Sid Sijbrandij and Bill Staples was shared with GitLab team members earlier today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sid:</strong> On today’s earnings call, I announced that I am stepping down as CEO and will remain Executive Chair of the Board. I also introduced GitLab’s new CEO, Bill Staples.</p>
<p>As a Board, we routinely do succession planning. This includes conversations with a number of top executives. We’ve been having these conversations in greater earnest since my cancer returned. Through these discussions, we identified someone uniquely qualified to lead GitLab. I want more time to focus on my cancer treatment and health. My treatments are going well, my cancer is not metastatic, and I&rsquo;m working towards making a full recovery. Stepping down from a role that I love is not easy, but I believe that it is the right decision for GitLab.</p>
