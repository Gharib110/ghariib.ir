<p>A sponge made of cotton and squid bone that has absorbed about 99.9% of microplastics in water samples in China could provide an elusive answer to ubiquitous microplastic pollution in water across the globe, a new report suggests.</p>
<p>[‚Ä¶]</p>
<p>The study tested the material in an irrigation ditch, a lake, seawater and a pond, where it removed up to 99.9% of plastic. It addressed 95%-98% of plastic after five cycles, which the authors say is remarkable reusability.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I was tasked with looking into improving the product documentation where I work. This isn&rsquo;t a huge task by itself, but often when you&rsquo;re at a startup you often have many things to juggle and different things to prioritise. While we <em>could</em> just randomly look through each documentation page and check, that would be hugely time-consuming. Additionally as documentation increases due to product functionality, we need to make sure that the docs are as high quality as possible.</p>

Google is teaming up with the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Meta, and Opera to form a new Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers group. Members of the group, managed by the Linux Foundation, will work together, pool resources, talent, time, and expertise to improve, innovate, and accelerate development of the open-source Chromium codebase. Why the Linux Foundation? Google cites their ‚Äúlong established practices for open governance, prioritizing transparency, inclusivity, and community-driven development.‚Äù For its part, Google says it has no intention of reducing its contributions to Chromium (which made up roughly 94 percent of all commits to the codebase in 2024), but will [‚Ä¶]</p>

		<p>I was recently brushing up on my Data Structures and Algorithms skills, specifically, sorting algorithms; and I found myself in an interesting situation.</p>
<p>How do I create a random array of length <code>n</code> of values to test my sorting algorithm? You might say that&rsquo;s easy, and it truly is. In your head you probably came up with something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>function randomArray(n) {
    const arrToReturn = [];

    for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        arrToReturn.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
    }
    return arrToReturn;
}
</code></pre><p>This definitely works as intended. But I was looking for something much simpler. Preferably a one-liner. Well, the first thought that came to mind was to use <code>new Array()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="meson-build-system">Meson build system</h2>
<p>For a long time, Git could be built using either a Makefile-based build system or an Autoconf-based build system. Git developers have been using mostly the Makefile-based build system, so the Autoconf-based build system has lagged behind in features and maintenance. Another issue was that a lot of Windows developers use integrated development environments (IDEs) that don‚Äôt have good support for Makefile- and Autoconf-based build systems.</p>
