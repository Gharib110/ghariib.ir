<p>I&rsquo;ve said it once, and I&rsquo;ll say it again: Raspberry Pis end up in all kinds of weird and wonderful projects. One moment, they&rsquo;re powering retro consoles; the next, they&rsquo;re attached to drones. If you want more proof that a Raspberry Pi can power just about anything DIY, this awesome jukebox uses the SBC as its beating heart to keep the old traditions alive.</p>

For those situations, tcpdump is a great ally.Take the course: Getting started with Linux fundamentalsTcpdump is a command-line utility that allows you to capture and analyze network traffic going through your system. It is often used to help troubleshoot network issues, as well as a security tool.A powerful and versatile tool that includes many options and filters, tcpdump can be used in a variety of cases. Because it&rsquo;s a command-line tool, it is ideal to run in remote servers or device</p>

<p>In the world of showing off, there is alongside ‘Does it play Doom?’ that other classic of ‘Does it play Bad Apple?’. Whereas either would be quaint in the context of the Vim editor, this didn’t deter [Nolen Royalty] from making Vim play the Bad Apple video. As this is a purely black and white video, this means that it’s possible to convert each frame into a collection of pixels, with regular expression based search and custom highlighting allowing each frame to be rendered in the Vim window.</p>

		<p>Theoretical BadRAM attack on virtualization systems exploits a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors.</p>
<p>Researchers from three European universities recently demonstrated the so-called BadRAM attack. This attack is made possible because of a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors, and primarily threatens cloud-solution providers and virtualization systems. In the worst-case scenario, the vulnerability could be used to compromise data from highly secure virtual machines.</p>
<p>However, implementing this scenario in practice would be quite difficult. The attack requires physical access to the server, plus the highest level of access to the software. Before discussing the BadRAM attack in detail, we should first understand the concept of a trusted execution environment (TEE).</p>

	<div>
		<p>Privacy is a hot topic at the moment - it continues to dominate the headlines as news of new NSA incursions, celebrity phone hacks, and corporate breaches are being reported on an increasingly regular basis. In response to this, a number of products have been brought to market that attempt to provide consumers with a greater level of privacy than typical devices allow for. In the phone market, one of the premier products to be released in recent years is undoubtedly the BlackPhone (<a href="http://www.blackphone.ch">http://www.blackphone.ch</a>), which has been cited numerous times in tech publications as being one of the best available defenses against mass surveillance, as it provides full end-to-end encryption facilities for voice calls and text/MMS messaging.</p>
