Today we’re adding one more feature into the mix: group links, which let you quickly create a link that anyone can follow to join your group. Like our other new group features, you can create a new group to try it out now, but these features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I created a simple python script for sandboxing Rust development using Docker. It’s called saferrust.

<p>A little over a year ago, I created a simple python script for sandboxing Rust development using Docker. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/mikecardwell/saferrust">saferrust</a>. You basically copy it into your PATH, name it “cargo” and pretend like you have the real cargo application installed. It pulls down the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/rust">latest offical Rust docker image from dockerhub</a>, mounts your CWD into it and then runs your cargo commands inside the docker container. I did this basically because I wanted to secure my homedir against potentially malicious packages on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> during development. If you want to know more about it, <a href="https://gitlab.com/mikecardwell/saferrust">check out the project on gitlab</a>.</p>
