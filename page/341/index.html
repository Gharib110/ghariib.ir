<p>AI is top of mind for security teams across every industry. As more organizations adopt generative AI and cloud-native technologies, IT teams confront more challenges with securing their high-performing cloud applications in the face of expanding attack surfaces. According to McKinsey’s State of AI in 2023 report, 40% of respondents said their organizations plan to increase their overall AI investment because of advancements in generative AI. But only 21% said their organizations have established policies governing employees’ use of generative AI technologies. Moreover, in addition to managing cloud spend and resource utilization, organizations must also now consider the cost and carbon impact of developing and using generative AI models.</p>

<p>As recent events have demonstrated, major software outages are an ever-present threat in our increasingly digital world. From business operations to personal communication, the reliance on software and cloud infrastructure is only increasing.</p>
<p>Outages can disrupt services, cause financial losses, and damage brand reputations. Understanding the causes of these outages is crucial for preventing them and ensuring smoother, more reliable tech operations. It’s also critical to have a strategy in place to address these outages, including both documented remediation processes and an observability platform to help you proactively identify and resolve issues to minimize customer and business impact.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>SPY-PMU: Side-Channel Profiling of Your Performance Monitoring Unit to Leak Remote User Activity</strong><br>
<em>Md Kawser Bepary, Arunabho Basu, Sajeed Mohammad, Rakibul Hassan, Farimah Farahmandi, Mark Tehranipoor</em></p>
<p>The Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU), a standard feature in all modern computing systems, presents significant security risks by leaking sensitive user activities through microarchitectural event data. This work demonstrates the feasibility of remote side-channel attacks leveraging PMU data, revealing vulnerabilities that compromise user privacy and enable covert surveillance without physical access to the target machine. By analyzing the PMU feature space, we create distinct micro-architectural fingerprints for benchmark applications, which are then utilized in machine learning (ML) models to detect the corresponding benchmarks. This approach allows us to build a pre-trained model for benchmark detection using the unique micro-architectural fingerprints derived from PMU data. Subsequently, when an attacker remotely accesses the victim’s PMU data, the pre-trained model enables the identification of applications used by the victim with high accuracy. In our proof-of-concept demonstration, the pre-trained model successfully identifies applications used by a victim when the attacker remotely accesses PMU data, showcasing the potential for malicious exploitation of PMU data. We analyze stress-ng benchmarks and build our classifiers using logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest ML models. Our proposed models achieve an average prediction accuracy of 98%, underscoring the potential risks associated with remote side-channel analysis using PMU data and emphasizing the need for more robust safeguards. This work underscores the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect against such vulnerabilities and provides a foundation for future research in micro-architectural security.</p>

<p>For less than the cost of a latte and in under 10 minutes, scammers today can create shockingly convincing deepfake videos of anyone: your mom, your boss, or even your child.</p>
<p>Imagine receiving a video call from your mom asking to borrow money for an emergency, or getting a voicemail from your boss requesting urgent access to company accounts. These scenarios might seem straightforward, but in 2025, they represent a growing threat: deepfake scams that can be created for just $5 in under 10 minutes. According to McAfee’s latest “State of the Scamiverse” report, deepfake scams have become an everyday reality. The average American now encounters 2.6 deepfake videos daily, with younger adults (18-24) seeing even more – about 3.5 per day. These aren’t just celebrity face-swaps or entertaining memes; they’re sophisticated scams designed to separate people from their money.</p>

		<p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the building blocks of modern applications and digital ecosystems. They enable applications to communicate seamlessly, power integrations, and drive innovation. However, as APIs become the backbone of interconnected systems, they also become high-value targets for cybercriminals. A single vulnerability can open the door to devastating breaches. This is why API security assessments are not just a best practice—they’re a business imperative.</p>
