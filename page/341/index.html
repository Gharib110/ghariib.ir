		<p>Since the dawn of Jenkins X 3 the default last step of reconciling the state of the files in your cluster repository to your cluster has been to execute <code>kubectl apply</code>. You can find more details about this here.</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks with <code>kubectl apply</code> though. The one that made me start looking for alternatives was that if you remove a resource from your cluster repository it may not be removed from your cluster. The way deletion works with <code>kubectl apply</code> is that it is handed the option <code>--prune</code> which will remove resources that are not in the manifests. Except that it doesn’t always work as expected. It will only remove certain kinds of resources defined in kubectl. In my case I removed an HorizontalPodAutoscaler from my cluster repository, but it wasn’t removed from my cluster.</p>

<p>If you don’t understand what is Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), please read this blog post first.</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-formats-comparison">Different SBOM formats comparison</h2>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U.S. defined minimum requirements for SBOM formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying the supplier of the software component.</li>
<li>Identifying the details about the version of the component.</li>
<li>Including unique identifiers for the component like cryptographic hash functions.</li>
<li>Including the relationships between all dependencies inside the component.</li>
<li>Including a timestamp of when and by whom the SBOM report was created or last modified</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we discuss different kinds and formats for SBOM standards and make a brief comparison between them. Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document.</p>

<p>Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-generation-tools-comparison">Different SBOM generation tools comparison</h2>
<p>If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At MWC 2023 Barcelona, <strong>Google Cloud</strong> announced that they can now run the <strong>radio access network (RAN)</strong> functions as software on Google Distributed Cloud Edge, providing communications service providers (CSPs- AKA telcos) with a common and agile operating model that extends from the core of the network to the edge, for a high degree of programmability, flexibility, and low operating expenses.  CSPs have already embraced open architecture, open-source software, disaggregation, automation, cloud, AI and machine learning, and new operational models, to name a few. The journey started in the last decade with Network Functions Virtualization, primarily with value added services and then deeper with core network applications, and in the past few years, that evolved into a push towards cloud-native. With significant progress in the core, the time for <strong>Cloud RAN</strong> is now, according to Google.  However, whether for industry or region-specific compliance reasons, data sovereignty needs, or latency or local data-processing requirements, most of the network functions deployed in a mobile or wireline network may have to follow a hybrid deployment model where network functions are placed flexibly in a combination of both on-premises and cloud regions. RAN, which is traditionally implemented with proprietary hardware, falls into that camp as well.</p>

<p>In 2025, <strong>cloud native security</strong> is set to undergo transformative progress. As Chief Information Security Officer at Aqua, I’ve seen how rapidly evolving threats and operational demands are driving organizations to redefine their approach to security. The focus is no longer just on adapting to challenges—it’s about deeply embedding security into every facet of development pipelines, runtime environments, and cloud ecosystems. </p>
