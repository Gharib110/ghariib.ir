		<p>Google has announced that container registry will be shut down some time after March 18, 2025. For GKE clusters created with version 1.12.0 or later of terraform-google-jx it‚Äôs unlikely that anything needs to be done, but for older clusters you should upgrade your cluster while considering our advice regarding migration from container registry to artifact registry.</p>
<p>If you are using a Google Service Account to run terraform you need to add the role requirement roles/artifactregistry.admin. See our guide regarding Google Service Account for details.</p>

		<p>We have put together some project ideas as part of our application to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2023 program.</p>
<h3 id="1-cd-events-integration-with-jenkins-x">1. CD events integration with Jenkins X</h3>
<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The cdEvents project standardises the way systems talk to each other, which enables Interoperability between systems so they speak a common language through the cdEvents spec in the event. Creating a capability in Jenkins X that can receive and sent a cdEvent would benefit the project and the DevOps ecosystem in general, by stopping glue code used to integrate systems and power innovation by letting end users swap out tools with no effort.</p>

		<p>We have put together a project proposal as part of our application to participate in the Google Season of Docs 2022 program.</p>
<h3 id="project-proposal">Project proposal</h3>
<h4 id="better-documentation-for-real-world-use-cases---jenkins-x">Better documentation for real world use cases - Jenkins X</h4>
<h5 id="about-us">About us</h5>
<p>Jenkins X provides automated CI/CD for Kubernetes with Preview Environments on Pull Requests using Cloud Native pipelines from Tekton.</p>
<h5 id="problem">Problem</h5>
<ul>
<li>End users of Jenkins X are unable to find information on how to use Jenkins X for real world use cases which includes:
<ul>
<li>Production best practices</li>
<li>Scanning images in Jenkins X pipelines</li>
<li>How to make your app use different configuration/secrets for each environment</li>
<li>Observability for your apps, logging, metrics, tracing</li>
<li>Tests (Integration, e2e)</li>
<li>Artifact management</li>
<li>Multi cluster</li>
<li>Integration with other tools in the cloud native sector</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="project-scope">Project scope</h5>
<ul>
<li>Audit the current Jenkins X documentation and create a friction log</li>
<li>Use the friction log as a guide for understanding the gaps in the documentation</li>
<li>Interact with the Jenkins X community to create a list of top use cases
<ul>
<li>Create a survey</li>
<li>Look at the github issues and slack messages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work with the volunteers to incorporate those changes into the documentation</li>
<li>Establish a feedback loop (the target customers are the end users of Jenkins X) to improve the documentation</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="measuring-project-success">Measuring project success</h5>
<ul>
<li>Decrease in the number of github issues raised by end users on documentation related to common real world use cases</li>
<li>Short 1-2 minute videos on common tasks that end users of Jenkins X would like to perform.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="recommended-skills">Recommended skills</h5>
<ul>
<li>Must have:
<ul>
<li>Experience with github</li>
<li>Communication skills to work with the Jenkins X community</li>
<li>Creating online surveys</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nice to have:
<ul>
<li>Basic experience with docker compose (local development scripts use compose)</li>
<li>Good video editing skills.</li>
<li>Some knowledge working with the documentation of other tools in the kubernetes ecosystem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="mentorsvolunteers">Mentors/Volunteers</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ankit D Mohapatra</li>
<li>Christoffer Vig</li>
<li>M√•rten Svantesson</li>
<li>Tom Hobson</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>The project will take roughly 6 months to complete. Once the technical writer is selected, we will do an orientation to bring him up to speed. This is the timeline we have in mind, but we are flexible.</p>

		<p>Since the dawn of Jenkins X 3 the default last step of reconciling the state of the files in your cluster repository to your cluster has been to execute <code>kubectl apply</code>. You can find more details about this here.</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks with <code>kubectl apply</code> though. The one that made me start looking for alternatives was that if you remove a resource from your cluster repository it may not be removed from your cluster. The way deletion works with <code>kubectl apply</code> is that it is handed the option <code>--prune</code> which will remove resources that are not in the manifests. Except that it doesn‚Äôt always work as expected. It will only remove certain kinds of resources defined in kubectl. In my case I removed an HorizontalPodAutoscaler from my cluster repository, but it wasn‚Äôt removed from my cluster.</p>

		<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>If you don‚Äôt understand what is Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), please read this blog post first.</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-formats-comparison">Different SBOM formats comparison</h2>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U.S. defined minimum requirements for SBOM formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying the supplier of the software component.</li>
<li>Identifying the details about the version of the component.</li>
<li>Including unique identifiers for the component like cryptographic hash functions.</li>
<li>Including the relationships between all dependencies inside the component.</li>
<li>Including a timestamp of when and by whom the SBOM report was created or last modified</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we discuss different kinds and formats for SBOM standards and make a brief comparison between them. Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document.</p>

<p>Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-generation-tools-comparison">Different SBOM generation tools comparison</h2>
<p>If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you‚Äôre following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization.</p>
