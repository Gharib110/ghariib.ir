<p>Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 today released its 2025 Global Incident Response Report, revealing that 86% of major cyber incidents in 2024 resulted in operational downtime, reputational damage or financial loss. The report (based on 500 major cyber incidents that Unit 42 responded to across 38 countries and every major industry) highlights a new trend: financially motivated attackers have shifted their focus to deliberate operational disruption, prioritizing sabotage – destroying systems, locking customers out and causing prolonged downtime – to maximize impact and pressure organizations into paying extortion demands.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Email providers are rushing to implement artificial intelligence writing assistants, from Gemini AI, Mailmeteor, to Microsoft Copilot – now there are many AI email writers to choose from. But before you go ahead and start using AI in your mailbox, you should be aware of how they threaten your email privacy. After learning about what it really means to use AI email writers, you will most likely think twice about granting certain AI tools access to your private mailbox. In this guide, we take a look at five AI email writers, and which – if any – you mustn’t use.</p>

		<p>The European Union’s Network and Information Systems Directive 2 (NIS2) is now in effect. And, throughout 2025, governments across the continent will be transposing it into national law. Complying with the regulation involves a combination of changes to workflows, employee behavior, and technology. There isn’t a single ‘turnkey’ solution that will make you compliant on […]</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Ultrawide monitors have been around for a while now, but they still have compatibility issues to live with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an ultrawide monitor convert ever since the Nixeus EDG 34 landed on my desk for review around the end of 2019. I love the additional space for productivity and the immersiveness of games, but I&rsquo;d be lying if I said it was all smooth sailing. The 21:9 aspect ratio has been around since LG launched the EA93 Series in 2012, but even the best ultrawide monitors still suffer from a common core of annoyances. To be fair, none of them are dealbreakers, and I&rsquo;ll happily live with them for the extra real estate to put two browser windows side-by-side, but it&rsquo;s worth knowing what you&rsquo;re getting into when you decide to go for an ultrawide monitor.</p>

		<p>Try these ideas to reduce eye strain while using your computer.</p>
<p>Using a screen for extended durations is practically necessary for work and recreation. It usually takes a toll on your health and, most importantly, leads to eye strain and the associated discomfort of irritation, headaches, and dry eyes. While Windows 11 already has specific features to help reduce strain, you can take a few simple steps irrespective of the device you spend time staring at.</p>

	<div>
		<p>These are the best sculpting software you should be using with your 3D printer.</p>
<p>If you want to create highly detailed or organic 3D models, 3D sculpting is the best technique. Unlike other 3D design methods that rely on manipulating vertices, edges, and faces to shape the objects, sculpting allows for a more intuitive, brush-based approach, making it easier to achieve smooth, natural shapes and intricate details. This is why it’s the most recommended method of creating characters, figurines, jewelry designs, and organic objects like trees and rocks. You can use sculpting brushes and tools to manipulate the design through pushing, pulling, pinching, moving, and smoothing until you achieve the intended design.</p>

	<div>
		<p>6G could be available by the end of the decade, which should decrease latency and connectivity speeds for users. However, these wireless networks present new cybersecurity challenges. What should industry professionals prepare for? What Is 6G? 6G will be the sixth generation of wireless technology once it arrives. Experts say it could debut by 2030, though companies started 5G-Advanced integration in 2024. Terahertz (THz) frequencies will be a key part of 6G, as it can quickly transmit data and reduce latency. This band is more powerful because it incorporates unused frequency bands&hellip;</p>
