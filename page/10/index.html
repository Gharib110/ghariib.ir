<p>A new ransomware operator named ‘Mora_001’ is exploiting two Fortinet vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to firewall appliances and deploy a custom ransomware strain dubbed SuperBlack.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities, both authentication bypasses, are CVE-2024–55591 and CVE-2025–24472, which Fortinet disclosed in January and February, respectively.</p>
<p>When Fortinet first disclosed CVE-2024–55591 on January 14, they confirmed it had been exploited as a zero-day, with Arctic Wolf stating it had been used in attacks since November 2024 to breach FortiGate firewalls.</p>

<p>But sabi pipo no dey optimistic again say dem go fit recover di rest of di money becos of di North Korean knowledge for hacking and laundering of di money.</p>
<p>Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point tok say, “North Korea na veri closed system and closed economy so dem don create successful industry of hacking and laundering and dem no care about di negative impression of cyber crime”</p>

<p>Law enforcement and digital forensic specialists have long utilized GPUs for password recovery. GPUs excel at this task due to their thousands of parallel processing cores, enabling rapid hash computations. Tools like Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery leverage GPU acceleration to significantly outperform traditional CPUs in brute-force attacks. The new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture doubles the number of INT32 compute units compared to Ada and Ampere. How will this architectural change affect password recovery, and is it worth upgrading to a new GPU?</p>

<p>Just a week ago, we published an article about NVIDIA’s new generation of Blackwell-based graphics cards. Despite a noticeable price hike, performance gains in this generation are minimal, with one notable exception: the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 significantly outperforms its predecessor in all key aspects. However, this GPU has also revealed a potential issue that could make its use in workstations running 24/7 problematic and potentially unsafe.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-connector">The New Connector</h2>
<p>Before diving into the root of the issue, let’s first understand how it arose. Modern GPUs require far more power than what can be delivered through the PCIe slot alone, forcing manufacturers to provide additional power via cables directly from the PSU. Antec, a well-known PSU manufacturer, has published a diagram illustrating the number of cables required to power high-performance graphics cards.</p>
