		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>New Quantum Cryptanalysis of Binary Elliptic Curves (Extended Version)</strong><br>
<em>Kyungbae Jang, Vikas Srivastava, Anubhab Baksi, Santanu Sarkar, Hwajeong Seo</em></p>
<p>This paper improves upon the quantum circuits required for the Shor&rsquo;s attack on binary elliptic curves. We present two types of quantum point addition, taking both qubit count and circuit depth into consideration.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose an in-place point addition that improves upon the work of Banegas et al. from CHES'21, reducing the qubit count – depth product by more than $73%$ – $81%$ depending on the variant. Furthermore, we develop an out-of-place point addition by using additional qubits. This method achieves the lowest circuit depth and offers an improvement of over $92%$ in the qubit count – quantum depth product (for a single step).</p>

<p>At this point, many of us have gone all-in on USB-C. It’s gotten to the point that when you occasionally run across a gadget that <em>doesn’t</em> support being powered USB-C, the whole experience seems somewhat ridiculous. If 90% of your devices using the same power supply, that last 10% starts feeling very antiquated.</p>
<p>So why should your breadboard be any different? [Axiometa] has recently unveiled a simple PCB that will plug into a standard solderless breadboard to provide 3.3 and 5 VDC when connected to a USB-C power supply. The device is going to start a crowdfunding campaign soon if you want to buy a completed one — but with the design files and Bill of Materials already up on GitHub, nothing stops you from spinning up your own version today.</p>

		<p>Starting March 3, 2025, we will no longer accept new registrations of Azure DevOps OAuth apps. This is the first step we’ll be taking towards our longer-term vision of sunsetting the Azure DevOps OAuth platform. Moving forward, we’ll be publicly advocating all developers that are building applications on top of Azure DevOps REST APIs to explore the Microsoft Identity platform and registering a new Entra application instead.</p>
<p>All existing Azure DevOps OAuth apps will continue working until the official end-of-life date, which we will announce in 2025. In the interim, we offer continued support to all current Azure DevOps OAuth app developers.</p>

<p>The modern-day cyber threat landscape is marked by the rise in malware variants that give attackers the green light to gain complete remote control over targeted systems, such as a nefarious Remcos RAT spread via a phishing attack vector. At the turn of January 2025, defenders unveiled an emerging stealthy malware dubbed NonEuclid RAT, which is enriched with sophisticated offensive capabilities, like advanced detection evasion techniques, privilege escalation, and ransomware encryption.</p>

<p>Today, development teams suffer from a lack of automation for time-consuming tasks, the absence of standardization due to an overabundance of tool options, and insufficiently mature DevSecOps processes. This leads to frustrating bottlenecks for developers attempting to build and deliver software. For multinational enterprises, the cost of all that toil, complexity, and frustration multiplies exponentially due to the size of those organizations. In such contexts, platform engineering offers a compelling solution to enable business competitiveness in a manner that significantly enhances the developer experience. A central element of platform engineering teams is a robust Internal Developer Platform (IDP), which encompasses a set of tools, services, and infrastructure that enables developers to build, test, and deploy software applications.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the Independence Assumption in Quasi-Cyclic Code-Based Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Maxime Bombar, Nicolas Resch, Emiel Wiedijk</em></p>
<p>Cryptography based on the presumed hardness of decoding codes &ndash; i.e., code-based cryptography &ndash; has recently seen increased interest due to its plausible security against quantum attackers. Notably, of the four proposals for the NIST post-quantum standardization process that were advanced to their fourth round for further review, two were code-based. The most efficient proposals &ndash; including HQC and BIKE, the NIST submissions alluded to above &ndash; in fact rely on the presumed hardness of decoding structured codes. Of particular relevance to our work, HQC is based on quasi-cyclic codes, which are codes generated by matrices consisting of two cyclic blocks.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Managing compliance across a sprawling cloud environment can be overwhelming. This is where <strong>AWS Config Conformance Packs</strong> shine. These are pre-packaged sets of AWS Config rules and remediation actions designed to help you meet specific compliance frameworks or organizational standards with minimal effort.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-conformance-packs">What Are Conformance Packs?</h3>
<p>Conformance Packs simplify compliance management by bundling AWS Config rules into reusable templates. These templates can be applied across multiple accounts and regions, ensuring consistent governance and compliance.</p>
