		<p>The more devices, digital apps and online accounts you use, the more efficient and convenient your life becomes. But all that ease of use comes with a price. Your devices are constantly collecting your personal data to fine-tune your user experience. At the same time, hackers, and other cyber criminals are working round the clock to steal this sensitive information.</p>
<p>Think of your digital identity as a confidential file full of high-value information – passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, social security numbers and more. If you’re not taking the proper steps to guard your online privacy, you could end up handing over the files to a vast army of cybercriminals.</p>

		<p>A Deep Dive into Network Address Management: Private IPs, RFC1918, NAT, and VPN Security Essentials.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-private-ip-addresses">Understanding Private IP Addresses</h2>
<p>Private IP addresses are special network identifiers used within closed networks, acting as unique labels for devices that don&rsquo;t need direct internet access. These addresses operate exclusively within local networks, creating a secure environment for internal communication.</p>
<p>Think of private IP addresses as internal phone extensions in an office building. Just as these extensions work only within the building, private IP addresses function solely within your network. The outside world can&rsquo;t directly reach these addresses, adding a natural layer of security.</p>

		<p>Data is not just a strategic asset. It’s the lifeblood of your organization. Losing access to any strategic asset can threaten an organization’s viability; without plants and equipment, manufacturers would find it difficult to succeed, and service providers can’t operate without brand recognition. Similarly, without data, your organization could be left in a state of complete and utter paralysis, unable to function or recover. </p>
<p>Like the security of other strategic assets, data loss prevention is not a reactive measure but a critical function that organizations must proactively address. By taking the initiative and implementing effective data loss prevention strategies, you can assert control over your data’s security and ensure the continuity of your operations.</p>

		<p><em>Areg Danagoulian, associate professor in the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, has built a career around nuclear detection technology. His work has focused, among other things, on a system that could greatly improve the current process for verifying compliance of nuclear warheads.</em></p>
<p><em>Earlier this year, he published new work on physical cryptographic nuclear warhead verification and on active detection of shielded nuclear materials in journals including</em> Nature Communications <em>and the</em> Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. <em>He has also received a pair of prestigious accolades: a radiation science and technology award from the American Nuclear Society and the honor of being named, along with his team, as the 2019 Arms Control Association (ACA) Arms Control Persons of the Year.</em> <em>“This innovation paves the way for more effective arms control agreements, inspections, and enforcement,&quot; said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the ACA. &ldquo;Professor Danagoulian’s MIT team has brought the best science to arms control and provided a creative solution that can reduce nuclear threats and enhance security.”</em></p>

		<p><em>Ron Rivest is an MIT Institute Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He’s an authority on algorithms and an inventor of the RSA public-key cryptosystem, one of the most widely used algorithms to securely transmit data. Since the 1980s, he’s taught students how to use cryptography to help secure voting systems. Then, in 2000, an historic recount in Florida determined the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, and the Caltech / MIT Voting Technology Project was founded with the mission to secure future elections, pulling in Rivest, who has been involved since, as well as other MIT faculty from the Department of Political Science and the MIT Sloan School of Management.</em></p>

		<p>Dolby Vision offers various technological advantages over other HDR formats, and is the one best positioned for future displays.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new smart TV or projector, you&rsquo;ll be parsing through a mountain of specs and terms that you may not be all that familiar with. Among them is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and its various standards. Two of the most common formats you&rsquo;ll see listed are Dolby Vision and HDR10.</p>

		<p>You might want to ride this year out if you don&rsquo;t need an immediate upgrade.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is almost here, and we&rsquo;re expecting Nvidia to unveil the RTX 5000 series, AMD to show us what the next generation of Radeon GPUs will be called, and a bunch of other PC hardware that&rsquo;ll be ripe for upgrading to this year. It should be a wonderful time with the future of PC gaming on display with everything consumers will be able to buy later on in stores. But this year isn&rsquo;t normal, and really, no technology release for a while has.</p>

		<p>The costs associated with insider threats continued to rise in 2022. </p>
<p>This is bad news for organizations that are already under financial pressure from the uncertainty of the economy. As interest rates continue to climb and customers become more conservative about how they spend, the last thing that any organization needs is to be putting out fires from security incidents coming from arsonists inside their own house.  </p>
<p>And yet, a variety of factors, not the least of which are sizable layoffs hitting companies and the fluidity of access to data, make the possibility of an insider threat increasingly likely. </p>
