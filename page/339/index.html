		<p><em>Ron Rivest is an MIT Institute Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He’s an authority on algorithms and an inventor of the RSA public-key cryptosystem, one of the most widely used algorithms to securely transmit data. Since the 1980s, he’s taught students how to use cryptography to help secure voting systems. Then, in 2000, an historic recount in Florida determined the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, and the Caltech / MIT Voting Technology Project was founded with the mission to secure future elections, pulling in Rivest, who has been involved since, as well as other MIT faculty from the Department of Political Science and the MIT Sloan School of Management.</em></p>

	<div>
		<p>Dolby Vision offers various technological advantages over other HDR formats, and is the one best positioned for future displays.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new smart TV or projector, you&rsquo;ll be parsing through a mountain of specs and terms that you may not be all that familiar with. Among them is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and its various standards. Two of the most common formats you&rsquo;ll see listed are Dolby Vision and HDR10.</p>

		<p>You might want to ride this year out if you don&rsquo;t need an immediate upgrade.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is almost here, and we&rsquo;re expecting Nvidia to unveil the RTX 5000 series, AMD to show us what the next generation of Radeon GPUs will be called, and a bunch of other PC hardware that&rsquo;ll be ripe for upgrading to this year. It should be a wonderful time with the future of PC gaming on display with everything consumers will be able to buy later on in stores. But this year isn&rsquo;t normal, and really, no technology release for a while has.</p>

		<p>The costs associated with insider threats continued to rise in 2022. </p>
<p>This is bad news for organizations that are already under financial pressure from the uncertainty of the economy. As interest rates continue to climb and customers become more conservative about how they spend, the last thing that any organization needs is to be putting out fires from security incidents coming from arsonists inside their own house.  </p>
<p>And yet, a variety of factors, not the least of which are sizable layoffs hitting companies and the fluidity of access to data, make the possibility of an insider threat increasingly likely. </p>

		<p>In today’s digital-first world, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face cybersecurity challenges that grow more complex by the day. SMBs are prime targets for attackers hoping to gain a foothold inside any organization that doesn’t have extensive security measures. As threats increase, so does the need for comprehensive, reliable, and accessible protection.</p>
<p>This is where managed detection and response (MDR) services come in. MDR combines threat detection, investigation, and response, offering businesses the support from a team of security experts who monitor the environment 24/7 to identify and respond to threats. For many SMBs, MDR is an ideal solution because it provides a level of protection and expertise that would otherwise require building an in-house security operations center (SOC).</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t toss those old USB drives, they can still be pretty useful!</p>
<p>Ever since floppy disks were phased out, zip drives went the way of the dinosaurs, and file sizes increased to the point that CDs weren&rsquo;t big enough to pass them along, the humble USB drive has been the portable storage medium of choice. Chances are you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of them in your desk drawer—ones you bought, ones you were given, and ones that came with hardware with the relevant driver files on them.</p>
