<p>As a platform engineer at a mid-size startup, I’m responsible for identifying bottlenecks and developing solutions to streamline engineering operations to keep up with the velocity and scale of the engineering organization. In this post, I outline some of the challenges we faced with one of our clients, how we addressed them, and provide guides on how to tackle these challenges at your company.</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity is no longer optional—especially for companies in the automotive industry managing sensitive data. The <strong>Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX)</strong> provides a structured approach for organizations to standardize their security measures, ensuring compliance with industry expectations while mitigating the risks of breaches and data leaks.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>For businesses looking to achieve <strong>TISAX certification</strong>, preparation is key. The process involves multiple levels of assessment and strict security requirements that align with ISO 27001 but extend to industry-specific concerns, such as prototype protection and data privacy.</p>

		<p><em>Prisma Cloud helps federal agencies and public sector partners achieve the most stringent security standards, as the world’s only cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) to achieve FedRAMP High Authorization on the</em> <em>FedRAMP Marketplace</em>_._</p>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government initiative that standardizes the assessment, authorization and monitoring of cloud services for security. With the goal of promoting use of secure cloud services across the government, FedRAMP helps reduce costs and duplicative efforts, encourage public-private partnerships for innovation and enhanced security, and accelerate the adoption of cloud computing within federal agencies.</p>

<p>I like to start long blog posts with a tl;dr, so here it is:</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve ingested a corpus of 1.5TB worth of stealer logs known as &ldquo;ALIEN TXTBASE&rdquo; into Have I Been Pwned. They contain 23 billion rows with 493 million unique website and email address pairs, affecting 284M unique email addresses. We&rsquo;ve also added 244M passwords we&rsquo;ve never seen before to Pwned Passwords and updated the counts against another 199M that were already in there. Finally, we now have a way for domain owners to query their entire domain for stealer logs and for website operators to identify customers who have had their email addresses snared when entering them into the site. (Note: stealer logs are still freely and easily searchable by individuals, scroll to the bottom for a walkthrough.)</strong></p>
