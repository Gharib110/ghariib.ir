<p>Back in November we first brought you word of a slicing technique by which the final strength of 3D printed parts could be considerably improved by adjusting the first layer height of each wall so that subsequent layers would interlock like bricks. It was relatively easy to implement, didn‚Äôt require anything special on the printer to accomplish, and testing showed it was effective enough to pursue further. Unfortunately, there was some patent concerns, and it seemed like nobody wanted to be the first to step up and actually implement the feature.</p>

<p>The Spanish National Cryptologic Center (CCN) has published a new STIC guide (CCN-STIC-887 Anexo A) that provides a comprehensive template and supporting artifacts for implementing landing zones that comply with Spain‚Äôs National Security Framework (ENS) Royal Decree 311/2022 using the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS. Spain‚Äôs ENS establishes a common framework of basic principles and requirements of security for Spanish public sector organizations and their service providers, including supply chain providers. Over the years, the collaboration between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the CCN has resulted in the publication of eight secure configuration guides (Series STIC 887) that provide comprehensive advice on the configuration of AWS services to align with the ENS. The guide CCN-STIC-887 Anexo A is the last addition to this series.</p>
