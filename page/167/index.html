	<b><time>16.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hey there, fellow engineers and tech enthusiasts! I’m excited to share one of my favorite strategies for modern software delivery: combining Docker and Jenkins to power up your CI/CD pipelines. </p>
<p>Throughout my career as a Senior DevOps Engineer and Docker Captain, I’ve found that these two tools can drastically streamline releases, reduce environment-related headaches, and give teams the confidence they need to ship faster.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll walk you through what Docker and Jenkins are, why they pair perfectly, and how you can build and maintain efficient pipelines. My goal is to help you feel right at home when automating your workflows. Let’s dive in.</p>

		<p>Without continuous improvement in software security, you’re not standing still — you’re walking backward into oncoming traffic. Attack vectors multiply, evolve, and look for the weakest link in your software supply chain daily. </p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures forecasts that the global cost of software supply chain attacks will reach nearly $138 billion by 2031, up from $60 billion in 2025 and $46 billion in 2023. A single overlooked vulnerability isn’t just a flaw; it’s an open invitation for compromise, potentially threatening your entire system. The cost of a breach doesn’t stop with your software — it extends to your reputation and customer trust, which are far harder to rebuild. </p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-55924<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 14, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 53 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically, this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, state-changing actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend, which can occur under the following conditions: The user opens a malicious link, such as one sent via email. The user visits a compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer` feature is disabled, 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to lax or none. The vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Scheduler Module” allows attackers to trigger pre-defined command classes - which can lead to unauthorized import or export of data in the worst case. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42 ELTS which fixes the problem described. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.0 | HIGH<br>

<p>syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]</p>

<p>Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().</p>

<strong>Description :</strong> The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions 2.2.85 to 2.3.3. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what user meta can be updated during profile registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register on the site as an administrator.<br>

These are specifically * unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or * IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6 * header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers * are not supported with this feature. This feature * cannot be set in features for a device with * NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being * DEPRECATED (see below).</p>

A new stable release of Flatpak is out with a wealth of improvements in tow. Flatpak 1.16.0 is the first stable release in the new 1.16.x series, coming more than two years after the Flatpak 1.14.x cycle began and containing features, fixes, and other work undertaken from the 1.15.x development releases. Such as? Well, the way that Flatpak apps access USB devices is improved in Flatpak 1.16.x thanks to a new input device permission.
