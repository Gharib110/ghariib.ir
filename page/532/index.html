<p>Here is a very quick announcement for users of the Kali Linux Docker Images. Until recently we used to have a Docker image named simply kali, and it was built from the last versioned release of Kali (e.g. 2019.4, 2020.1, etc.) matching our “kali-last-snapshot” network repositories branch. In a way, this</p>

<p>It’s a new year, and I’ve decided it’s a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal.</p>
<p>I have now been working on Signal for almost a decade. It has always been my goal for Signal to grow and sustain beyond my involvement, but four years ago that would still not have been possible. I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone. I couldn’t ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation.</p>

<p>Signal released <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/">end-to-end encrypted group calls</a> a year ago, and since then we’ve scaled from support for 5 participants all the way to 40. There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open source <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Calling-Service">Signal Calling Service</a> to do the job. This post will describe how it works in more detail.</p>

<p>Signal has no data to sell, no advertisers to sell it to, and no shareholders to benefit from such a sale. We’re building a different kind of tech – where your data stays in your hands – but we’re also building a different kind of tech <em>organization</em>. One without investors, quarterly earnings calls, or share price considerations. While the model for conventional tech companies incentivizes them to build products for <em>your data</em> rather than for <em>you</em>, Signal’s nonprofit structure is designed so that the only way value can accrue is in the experience of using the app; the only place it can accrue is in the hands of the people who use it.</p>
