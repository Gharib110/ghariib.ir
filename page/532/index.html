<p>Now that our 2019.2 release is out, we thought we would take this opportunity to cover some of the changes and new features we have coming to Kali Linux in the following year. Normally, we only really announce things when they are ready to go public, but a number of these changes are going to impact users pretty extensively so we wanted to share them early.</p>

<p>Kali Linux has had support for WSL for <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">some time</a>, but its usefulness has been somewhat limited. This was mostly due to restrictions placed on some system calls , most importantly those revolving <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1349">around networking</a>. Furthermore, additional issues with speed, specifically I/O, were also problematic. Because of this, Kali WSL has mostly been relegated to reporting functions after an assessment is completed. A cool technology, and certainly an amazing engineering feat, but as is, it just was not that useful in the field.</p>

<p>Like many others, we have been following the latest developments in Australia related to the “Assistance and Access” bill with a growing sense of frustration. The widespread adoption of strong cryptography and end-to-end encryption has given people around the world the ability to protect their personal information and communicate securely. Life is increasingly lived online, and the everyday actions of billions of people depend on this foundation remaining strong.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-1,256/">Raven</a> is another boot2root challenge currently available for download at <a href="https://vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a>. One of the cool things about Raven is it’s actually kind of realistic and a fairly easy challenge, which makes it a great boot2root for learning how to hack. I had been wanting to do a sort of tutorial for beginners for a while now, and I think Raven is a good challenge to do this writeup on. So unlike my previous writeups where I just mention the tools or techniques I use to escalate to root privileges, I’ll spend more time in this one talking about my thought processes, and my failures. Just in case anyone thinks it takes me 5 minutes to solve these challenges, it doesn’t. There’s a lot of swearing, and red herrings along the way.</p>
