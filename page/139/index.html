		<p>Continuous deployment is a game-changing practice that enables teams to deliver value faster, with higher confidence. However, diving into advanced deployment workflows — such as GitOps, container orchestration with Kubernetes, or dynamic environments — can be intimidating for teams just starting out.</p>
<p>At GitLab, we&rsquo;re committed to making delivery seamless and scalable. By enabling teams to focus on the fundamentals, we empower them to build a strong foundation that supports growth into more complex strategies over time. This guide provides essential steps to begin implementing continuous deployment with GitLab, laying the foundation for your long-term success.</p>

<p>Knowing how to import your projects to GitLab is an essential skill to make the most of the GitLab DevSecOps platform. You’ve set up your account, invited users, and organized them based on your use case or team structure. Now, you need to bring your existing projects into GitLab and start collaborating. These projects can be local files on your computer or hosted on a different source code management platform. Let&rsquo;s explore the options.</p>

		<p>A newly discovered VPN backdoor uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that&hellip;</p>

		<p>The pretty lights mean you&rsquo;re torturing your processor.</p>
<p>If you want to keep tabs on your Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s CPU usage, you can always use the built-in tools on your OS or download an app that can give you stats on how it&rsquo;s doing. However, where&rsquo;s the fun in that? Sometimes, the best use of a Raspberry Pi is to replicate what you could already do, but do it even cooler. Such is the case with this Raspberry Pi project that keeps an eye on how your Pi&rsquo;s CPU is doing and uses a light show to communicate how much load it&rsquo;s experiencing.</p>

		<p>Need a beginner-friendly GUI that&rsquo;s laden with all the essential features to manage your containers? Portainer has your back!</p>
<p>Containers are perfect when you want to isolate your self-hosted services without the extra overhead of virtual machines. While the Docker CLI is the ideal way to manage your containers, running commands for simple operations can get tiresome at times. Docker Desktop is a decent option, but it’s rather rudimentary in its functionality.</p>
