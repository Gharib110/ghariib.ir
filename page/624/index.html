		<p>The holiday season is a time of celebration, but itâ€™s also a high-risk period for cyberattacks.Â Cybercriminals look to exploit reduced staffing, remote work, and the surge in online activity. As everyone scrambles for last-minute deals, these attackers find it easier than ever to slip through the cracks in your defenses. As a system administrator at [â€¦]</p>

	<div>
		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Android OS that could allow for remote code execution.Â Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of this vulnerabilityÂ could allow for remote code execution in the context of the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Apache Struts2, which could allow for remote code execution. Apache Struts2 is an open-source web application framework used for developing Java web applications. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Services whose accounts are configured to have less rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Access Point that could allow for remote code execution. Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Access Point is Ciscoâ€™s solution to address wireless and mobile use case issues facing enterprises. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to replace any file on the underlying file system. The attacker could then perform any of the following actions: add users with root privileges, modify the device configuration, execute arbitrary code, or cause a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.</p>

		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in multiple Cleo products that could allow for remote code execution. Cleoâ€™s LexiCom, VLTransfer, and Harmony is software that is commonly used to manage file transfers. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Containerized application development has revolutionized modern software delivery, but slow image builds in CI/CD pipelines can bring developer productivity to a halt. Even with AWS CodeBuild automating application testing and building, teams face challenges like resource constraints, inefficient caching, and complex multi-architecture builds that lead to delays, lower release frequency, and prolonged recovery times.</p>
<p>Enter Docker Build Cloud, a high-performance cloud service designed to streamline image builds, integrate seamlessly with AWS CodeBuild, and reduce build times dramatically. With Docker Build Cloud, you gain powerful cloud-based builders, shared caching, and native multi-architecture support â€” all while keeping your CI/CD pipelines efficient and your developers focused on delivering value faster.</p>

		<p><strong>Traditional security approaches donâ€™t work for AI.</strong> Generative AI technology is already transforming our world and has immense positive potential for cybersecurity and business processes, but traditional security models and controls arenâ€™t enough to manage the security risks associated with this new technology.â€¯Â Â </p>
<p>We recently published a new whitepaper that examines the security challenges and opportunities from generative AI, what security must do to adapt to manage risk related to it, how a Zero Trust approach is essential to effectively secure this AI technology (and underlying data), and how different roles across your organization must work together for effective AI security.Â Â </p>

		<p>Being a 100% remote company for eight years and counting now, weâ€™ve managed to pick up employees across the world. Situated in North America, South America, all across Europe, and even as far as South Korea! (Hey, Antonia ðŸ‘‹)</p>
<p>Not to be confused with our yearly onsites where the whole company gets together (previous locations including our own private island in Croatia, an eco-retreat in the mountains surrounding Barcelona, and most recently, a whole village in the South of France), the Giant Mansion focuses on our different teams getting together to focus on big rocks that they want to tackle and spend some time working face to face. Weâ€™re strong advocates of 100% remote work, but sometimes we like to hang out with each other too. So in total, twice a year, our employees get together, both in their teams and then together as the whole company.</p>
