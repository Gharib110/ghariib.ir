		<p>Law enforcement agencies have identified Russian national Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov as a key member of the notorious Evil Corp cybercrime group and a LockBit ransomware affiliate.</p>
<p>Ryzhenkov, also known by his alias “Beverley,” has been linked to over 60 LockBit ransomware builds and is believed to have sought to extort at least $100 million from victims in ransom demands.</p>
<p>According to Authorities, Ryzhenkov was unmasked through data obtained during Operation Cronos, a joint investigation with international partners.</p>

		<p>This article will show you how to automatically issue certificates using Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (IdM) and cert-manager operator for OpenShift.</p>
<p>Securing communications is a must, not only to protect the data but to provide greater data integrity as well. Applications achieve greater communications security using cryptographic certificates, but these certificates have their own lifecycle. They need to be renewed when expired and the renewal process, when done manually, is prone to errors.</p>

		<p>IntroductionIn a previous article, I demonstrated how to configure the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) feature included in the Identity Management (IdM) Dogtag Certificate Authority (CA). Specifically, I covered installation of IdM with random serial numbers, and how to enable the ACME service and expired certificate pruning. This article explains the management of ACME (currently a technology preview) with IdM and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.Currently, mod_md is the only ACME client implementation completely supported and provided by Red Hat.

		<p>We continue to expand the scope of our assurance programs at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and are pleased to announce the successful completion of our first ever Protected B High Value Assets (PBHVA) assessment with 149 assessed services and features. Completion of this assessment effective October 4, 2024, makes AWS the first cloud service provider (CSP) in Canada to meet this high security bar and provide assurance to our valued customers. This assessment also re-affirms our commitment to helping public and commercial customers achieve and maintain the highest-grade security standard for workloads with increased sensitivity.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/aws-kms-how-many-keys-do-i-need/">AWS KMS: How many keys do I need?</a></h1>
	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As organizations continue their cloud journeys, effective data security in the cloud is a top priority. Whether it’s protecting customer information, intellectual property, or compliance-mandated data, encryption serves as a fundamental security control. This is where AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) steps in, offering a robust foundation for encryption key management on AWS.</p>
<p>One of the first questions that often arises for customers is, “How many keys do I actually need?” This seemingly simple question requires careful consideration of various factors. Although AWS KMS makes encryption straightforward, organizations need to consider several aspects of their key management strategy. These include choosing between AWS managed keys, customer managed keys, and importing your own keys (BYOK), as well as deciding between centralized and decentralized key management approaches. Each option has its own benefits and trade-offs in terms of security, control, and operational overhead. By understanding these choices and how they align with your organization’s needs, you can develop an effective and efficient key management strategy.</p>

	<div>
		<p>For the second year in a row, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is named as a Leader in the Information Services Group (ISG) Provider Lens Quadrant report for Sovereign Cloud Infrastructure Services (EU), published on December 18, 2024. ISG is a leading global technology research, analyst, and advisory firm that serves as a trusted business partner to more than 900 clients. This ISG report evaluates 19 providers of sovereign cloud infrastructure services in the multi public cloud environment and examines how they address the key challenges that enterprise clients face in the European Union (EU). ISG defines Leaders as providers who represent innovative strength and competitive stability.</p>

	<div>
		<p>AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that provides a convenient way to deploy essential network protections for your virtual private clouds (VPCs). In this blog post, we discuss Geographic IP Filtering, a new feature of Network Firewall that you can use to filter traffic based on geographic location and meet compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Customers with internet-facing applications are constantly in need of advanced security features to protect their applications from threat actors. This includes restricting traffic to and from their workloads in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to certain geographies because of security risk. Customers operating in highly regulated industries—such as banking, public sector, or insurance—might have specific security requirements that can be addressed by Geographic IP Filtering.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Like other security and compliance features in AWS, we will deliver PQC as part of our shared responsibility model. This means that some PQC features will be transparently enabled for all customers while others will be options that customers can choose to implement to help meet their requirements. This transition will happen in phases, starting with systems that communicate over untrusted networks such as the internet.</p>

We’re excited to announce that AWS-LC FIPS 3.0 has been added to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) modules in process list. This latest validation of AWS-LC introduces support for Module Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM), the new FIPS standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. This is a significant step towards enhancing the long-term confidentiality of our most sensitive customer workflows, including U.S. federal government communications.</p>

In deep mid-winter nothing beats curling up with a good book, in-front of a roaring fire – the crackle of all the unwanted Christmas tat your nearest and dearest bought you chars, melts, and burns providing a warm aural soundtrack. Thankfully, not everyone’s feeling as seasonably irascible as I am – like the folks behind open-source ebook reader, manager, and converter Calibre. They’ve hand-wrapped a bug-fix update to help tide us over the festive season. Hurrah! As gifts that arrive in late December go, Calibre 7.23 is a modest one: more ‘last-minute box of chocs’ than something you really wanted […]</p>
