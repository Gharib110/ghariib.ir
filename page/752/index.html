<p>We talked about the Comcast Xfinity applicances and how they have a vulnerability that could make it appear that traffic created by people outside of your house could look like it was coming from your home network.</p>
<p>We discuss the public disclosure of Carbon Black&rsquo;s architecture and seeming sharing of customer events to 3rd parties&hellip; it&rsquo;s not all black and white, and we discuss those here.</p>

<p>Ally Miller (@selenakyle) joined us this week to discuss Machine Learning and #Artificial #Intelligence. It seems like every new security product employs one or both of these terms. She did the keynote at Bsides Las Vegas on topics of #Machine #Learning and #Behavioral #Economics.</p>
<p>We asked Ms. Miller to join us here to discuss what ML and AI are, how algorithms work to analyze the data to come to the right conclusion. What is required to get a useful algorithm, and how much or little human interaction is required?</p>

<p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is weighing on the minds and pocketbooks of a lot of European companies, but is the US as worried? If you read many of the news articles out there, it ranges from &lsquo;meh&rsquo; to &lsquo;OMG, the sky, it is falling&quot;. GDPR will cause a lot of new issues in the way business is being done, not just in the realm of security, but in the way data is managed, maintained, catalogued, and shared.</p>

<p>The infosec industry and the infosec culture is so diverse, with many different points of view, many different thoughts and opinions, and many of us deal with our own internal demons, like addictions, mental afflictions like depression or bipolar disorders. And &lsquo;imposter syndrome&rsquo; is another thing that seems to add to the mix, making some believe they have to be constantly innovating or people think negatively of them.</p>

<p>Jay Beale works for a pentest firm called &ldquo;Inguardians&rdquo;, and has always been a fierce friend of the show. He&rsquo;s running a class at both BlackHat and Defcon all about hardening various parts of the Linux OS. This week, we discuss some of the concepts he teaches in the class. </p>
<p>Why do we disable Selinux? Is it as difficult to enable as everyone believes? What benefit do we get from using it? </p>

<p>This week, we discuss hardening of windows hosts, utilizing CIS benchmarks. We talk about the &lsquo;auditpol&rsquo; command. And we dredge up from the ancient times (2000) the Microsoft article from Scott Culp &ldquo;The 10 Immutable Laws of Security Administration&rdquo;. Are they still applicable to today&rsquo;s environment, 17 years later?</p>
<p><strong>Brakesec also announces our &ldquo;PowerShell for Blue Teamers and Incident Responders&rdquo; with Mick Douglas (@bettersafetynet). A 6 week course starting with the basics of powershell, and goes into discussion of frameworks using Powershell too assist in assessing your network. It starts on 10 July and run each Monday evening until 14 August 2017. You&rsquo;ll receive a certificate suitable for CPE credit, as well as the videos of the class available to you on our YouTube channel.</strong></p>

<p>Michael Gough (@hackerHurricane) and Mr. Boettcher (BrakeSec Co-Host, and @boettcherpwned) sit down and discuss the popularity of ransomware as a topic</p>
<p>They discuss what email attachments to block, how to test your own email gateway, and what controls you should implement to help defend against the #petya #notpetya ransomware.</p>

<p>One topic we discussed this week was how to reach out to small businesses about information security. Mr. Boettcher (@boettcherpwned) had just came from a panel discussion about an initiative in Austin, Texas called &ldquo;MANIFEST&rdquo;, which sought to engage small business owners with #information #security professionals to help them secure their environments.</p>
<p>So we got to discussing how you might go about it in your local hometowns. Many of us live in smaller towns, with numerous small businesses that either don&rsquo;t know to secure their #POS #terminals (for example), or office information not in a file cabinet. They may also just assume their outsourced IT company is doing that job, which could open them up to liability if something occurred. So we discuss ways to reach out, or get involved with your local community.</p>

<p>We also discuss EclinicalWorks and their massive fine for falsifying testing of their EHR system, and implications for that. What happens to customers confidence in the product, and what happens if you&rsquo;re already a customer and realize you were duped by them?</p>
<p>We also discuss Hector&rsquo;s involvement with the TV show &ldquo;Outlaw Tech&rdquo;. Who approached him, why he did it, why it&rsquo;s not CSI:Cyber or &ldquo;Scorpion&rdquo; and how it discusses the techniques used by bad guys.</p>
