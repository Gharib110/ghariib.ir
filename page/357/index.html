		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a step-by-step guide highlighting how to install Windows 11 on a new PC.</p>
<p>Building a new PC can be a fun but somewhat daunting process, especially if you&rsquo;re doing it for the first time. Even if you run into some challenges, it&rsquo;s usually worth it for the feeling of turning it on for the first time knowing you have a faster (presumably) better experience waiting for you. Then there&rsquo;s that moment when you realize you still have to install an operating system, such as Windows 11.</p>

<p><em>The Network and Information Security Directive, known as NIS2 and effective beginning October 17, 2024, requires Member States to adopt and publish the national measures necessary to ensure compliance with the directive. Industrial organizations will have 21 months to bring their operations into full compliance.</em></p>

		<p>As the CEO of Tuta Mail, an encrypted email service that TechCrunch has called the &ldquo;encrypted Gmail alternative&rdquo;, I welcome the Department of Justice’s bold move to rein in Google’s dominance. This landmark decision isn’t just about regulating a single company — it’s about standing up for fairness, competition, and a healthier internet ecosystem.</p>

<p>The myth that humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity has persisted for too long. While it’s true that human errors can lead to vulnerabilities, and do indeed cause breaches or incidents, this well repeated narrative overlooks a critical truth: when properly empowered and supported, humans are not just a liability to manage—they are your greatest asset in building a resilient cybersecurity culture.</p>

<p>Imagine your organization&rsquo;s cyber defenses as a well-trained emergency response team. (Work with us here). Just like a strong immune system in a healthy body can fight off infections or the same defensive posture will snap into place in a well trained police unit, <strong>Cyber Resilience in the Human Landscape</strong> means the ability for every person in your organization to be prepared to act swiftly and effectively when cyber threats arise. We think the real magic to this lies not just in the technology but in the behavioral and psychological realm. How quickly and efficiently your people can respond is a question of knowledge, mindset, procedure, behavior, and culture. </p>
