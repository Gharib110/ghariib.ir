<p>I decided to write this post because there&rsquo;s no concise way to explain the nuances of what&rsquo;s being described as one of the largest data breaches ever. Usually, it&rsquo;s easy to articulate a data breach; a service people provide their information to had someone snag it through an act of unauthorised access and publish a discrete corpus of information that can be attributed back to that source. But in the case of National Public Data, we&rsquo;re talking about a data aggregator most people had never heard of where a &ldquo;threat actor&rdquo; has published various <em>partial</em> sets of data with no clear way to attribute it back to the source. And they&rsquo;re already the subject of a class action, to add yet another variable into the mix. I&rsquo;ve been collating information related to this incident over the last couple of months, so let me talk about what&rsquo;s known about the incident, what data is circulating and what remains a bit of a mystery.</p>

<p>I hate having to use that word - &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; - because it&rsquo;s so inconclusive and I know it will leave people with many unanswered questions. (<strong>Edit:</strong> 12 days after publishing this blog post, it looks like the &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; caveat can be dropped, see the addition at the end of the post for more.) But sometimes, &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; is just where we need to begin and over the course of time, proper attribution is made and the dots are joined. We&rsquo;re here at &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; for two very simple reasons: one is that AT&amp;T is saying &ldquo;the data didn&rsquo;t come from us&rdquo;, and the other is that I have no way of proving otherwise. But I have proven, with sufficient confidence, that the data is real and the impact is significant. Let me explain:</p>

		<p>Flow Launcher and PowerToys Run can both make the Start menu obsolete on Windows 11. But which one is actually better?</p>
<p>For most people, opening apps with the Start menu and desktop icons works totally fine. But if you&rsquo;re someone who spends a lot of time on the computer and you want to do things as efficiently as possible, a custom launcher becomes almost a necessity as it speeds things up a lot.</p>

<p>111 years ago almost to the day, a murder was committed which ultimately led to the first criminal trial to use fingerprints as evidence. We&rsquo;ve all since watched enough crime shows to understand that fingerprints are unique personal biometric attributes and to date, no two people have ever been found to have a matching set. As technology has evolved, fingers (and palms and irises and faces) have increasingly been used as a means of biometric authentication. I&rsquo;m writing this on a PC that uses a Verifi fingerprint reader. I&rsquo;ll probably continue to draft it from a comfy spot later on using my Lenovo laptop that has a built in reader. I&rsquo;ll also go backwards and forward between my iPhone and iPad with Face ID.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5) is a powerful single-board computer that can do almost anything. Unlike regular computers, it is designed to work perfectly with custom hardware, so you can choose how much storage, memory, and wireless power you need. It’s small and can be used in all sorts of cool ways, from building smart home devices to making robots.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t let dust and other particles beat you and your mighty system.</p>
<p>Dust is your PC&rsquo;s worst nightmare. It infiltrates the chassis, lands on a component, and starts to accumulate over time. Too much dust can create a layer of insulation, causing the hardware to run hotter than usual. Clogging up fans could result in less air being forced through vents and the performance of everything inside your PC will be compromised. Luckily, keeping dust outside your PC, or at least keeping on top of the stuff that makes it inside your system, is easier than you may think.</p>
