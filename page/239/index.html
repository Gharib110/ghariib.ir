		<p>See why I should have nver gotten a Photoshop subscription.</p>
<p>Photoshop has long been hailed as the gold standard for photo editing and digital design, but my experience with its subscription model has not been ideal. While its advanced toolset is undeniably powerful, the steep cost and complexity left me questioning its value and considering Photoshop alternatives. I&rsquo;ll explore why I regret subscribing to Photoshop, highlighting my challenges and frustrations that make it less appealing to those who want affordability and simplicity.</p>

		<p>Ansible may seem a tad overkill for the average user, but it can simplify network management for your home lab</p>
<p>Experimenting with wacky projects is one of the biggest perks of a home lab, though spinning up a VM with the same ol’ OS and configuration settings can get tiresome after a while. Thankfully, certain apps like Ansible can make your life a lot easier by helping you automate the tedious virtual machine provisioning process.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re weighing up whether you should get a NAS or a DAS for your media library, this might help you make up your mind.</p>
<p>Self-hosting your own data can be a rewarding experience, knowing that you control all of it and can upgrade the amount of storage you have as you need to. However, you may be weighing whether you should get a NAS or a DAS, and there are pros and cons when it comes to a DAS specifically.</p>

		<p>Krita hidden features that can boost efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>Krita is a fantastic open-source tool for creative image manipulation. While Krita is one of many alternatives to Photoshop, it stands alone as a go-to creative tool for many digital artists and illustrators, even for digital illustration from tabletstoo. Krita has many obvious tools and features, like layers, brushes, shapes, and selection tools, but it also provides many hidden features you should use to boost your creative workflow further.</p>

<p>Whether you are a seasoned programmer, a network engineer in training, or a cybersecurity expert, a well-equipped home lab can be your secret weapon for experimentation and skill development. But, with so many tools and technologies available, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. Before you give up or drain your budget on unnecessary items and software, glance over my listicle to form the foundation of your home lab.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re self-hosting any services, you&rsquo;ll want a reverse proxy as another layer of defense.</p>
<p>Once your home network starts getting more complex, like if you were to start self-hosting apps and services, you might want to consider setting up a reverse proxy to shield those services from the internet. This is essentially another server that sits between the device your self-hosted apps are on and the internet, but instead of providing access outward to the internet, it provides access to those apps.</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong> <strong>(April 19):</strong> <em>Yilei Chen announced the discovery of a bug in the algorithm, which he does not know how to fix. This was independently discovered by Hongxun Wu and Thomas Vidick. At present, the paper does not provide a polynomial-time algorithm for solving LWE.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a normal person — that is, a person who doesn’t obsessively follow the latest cryptography news — you probably missed last week’s cryptography bombshell. That news comes in the form of a new e-print authored by Yilei Chen, “Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems“, which has roiled the cryptography research community. The result is now being evaluated by experts in lattices and quantum algorithm design (<em>and to be clear, I am not one!</em>) but if it holds up, it’s going to be quite a bad day/week/month/year for the applied cryptography community.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>ABLE: Optimizing Mixed Arithmetic and Boolean Garbled Circuit</strong><br>
<em>Jianqiao Cambridge Mo, Brandon Reagen</em></p>
<p>Privacy and security have become critical priorities in many scenarios. Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) is a powerful solution that allows functions to be computed directly on encrypted data. Garbled circuit (GC) is a key PPC technology that enables secure, confidential computing. GC comes in two forms: Boolean GC supports all operations by expressing functions as logic circuits; arithmetic GC is a newer technique to efficiently compute a set of arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. Mixed GC combines both Boolean and arithmetic GC, in an attempt to optimize performance by computing each function in its most natural form. However, this introduces additional costly conversions between the two forms. It remains unclear if and when the efficiency gains of arithmetic GC outweigh these conversion costs.</p>
