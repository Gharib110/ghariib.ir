<p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding optional static types. This allows developers to catch errors early and write more maintainable code. Types are essentially contracts that define what kind of data can be stored and manipulated. They help ensure that your code operates as expected, reducing runtime errors related to incorrect data types. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning TypeScript or using AI tools like gpteach to enhance your coding skills, consider subscribing or following my blog!</p>

<p>TypeScript is a powerful programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static types. It allows developers to specify the data types of variables, function parameters, and return values, which can help catch errors early in the development process. But what are types? In programming, types are classifications that specify what kind of value a variable can hold—like numbers, strings, or objects. TypeScript’s type system helps in defining these classifications, providing better tooling and error checking.</p>

		<p>See why I should have nver gotten a Photoshop subscription.</p>
<p>Photoshop has long been hailed as the gold standard for photo editing and digital design, but my experience with its subscription model has not been ideal. While its advanced toolset is undeniably powerful, the steep cost and complexity left me questioning its value and considering Photoshop alternatives. I&rsquo;ll explore why I regret subscribing to Photoshop, highlighting my challenges and frustrations that make it less appealing to those who want affordability and simplicity.</p>

<p>Experimenting with wacky projects is one of the biggest perks of a home lab, though spinning up a VM with the same ol’ OS and configuration settings can get tiresome after a while. Thankfully, certain apps like Ansible can make your life a lot easier by helping you automate the tedious virtual machine provisioning process.</p>

		<p>Krita hidden features that can boost efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>Krita is a fantastic open-source tool for creative image manipulation. While Krita is one of many alternatives to Photoshop, it stands alone as a go-to creative tool for many digital artists and illustrators, even for digital illustration from tabletstoo. Krita has many obvious tools and features, like layers, brushes, shapes, and selection tools, but it also provides many hidden features you should use to boost your creative workflow further.</p>
