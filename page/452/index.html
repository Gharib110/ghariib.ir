		<p>Git push is a regular process used by developers to send changes to a remote repository. Recently, I noticed that I committed a few unnecessary files and pushed them to the remote Git repository. These files were not required and should have been excluded. To fix this, I plan to remove them from the repository and update the <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid pushing such files in the future.</p>
<p>To delete the last pushed commit, you can follow these steps. Make sure you understand the implications of rewriting commit history, especially if working in a shared repository.</p>

		<p>Linux provides several powerful tools to monitor system performance, especially memory and CPU usage. Sometimes we need to identify the processes that are consuming high memory and CPU to troubleshoot performance issues. You can use preinstalled system utilities like ps, top commands or external tools like htop, vmstats etc. Each tool comes with different advantages.</p>
<p>This article explains how to identify the top processes consuming memory and CPU using simple commands.</p>

Ubuntu Pro is an optional security feature that Ubuntu LTS users can enable to receive critical updates for an extra 25,000 packages which would otherwise sit unpatched. If you use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS you will have seen Ubuntu Pro security updates in Software Updater (or when running apt commands). And you will have noticed you can’t install those updates without having an Ubuntu Pro subscription. Ubuntu Pro is free for all users on up to 5 machines, meaning the only ‘cost’ involved is the time it takes to register and setup Ubuntu Pro. Businesses (or home users) with fleets of […]</p>

		<p>Maintaining secure and efficient network access is crucial for distributed companies.

<p>Tailscale operates on a concept known as a mesh VPN, where devices communicate directly instead of routing traffic through a central server. This structure not only increases speed and reliability but also simplifies network configuration for remote teams. By leveraging Tailscale, businesses can build a private network accessible from anywhere in the world, effectively streamlining their digital workspace.</p>
