<h3 id="introducing-campaigns-to-mitreattck"><strong>Introducing Campaigns to MITRE ATT&amp;CK</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>By:</em></strong> <em>Amy Robertson, Jared Ondricek, and Matt Malone</em></p>
<p>We’ve talked about building Campaigns into ATT&amp;CK in our ATT&amp;CK 2022 roadmap, at ATT&amp;CKCon 3.0, and most recently on the SANS Threat Analysis Rundown but their release is now nigh! Our initial collection of Campaigns will be available starting with our ATT&amp;CK v12 release on October 25, when you’ll be able to leverage the Campaigns structure for all of your ATT&amp;CK use cases. Prior to the release, we’re taking the opportunity to walk you through our vision for Campaigns, give you a tour of Campaigns elements, and cover our longer-term Campaigns plans.</p>

		<p>As we soon celebrate our 10th birthday, we&rsquo;ve been reflecting on what&rsquo;s driven us since those early days — a mission to make our customers happy. That founding spirit fuels our excitement for Giant Swarm Platform 3.0.</p>
<p>This release is special because it marries the hard-earned knowledge we&rsquo;ve gained from a decade of managing Kubernetes clusters in production with the most effective open source tools out there. It&rsquo;s not just about chasing trends; it&rsquo;s about taking a thoughtful, battle-tested approach to building a platform that truly works for you.</p>

</p>
<p>Remember GNOME Pie or Fly-Pie? There’s now a similar pie menu launcher for most Linux desktops as well as Windows and macOS.</p>
<p>It’s Kando, a free open-source application written mostly in TypeScript programming language.</p>
<p>With it, user can trigger a circular application launcher on desktop, then either use mouse clicks or draw gesture to launch apps, run custom scripts/commands, simulate shortcut key, or open files/websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://ubuntuhandbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/kando-piemenu.mp4">https://ubuntuhandbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/kando-piemenu.mp4</a></p>
<p>Kando is designed to be used with mouse, stylus, touch, or controller input. It works in Windows, macOS, and Linux with most desktop environments, such as GNOME, KDE, MATE, XFCE, and Cinnamon, though some (e.g., Cosmic and Niri) are so far not implemented.</p>

<p>Mixxx, the free and open-source DJ software, released new major 2.5.0 version today!</p>
<p>The new release now uses <strong>Qt6 by default</strong> for its user interface, offering improved performance and enhanced compatibility with modern systems. Qt5 is still supported, but will be removed in the next 2.6 release series.</p>
<p>Probably due to this change, Ubuntu 20.04 is no longer officially supported, though user can choose to use the Flatpak package run in sandbox environment.</p>

		<p>mongoaudit is a CLI tool for MongoDB auditing of servers, detecting poor security settings and performing automated penetration testing. It is widely known that there are quite a few holes in MongoDB’s default configuration settings. This fact, combined with abundant lazy system administrators and developers, has led to what the press has called the MongoDB […]</p>

In more recent months it was noted that Zeus has become more focused and variations of Zeus were found to be targeting banks and financial organisations in specific geographic […]</p>

It’s mostly targeted at the UK though, worms of these type usually are geographically limited as they are targeting bank information – it’s better […]</p>

		<p>Since its inception in 2014, Giant Swarm has been 100% remote — not as an afterthought or a late-minute addendum but as part of its core (and I think very cool) founding philosophy. </p>
<p>An ever-evolving philosophy that challenges the status quo and invites us to do things better and differently, all while not taking itself too seriously. As our VP People Anna noted, <em>“Being remote is just a form of organization. You need human structures and psychological safety regardless.&quot;</em></p>
