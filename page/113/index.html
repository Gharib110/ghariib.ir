	<div>
		<p>One challenge of managing models in production environments with Red Hat OpenShift AI and KServe is the dependency on S3-compatible storage. When serving models using KServe in OpenShift AI, users must deploy S3-compatible storage somewhere accessible in their cluster and then upload their model to an S3 bucket. Managing models through S3 creates new challenges for traditional operations teams deploying production services. Teams may need to create new processes to promote model artifacts from development/test environments.</p>

		<p>Key Takeaways for Control 4 Most fresh installs of operating systems or applications come with preconfigured settings that are usually insecure or not properly configured with security in mind. Use the leverage provided by multiple frameworks such as CIS Benchmarks or NIST NCP to find out if your organization needs to augment or adjust any baselines to become better aligned with the policies your organization is trying to adhere to. Throughout the CIS Controls, many controls will play off one another, or some may need data from previous controls to get a better understanding of what is secure&hellip;</p>

		<p>During the past several months there have been numerous malware campaigns that use a technique something referred to as “ClickFix”. It often consists of a fake CAPTCHA or similar traffic validation page where visitors are instructed to paste and execute code in order to proceed.</p>
<p>We have started to see ClickFix attacks more and more via malicious Google ads as well. This is in contrast to typical phishing pages where victims download a so-called installer that contains malware.</p>

Ubuntu’s key developers have agreed to switch to Matrix as the primary platform for real-time development communications involving the distro. From March, Matrix will replace IRC as the place where critical Ubuntu development conversations, requests, meetings, and other vital chatter must take place. Developers asked to ensure they have a presence on the platform so they are reachable. Only the current #ubuntu-devel and #ubuntu-release Libera IRC channels are moving to Matrix, but other Ubuntu development-related channels can choose to move –officially, given some projects were using Matrix over IRC already. As a result, any major requests to/of the key Ubuntu […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Legislators—Congressmen and Senators—routinely receive material non-public information that is crucial to crafting legislation for the US government to operate efficiently and meet the needs of the American people. Unfortunately, many legislators use this information to enrich themselves at the expense of the very people they are elected to represent. Using privileged information for personal gain is a tremendous abuse of power and tantamount to graft. Service in the Congress is an honor. Legislators, senior officials in the executive and judicial branches, and their families should be prohibited from trading in individual securities. Those officials who have profited from this abuse of power have revealed their lack of moral fiber and should no longer serve in government. </p>
