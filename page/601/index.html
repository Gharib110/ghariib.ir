	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Survey data and discussions with enterprise networking professionals reveal they are still grappling with many networking issues spawned by the expansion of the cloud – the most common of which include <strong>securing connections</strong> for remote work, implementing zero-trust security strategies, and integrating myriad cloud and wide-area networks (WANs).</p>
<p>For example, in <strong>Futuriom’s</strong> latest survey of 196 enterprise IT and networking professionals, more than 80% said the complexity of connecting the wide variety of networks was a large challenge. At nearly 70% of responses, expertise and knowledge was the second-largest challenge (multiple responses were allowed), and cost was cited by 60%.  Please refer to survey highlights below.</p>

<p>As we prepare to step into 2025, cloud security continues to remodel in response to emerging needs – the wide adoption of AI, regulatory demands and increasing cyberthreats. Our company’s cloud security leaders are on the heels of these threats with Palo Alto Networks global 2025 predictions, laying out the top cloud security predictions for the coming year.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, protecting cloud environments won’t just be the top priority – it will be imperative. With organizations moving substantial amounts of data for AI-driven workflows to the cloud, the dependency on cloud infrastructures has taken on new depths. This shift, coupled with the expanding attack surface, has magnified the importance of comprehensive strategies for cloud security.</p>
