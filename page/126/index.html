<p>DeepSeek has captured the world’s attention this week, with an unexpected release of the more-open AI model from China, for a reported mere $5 million training cost. While there’s lots of buzz about DeepSeek, here we’re interested in security. And DeepSeek has made waves there, in the form of a ClickHouse database unintentionally opened to the world, discovered by the folks from Wiz research. That database contained chat history and log streams, and API keys and other secrets by extension.</p>

The Thunderbird email client is making its monthly ‘release channel’ builds the default download starting in March. “We’re excited to announce that starting with the 135.0 release in March 2025, the Thunderbird Release channel will be the default download,” Corey Bryant, manager of Thunderbird Release Operations, shares in an update on the project’s discussion hub. Right now, users who visit the Thunderbird website and hit the giant download get the latest Extended Support Release (ESR) build by default. It gets one major feature update a year plus smaller bug fix and security updates issued in-between. The version of Thunderbird Ubuntu […]</p>

<p>Financially motivated hackers are behind an ongoing malicious campaign targeting Poland and Germany. These phishing attacks aim to deploy multiple payloads, including Agent Tesla, Snake Keylogger, and a novel backdoor dubbed TorNet, which is delivered via PureCrypter malware. </p>
<h2 id="detect-tornet-backdoor">Detect TorNet Backdoor</h2>
<p>A significant rise in phishing campaigns, with a 202% increase in phishing messages over the second half of 2024, indicates that this attack vector continues to be a persistent threat. The emergence of a TorNet backdoor distributed via PureCrypter malware in an ongoing phishing campaign, which uses advanced detection evasion techniques, requires swift and proactive responses from defenders. </p>

<p>With cyber threats on the rise, organizations are increasingly concerned about their security posture. One area of prime concern is web applications and APIs that power key business processes. To protect mission-critical applications, efficient web application firewalls (WAFs) are required to block malicious traffic. A well-configured WAF acts as the first line of defense against external threats maintaining trust, achieving compliance, and ensuring uninterrupted operations. Periodic testing of security solutions ensures they are behaving as expected and are resilient enough to withstand complex and ever-evolving cyber threats. Often, resource-constrained security teams do not have the time to proactively test their […]</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that aims to simulate human intelligence through machines. AI can be classified into three distinct modes based on its capabilities: <strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</strong>, <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>, and <strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong>. These modes represent the stages of AI development and define its potential and limitations.</p>
<p>While <strong>ANI</strong> is already a part of many industries today, <strong>AGI</strong> and <strong>ASI</strong> represent future milestones in AI evolution. This post will explore each of the three modes of AI, their major features, and the implications they have for technology and society.</p>
