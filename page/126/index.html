		<p>The pretty lights mean you&rsquo;re torturing your processor.</p>
<p>If you want to keep tabs on your Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s CPU usage, you can always use the built-in tools on your OS or download an app that can give you stats on how it&rsquo;s doing. However, where&rsquo;s the fun in that? Sometimes, the best use of a Raspberry Pi is to replicate what you could already do, but do it even cooler. Such is the case with this Raspberry Pi project that keeps an eye on how your Pi&rsquo;s CPU is doing and uses a light show to communicate how much load it&rsquo;s experiencing.</p>

		<p>With the announcement of the Nintentdo Switch 2, we&rsquo;re hoping for a few needed upgrades.</p>
<p>If you want a top-notch portable gaming machine, sure you could get yourself a laptop or a tablet, but gaming handhelds are all the rage.

		<p>Need a beginner-friendly GUI that&rsquo;s laden with all the essential features to manage your containers? Portainer has your back!</p>
<p>Containers are perfect when you want to isolate your self-hosted services without the extra overhead of virtual machines. While the Docker CLI is the ideal way to manage your containers, running commands for simple operations can get tiresome at times. Docker Desktop is a decent option, but it‚Äôs rather rudimentary in its functionality.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a different browser, see why I used Opera GX.</p>
<p>We all wish our browsers could do things better, but we generally stick to mainstream options like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge because we&rsquo;re stuck in their ecosystem and put faith in their abilities. Still, variety is the spice of life, and it&rsquo;s worth trying some forgotten browsers to check out their unique features and design choices, which might surprise you.</p>
