<p>In recognition of International Data Protection Day, Check Point Software has underscored the critical importance of data privacy as a strategic priority for organizations worldwide. No longer merely a compliance obligation, data privacy has become a competitive advantage, reinforcing customer trust, enabling innovation, and enhancing operational resilience. “In today’s digital world, privacy is not just about compliance—it’s about trust,” said Mark Weir, regional director for the UK &amp; Ireland at Check Point Software Technologies. “Organizations that prioritize data privacy gain a significant advantage, not just in regulatory adherence, but in fostering customer confidence, ensuring business continuity, and driving sustainable growth.” The […]</p>

		<p>Learn how to protect against the abuse of AWS Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) in ransomware campaigns.</p>
<p>Ransomware actors are increasingly abusing native cloud features to target critical data. A recent threat actor campaign, as detailed in the Halcyon blog, was observed abusing Amazon Web Services (AWS) Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). By encrypting S3 objects with their own keys, attackers render data irretrievable, abusing AWS features and services through the use of stolen credentials in an attempt to simplify their efforts with less infrastructure to manage.</p>

		<p>Cloudflare proudly leads the way with our approach to data privacy and the protection of personal information, and we’ve been an ardent supporter of the need for the free flow of data across jurisdictional borders. So today, on Data Privacy Day (also known internationally as Data Protection Day), we’re happy to announce that we’re adding our fourth and fifth privacy validations, and this time, they are global firsts! Cloudflare is the first organisation to announce that we have been successfully audited against the brand new Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (Global CBPRs) for data controllers and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (Global PRP). These validations demonstrate our support and adherence to global standards that provide for privacy-respecting data flows across jurisdictions. Organizations that have been successfully audited will be formally certified when the certifications officially launch, which we expect to happen later in 2025. </p>

		<p>January 27 marks the International Holocaust Remembrance Day — a solemn occasion to honor the memory of the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, along with countless others who fell victim to the Nazi regime&rsquo;s campaign of hatred and intolerance. This tragic chapter in human history serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of prejudice and extremism. </p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau —  as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This year, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of this infamous extermination camp.</p>

		<p>In the past decade, Oracle Database (Oracle DB) has reigned supreme in the competitive arena of database engine popularity ranking as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This pervasiveness has led Oracle Database to be trusted by Fortune 500 companies (e.g. Netflix, LinkedIn, eBay, etc.) to house, process, and safeguard their critical data. Its popularity can be attributed to its ability to handle massive volumes of data and concurrent transactions with high performance, making Oracle Database optimized for enterprise-level workloads, where speed, efficiency, and reliability are critical.</p>
