<p>Amands writes: &ldquo;I had an amazing time at my 3rd #Shmoocon. I was able to interview a handful of really cool people working on several different types of infosec education. I was able to watch a few talks, spend some time in the lockpick village, as well as go to Shmoocon Epilogue. It’s always amazing to watch people talk about what they are passionate about, and Shmoocon is a great relaxed environment where that happens frequently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what if your company cannot afford such products, or are not ready to engage those types of companies, and still need need protections? Never fear, there are open source options available (see show notes below). These products aren&rsquo;t perfect, but they will provide a modicum of protection from &lsquo;known&rsquo; bad actors, SSH trolls, etc.</p>

<p>We start out talking about new #California #legislation about making #malware illegal. What are politicians in California thinking? We work through that and try to find some understanding.</p>
<p>With all the various secure messaging systems out there, we discuss how why secure messaging systems fail so poorly with regards to #interoperability and the difficulties in getting average non-infosec people to adopt one. We also discuss #Perfect #Foward #Security and how it prevents people from decrypting old messages, even if the key is compromised.</p>

<p>I also issue an &lsquo;open-letter&rsquo; to C-Level. We need C-Levels to listen and accept the knowledge and experience of your people. Infosec people are often the only thing keeping a company from making the front page, and yet are still seen as speed bumps.</p>
<p>We also discuss some the previous episodes of the year, some recent developments to build our #community, like our book club and upcoming #CTF club.</p>

<p>Jerry #Bell (@maliciousLink) and Andrew #Kalat (@lerg) from the #Defensive Security podcast (@defensiveSec)</p>
<p>And Amanda #Berlin (@infosystir) for a light-hearted holiday party. We discuss things we learned this year, and most of us refrained from making the famous &ldquo;#prediction&rdquo; lists. You also get to hear my lovely wife come in and bring me #holiday #sweeties and even dinner, as she had no idea we were recording at the time (she later told me &ldquo;You sounded like you were having too much fun, so I assumed you weren&rsquo;t recording&rdquo;)</p>

<p>A lot of times as #blue #teamers, we find ourselves in the sights of a #sales person, or often enough, we are inviting them into our conference rooms to find out how their widget will help save the day. There&rsquo;s an art to the concept of selling, honed over the past 500,000 years, since Ugg tried to convince Oog that his wheel would revolutionize work&hellip;</p>

<p>Gary walks us through the 7 Kingdoms of getting more security in, including doing automated and manual code audits, proper penetration testing of the application at various stages (testing), documentation (if you don&rsquo;t know it works, how can you test it?), and your Security Operations people, monitoring for things once it goes into production.  Also, find out what Chapter he thinks you should skip altogether&hellip; the answer may surprise you&hellip; :)</p>
