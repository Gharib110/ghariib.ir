		<p>The rapid adoption of cloud technology in the past few years has transformed IT environments, enabling unprecedented opportunities for flexibility, scalability, and collaboration. However, this transformation has introduced a potentially dangerous level of complexity into these environments – recent research from PwC revealed that 75% of executives report too much complexity in their organizations, leading to ‘concerning’ cyber and privacy risks. To navigate this complexity, modern organizations need security controls that keep pace with rapidly evolving IT environments. In this article, we’ll&hellip;</p>

		<p>Your main business is healthcare, so your excuse when you get hacked is that you didn’t have the budget to secure your network. Am I right?</p>
<p>So, in order to prevent a ransomware gang from infiltrating your network, you could just give them what they want—all your data.</p>
<p>The seemingly preferred method to accomplish this is to leave the information unprotected and unencrypted in an exposed Amazon S3 bucket.</p>
<p>An S3 bucket is like a virtual file folder in the cloud where you can store various types of data, such as text files, images, videos, and more. There is no limit to the amount of data you can store in an S3 bucket, and individual instances can be up to 5 TB in size.</p>

<p>This time, 5 million US credit cards and personal details were leaked online. The Leakd.com security team discovered that 5 terabytes of sensitive screenshots were exposed in a freely accessible Amazon S3 bucket.</p>

<p>The miniature Christmas village is a tradition in many families — a tiny idyllic world filled happy people, shops, and of course, snow. It’s common to see various miniature buildings for sale around the holidays just for this purpose, and since LEDs are small and cheap, they’ll almost always have some switch on the bottom to light up the windows.</p>
<p>This year, [Braden Sunwold] and his wife started their own village with an eye towards making it a family tradition. But to his surprise, the scale lamp posts they bought to dot along their snowy main street were hollow and didn’t actually light up. Seeing it was up to him to save Christmas, [Braden] got to work adding LEDs to the otherwise inert lamps.</p>

		<p>As we look ahead to 2025, one thing is clear: the digital landscape is evolving quickly, and it’s creating new cybersecurity challenges for businesses globally. From the growing speed, scale and sophistication of cyberattacks to the changing nature of how we work and connect, the future of network security depends on a holistic approach that integrates advanced AI technologies and seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In fact, Palo Alto Networks 2025 Cybersecurity and AI Predictions showcase how we’re at a pivotal moment in the evolution of enterprise security practices. One of the standout predictions we made was that 2025 will be the year enterprises will widely adopt a secure browser. This trend is not only an inevitability, it’s a necessity. ​​While secure browsers will see a huge increase in adoption in the year ahead, they represent only one piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Privacy is many things for many people.</p>
<p>For the teenager suffering from a bad breakup, privacy is the ability to stop sharing her location and to block her ex on social media. For the political dissident advocating against an oppressive government, privacy is the protection that comes from secure, digital communications. And for the California resident who wants to know exactly how they’re being included in so many targeted ads, privacy is the legal right to ask a marketing firm how they collect their data.</p>

<p><em>Authored by Dexter Shin</em></p>
<p>Over the years, cyber threats targeting Android devices have become more sophisticated and persistent. Recently, McAfee Mobile Research Team discovered a new Android banking trojan targeting Indian users. This malware disguises itself as essential services, such as utility (e.g., gas or electricity) or banking apps, to get sensitive information from users. These types of services are vital for daily life, making it easier to lure users. We have previously observed malware that masquerades as utility services in Japan. As seen in such cases, utility-related messages, such as warnings that gas service will disconnect soon unless the bill is checked, can cause significant alarm and prompt immediate action from the users.</p>
