It is a great little pocket rocket and having a landscape orientation and hardware keyboard, is well suited for a native Kali installation with a full <a href="https://lxqt.org/">LXQT</a> desktop environment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-1,256/">Raven</a> is another boot2root challenge currently available for download at <a href="https://vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a>. One of the cool things about Raven is it’s actually kind of realistic and a fairly easy challenge, which makes it a great boot2root for learning how to hack. I had been wanting to do a sort of tutorial for beginners for a while now, and I think Raven is a good challenge to do this writeup on. So unlike my previous writeups where I just mention the tools or techniques I use to escalate to root privileges, I’ll spend more time in this one talking about my thought processes, and my failures. Just in case anyone thinks it takes me 5 minutes to solve these challenges, it doesn’t. There’s a lot of swearing, and red herrings along the way.</p>
