		<p>SentinelOne achieves 100% detection and zero detection delays in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® Evaluations: Enterprise 2024.</p>
<p>In cybersecurity, speed and accuracy are necessities. Every second counts, and every detection could be the difference between resilience and breach. That’s why SentinelOne takes immense pride in protecting our customers, monitoring trillions of signals annually across organizations from SMBs to Fortune 10 enterprises to top government entities and critical infrastructure. With visibility into the most sophisticated threats, we’ve detected and disrupted countless ransomware attacks, thwarted advanced eCrime and nation state adversaries, and ensured operations remain protected against evolving risks.</p>

		<p>The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Program is a framework developed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to enforce cybersecurity requirements and protect sensitive unclassified information shared by the DoD with contractors and subcontractors.</p>
<p>With the release of the CMMC final rule, DoD contractors can begin to assess and align their controls and processes to be compliant with CMMC’s requirements.</p>
<p>This article explains how GitLab customers can leverage the GitLab platform to help satisfy relevant NIST SP 800-171 R2 requirements to achieve CMMC Level 2 compliance.</p>

		<p>In a team environment, it’s all about playing nice with others. The same could be said of your technology team (or stack), and its various components. The problem of disparate, complex systems – each coming from disparate, complex places – all being thrown together in an enterprise has been one the industry has been mulling over for some time. Any change to an individual service could have repercussions across the whole suite, and interconnected issues like these continue to perplex and overwhelm practitioners. With Tripwire Enterprise Integration Framework (TEIF), Fortra’s Tripwire offers&hellip;</p>

		<p>Valve will be releasing a beta of SteamOS that you can install on your devices, and it&rsquo;s coming soon.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is well underway, and one surprise that came from the show was confirmation from Valve that the company wants SteamOS to run on everything. It&rsquo;s been <em>kind of</em> expected for a while, but a direct confirmation of it along with a promise for more devices to come with it isn&rsquo;t necessarily something most people had on their bingo cards for the show. What it means is that you&rsquo;ll be able to install SteamOS on your PC or your gaming handheld, without a need to worry about dealing with Windows.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering if you should upgrade your graphics card, you should see these signs that it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The graphics card on your PC does all the heavy lifting when you play your favorite games. Therefore, it&rsquo;s one of the first components you should consider upgrading to improve your PC&rsquo;s gaming performance. Unlike smartphones, though, most users don&rsquo;t upgrade their PCs every two years or so. In fact, I try to hold on to my graphics card for as long as I can. But how do you know when it&rsquo;s time to get a new one? Look out for these signs.</p>

		<p>Reflecting on 2024, it has been an eventful year for the Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting team. Throughout the year, we identified numerous threat actor campaigns exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, uncovered additional variants of these vulnerabilities, and discovered even more vulnerabilities through our in-the-wild research. In this blog, we will highlight some of the key achievements of the Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting team, as well as discuss important in-the-wild vulnerability trends and industry challenges we encountered in 2024 which will continue into 2025</p>

<h2 id="-about">🤗 About</h2>
<p>2024 was an incredible year filled with challenges, achievements, and an abundance of - sometimes unexpected - <strong>learning opportunities that came to me on my way.</strong></p>
<p>Reflecting on the year, here are <strong>some of the highlights</strong> that shaped my growth as a professional and as a person.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed the most this year is the fact that <strong>I could transform real life problems into nicely well packaged IT projects</strong> that could satisfy my own curiosity and then be shared with the community.</p>
