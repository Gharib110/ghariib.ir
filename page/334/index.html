		<p>Automation of the web is now an indispensable tool in modern software development and testing. In this comprehensive Selenium Python tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to build a robust web automation framework capable of handling real-world scenarios. If you are interested in implementing automated testing in Python or creating complex web scraping automation solutions, this guide will give you industry-tested approaches and Selenium best practices.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-web-automation-fundamentals">Understanding Web Automation Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Web automation is vital in modern software development, testing, and data collection. Its applications span from end-to-end testing of web applications to simplifying repetitive workflows, such as form submissions or web scraping. While Selenium WebDriver Python integration offers powerful capabilities, robust web automation is more than just writing scripts to mimic user interactions. Itâ€™s about designing workflows and frameworks that are maintainable, adaptable, and resilient to changes to the target web application.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Laptop GPUs are, for the most part, not upgradeable. But there are some exceptions and workarounds.</p>
<p>Some of the best laptops available today feature a dedicated (sometimes called discrete) graphics card (GPU) that can deliver much more performance than integrated processor (CPU) graphics. You&rsquo;ll find a discrete GPU in the majority of high-end gaming laptops and laptops aimed at creators, such as the Surface Laptop Studio 2. These GPUs certainly add power to the laptop, but can you upgrade them in the future if you need more power?</p>
