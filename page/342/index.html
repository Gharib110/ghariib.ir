<p>Let’s get it straight: it is wrong to have more than one application container inside a single Pod. There are different reasons behind this statement and I will mention just a few of them. In any cases, the way Kubernetes has been designed brings us to the fact that having just one application container per Pod gives us a lot more flexibility.</p>

		<p>Generative AI is critical to unleashing the potential of all teams, and we’re excited to use this revolutionary technology to improve the way teams work. A year ago, we launched Atlassian Intelligence to help teams boost productivity with AI.</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve turned our attention to using AI to solve the highly complex problem of enterprise search and knowledge discovery. Our goal is to enable you to turn Atlassian and third-party data from across your organization into actionable insights and knowledge-driven decisions. In this age of generative AI, every team member deserves to have superpowers, and we want to make sure we deliver them.</p>

<p>The advent of agile methodologies has certainly been a phenomenon similar to the revolution of the 1960s. I believe that it’s some sort of Woodstock of information, which, as often happens in life, I only saw from afar.</p>
<p>However, I continue to meet people who were there and who always stop to tell me that such an event will never happen again <strong>and how the programmers of the past loved each other</strong>, exchanged flower crowns, etc. Well, in short, the Robert Downey Jr. meme fits perfectly.</p>

		<p>We’re excited to announce the ability to use Entra profile information in Azure DevOps. This has been a long-standing feature request from the community (ex. profile, picture, email, and name). Beyond the convenience of configuring profile information in one place and ensuring the accuracy of personal information, using Entra profile information in Azure DevOps provides important security and compliance benefits for Enterprise customers.</p>
<p>Today we encourage users in Entra backed organizations to turn on <strong>Entra Profile information</strong> in Preview Features. When you do, your Azure DevOps profile will become read-only, and information will be populated from Entra instead.</p>

<p>Obsidian has exploded in popularity as a powerful knowledge base and note-taking tool. But let’s be honest, the out-of-the-box settings aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. Obsidian can feel a bit bland and underwhelming with the default settings. Instead of settling with it, go through these simple tweaks to instantly elevate your Obsidian experience.</p>

	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hey there! If you’ve been spending any time around technology, coding, or even just browsing the web, you’ve probably come across the term “API.” But, let’s be real for a moment—what exactly is an API? What does it do, and why should you care? Don&rsquo;t worry, I’m here to help you understand it in a super easy way.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-an-api">What Exactly is an API?</h2>
<p>To break it down, an API (Application Programming Interface) is basically a way for one piece of software or application to communicate with another. Think of it as a waiter at a restaurant. The waiter takes your order (request), passes it to the kitchen (the system that processes the request), and then brings you the food (response). APIs do the same thing, but with data between software systems instead of food!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cloudops">What Is CloudOps? </h2>
<p>CloudOps, or Cloud Operations, is a model for managing and delivering cloud-based services in a reliable, efficient, and scalable manner. It’s a set of <strong>best practices, principles, and tools</strong> that ensure the smooth functioning of cloud-based platforms and applications. It transcends the traditional boundaries of IT operations, encompassing aspects like automation, monitoring, security, and compliance, thereby providing a holistic approach to cloud management.</p>

<p>Event streaming is a powerful data processing paradigm where events—small, immutable pieces of data—are continuously produced, captured, and processed in real time. Apache Kafka, an open-source distributed event streaming platform, has become the go-to solution for implementing event streaming in modern systems.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-events-and-streams">Understanding Events and Streams</h2>
<p>An <strong>event</strong> is a record of an occurrence, such as a user clicking a button, a temperature sensor reporting a reading, or an e-commerce platform logging a purchase. These events are ingested and stored in Kafka as messages.<br>
A <strong>stream</strong> is an unbounded sequence of these events, organized into <strong>topics</strong> in Kafka. Each topic serves as a logical channel for related events (e.g., a topic for user activity logs or financial transactions).</p>
