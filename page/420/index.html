<p>Good news, everyone! We’ve already got some discounted room blocks you can use to lock down your lodgings for DEF CON 33.</p>
<p>DC33 doesn’t kick off until August 7, 2025, but that’s no reason to lollygag. If you’re a high-octane go-getter you already know how good it feels to get those To-Do items checked off early. If not, this is far enough ahead to forget you booked and give yourself a nice surprise when there’s one less thing to do at crunch time.</p>

<p>As OT environments become more interconnected, organizations can manage operations remotely, enhancing efficiency and enabling greater oversight even from a distance. However, these advancements come with heightened security risks. A recent report from Palo Alto Networks and ABI Research found that 74% of respondents noticed an increase in remote access, creating more entry points for attackers. This expanded attack surface has made OT systems a prime target for cyber threats, underscoring the need for a robust security framework tailored to remote OT environments.</p>
