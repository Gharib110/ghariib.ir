		<p>The offices where Washington D.C.’s bureaucrats work were largely empty on Monday, January 20, 2025, as Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. President for the second time.</p>
<p>But they weren’t empty for the inauguration. Because that Monday coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day federal holiday, most U.S. government employees had a paid day off work.</p>
<p>But then, many of the federal government’s buildings continued to sit empty on Tuesday, January 21, and again on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.</p>

		<p>Businesses are facing a significant challenge – security fragmentation and complexity are getting in the way of results. The IBM Institute for Business Value in collaboration with Palo Alto Networks conducted the study, <em>Capturing the cybersecurity dividend: how security platforms generate business value</em>. The research found 52% of surveyed executives identified complexity as the biggest impediment to their security operations. With the average organization managing 83 different security solutions from 29 vendors, the struggle to keep security operations streamlined and effective is real.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The Azure DevOps Demo Generator is a tool that allows you to create projects in your Azure DevOps organization, complete with pre-filled sample content. This includes source code, work items, iterations, service connections, and build and release pipelines, all based on a template you select.</p>
<p>Starting <strong>February 28, 2025</strong>, we are eliminating the need for us to authenticate on your behalf. This update will give you greater control over creating new projects and ensure a more secure process. Instead of the previous authentication process, you will run the ADOGenerator project as a console application or executable (.exe) file to create projects in your Azure DevOps organization.</p>

		<p>Learn how to protect against the abuse of AWS Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) in ransomware campaigns.</p>
<p>Ransomware actors are increasingly abusing native cloud features to target critical data. A recent threat actor campaign, as detailed in the Halcyon blog, was observed abusing Amazon Web Services (AWS) Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). By encrypting S3 objects with their own keys, attackers render data irretrievable, abusing AWS features and services through the use of stolen credentials in an attempt to simplify their efforts with less infrastructure to manage.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Cloudflare proudly leads the way with our approach to data privacy and the protection of personal information, and we’ve been an ardent supporter of the need for the free flow of data across jurisdictional borders. So today, on Data Privacy Day (also known internationally as Data Protection Day), we’re happy to announce that we’re adding our fourth and fifth privacy validations, and this time, they are global firsts! Cloudflare is the first organisation to announce that we have been successfully audited against the brand new Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (Global CBPRs) for data controllers and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (Global PRP). These validations demonstrate our support and adherence to global standards that provide for privacy-respecting data flows across jurisdictions. Organizations that have been successfully audited will be formally certified when the certifications officially launch, which we expect to happen later in 2025. </p>

		<p>January 27 marks the International Holocaust Remembrance Day — a solemn occasion to honor the memory of the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, along with countless others who fell victim to the Nazi regime&rsquo;s campaign of hatred and intolerance. This tragic chapter in human history serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of prejudice and extremism. </p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau —  as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This year, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of this infamous extermination camp.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Cloudflare revealed how its data pipeline has achieved unprecedented scalability, processing up to 706 million events per second as of December 2024 representing a staggering 100x growth since 2018.</p>
<p>This massive data flow, which peaks at 107 GiB/s of compressed data, powers the company’s core services, including Logs, Analytics, billing, and machine learning models for bot detection.</p>
<p>To navigate the challenges of managing such an immense volume of information, Cloudflare employs innovative downsampling and adaptive sampling techniques to ensure efficient data processing without compromising usability.</p>
