<p>AWS identified <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0851">CVE-2025-0851</a>, a path traversal issue in ZipUtils.unzip and TarUtils.untar in Deep Java Library (DJL) on all platforms that allows a bad actor to write files to arbitrary locations. If leveraged, an actor could gain SSH access by injecting an SSH key into the authorized_keys file, or upload HTML files to leverage cross-site scripting issues. We can confirm that this issue has not been leveraged. A fix for this issue has been released and we recommend the users of <a href="https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl">DJL</a> upgrade to version 0.31.1 or later.</p>
