		<p>It was a cold and wet Thursday morning, sometime in early 2006. There I was sitting at the very top back row of an awe-inspiring lecture theatre inside Royal Holloway&rsquo;s Founder’s Building in Egham, Surrey (UK) while studying for my MSc in Information Security. Back then, the lecture in progress was from the software security module.</p>

<p>As companies continue to integrate their operational technology (OT) and IT environments, they’re coming to grips with the fact that this move opens them up to new avenues for cyber threats.</p>

</p>
<p>More than 3 years ago now, Scott Helme and I launched a little project called Why No HTTPS? It listed the world&rsquo;s largest websites that didn&rsquo;t properly redirect insecure requests to secure ones. We updated it December before last and pleasingly, noted that more websites than ever were doing the right thing and forcing browsers down the secure path. That&rsquo;s the good news, the bad news is that there are still some really wacky, unexplainable anti-HTTPS views out there, but those voices are increasingly less relevant as the browsers march forward:</p>

		<p>For over 15 years, YARA has been growing and evolving until it became an indispensable tool in every malware researcher&rsquo;s toolbox. Throughout this time YARA has seen numerous updates, with new features added and countless bugs fixed. But today, I&rsquo;m excited to announce the biggest change yet: a full rewrite.</p>
<p>YARA-X is a completely new implementation of YARA in Rust, and it has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Better user experience</strong>: The new command-line interface is more modern and colorful, and error reports are now more explicative. More features aimed at improving the user&rsquo;s experience will be incorporated in the future.</p>

		<p>It requires minimal additional materials, too.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi cases are a great way to ensure your SBC isn&rsquo;t sitting around, exposed to the elements. However, just because they&rsquo;re practical doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to be boring. We&rsquo;ve seen plenty of 3D-printed Raspberry Pi cases in the past, but this one is especially notable as an excellent addition for anyone using their SBC as a retro console.</p>

		<p>AT&amp;T recently faced a significant cybersecurity breach involving its Snowflake account, leading to the company allegedly paying a ransom to prevent further data leakage. According to various reports, the telecommunications giant paid approximately $370,000 to the hacking group ShinyHunters to delete the stolen data. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges and risks large corporations face in protecting sensitive customer information in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<h3 id="details-of-the-breach">Details of the Breach</h3>
<p>The breach was reportedly carried out by ShinyHunters, a notorious hacking group known for its previous cyber-attacks on various companies. The hackers gained access to AT&amp;T’s Snowflake account, a cloud-based data warehousing service, and managed to exfiltrate sensitive customer data, including call logs and personal information. Following the breach, the hackers demanded a ransom for the deletion of the stolen data.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 7 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The UpdraftPlus: WP Backup &amp; Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.24.11 via deserialization of untrusted input in the &lsquo;recursive_unserialized_replace&rsquo; function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>
