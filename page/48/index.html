<p>“If Global Cybercrime Inc. traded on a stock exchange, I would buy it because its growth trajectory over the past decade has been breathtaking,” writes Steven Ellliott, an executive at ADAMnetworks. “Measured by GDP, global cybercrime is now a $10.5 trillion-per-year economy, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, trailing only the U.S. and China in economic productivity.”</p>

<p>As operational technology (OT) environments rapidly evolve, security strategies must keep pace with emerging risks and operational challenges. The modernization of OT calls for a fresh approach that goes beyond asset visibility to ensure resilience, safety and uptime. Protecting industrial infrastructure, especially environments with legacy systems, distributed operations and remote workforces, requires security strategies that address real-world threats, adapt to operational constraints, and support long-term reliability.</p>

		<p>Accessing private content online, whether it&rsquo;s checking email or streaming your favorite show, almost always starts with a “login” step. Beneath this everyday task lies a widespread human mistake we still have not resolved: <strong>password reuse.</strong> Many users recycle passwords across multiple services, creating a ripple effect of risk when their credentials are leaked.</p>
<p>Based on Cloudflare&rsquo;s observed traffic between September - November 2024, <strong>41% of successful logins across websites protected by Cloudflare involve compromised passwords.</strong> In this post, we’ll explore the widespread impact of password reuse, focusing on how it affects popular Content Management Systems (CMS), the behavior of bots versus humans in login attempts, and how attackers exploit stolen credentials to take over accounts at scale.</p>

		<p>Recently, when my workplace laptop needed a hardware refresh and I wanted to replace it with an ARM-based laptop with Linux (a MacBook), I was tasked with comparing the efficiency of using CPU virtualization versus emulation.This article presents my research and benchmark data comparing the performance and power consumption of workloads running under virtualization and emulation.We live in exciting times: After many years with the x86 architecture dominating the market, there are new players. For some years, Amazon has been offering Graviton instances, which consists of using an ARM-based CPU</p>

		<p>Job Posting: <strong>Ph.D. position in Hardware Security (Verification)</strong><br>
<em>Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany</em></p>
<p>The newly established junior research group on <em>Computer-Aided Verification of Physical Security Properties (CAVE)</em> is looking for excellent Ph.D. candidates in the area of hardware security, particularly (but not limited to) those specialized in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware Security Verification: We explore how to perform efficient pre-silicon security verification with respect to physical implementation attacks (Side-Channel Analysis / Fault-Injection Analysis).</li>
<li>Physical Implementation Attacks: We deepen the (theoretical) understanding of active and passive physical implementation attacks to build formal attacker models for security verification.</li>
<li>Secure Hardware Design: We investigate how to build secure hardware circuits that can resist physical implementation attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in applying, please send an email to Dr. Pascal Sasdrich (<a href="mailto:pascal.sasdrich@rub.de">pascal.sasdrich@rub.de</a>) with the following documents in a single PDF (max. 10 MB) and subject line &ldquo;[CAVE] Application for PhD position&rdquo;:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Starting in December 2024, leading up to some of the busiest travel days, Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified a phishing campaign that impersonates online travel agency Booking.com and targets organizations in the hospitality industry. The campaign uses a social engineering technique called ClickFix to deliver multiple credential-stealing malware in order to conduct financial fraud and theft. As of February 2025, this campaign is ongoing.</p>
<p>This phishing attack specifically targets individuals in hospitality organizations in North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe, that are most likely to work with Booking.com, sending fake emails purporting to be coming from the agency.</p>

<p>To help users switching from Adobe PhotoShop, PhotoGIMP project updated today with support for the new GIMP 3.0 image editor.</p>
<p>PhotoGIMP is a free open-source project that optimizes GIMP for AdobeShop users. By changing the local app data, it organised the tools and their options to be PhotoShop style, assigned keyboard shortcuts to similar to the ones in Photoshop for Windows, following Adobe’s Documentation, and added new default settings to maximize space on the canvas.</p>
