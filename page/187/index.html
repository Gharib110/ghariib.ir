<p>Cyber criminals continue to refine their phishing tactics, targeting trusted global brands to deceive users and steal sensitive information. Check Point Research (CPR), the intelligence arm of Check Point® Software, has unveiled its latest findings for Q4 2024, revealing key trends in brand phishing attacks. Technology Sector Leads in Phishing Attempts Microsoft retained its dominance as the most imitated brand in phishing schemes, accounting for a staggering 32% of all attempts. Apple followed with 12%, while Google ranked third. Notably, LinkedIn reentered the list at fourth place, emphasizing the persistent targeting of technology and Social Network brands. The persistence of […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Fast, private and regulated payments in asynchronous networks</strong><br>
<em>Maxence Brugeres, Victor Languille, Petr Kuznetsov, Hamza Zarfaoui</em></p>
<p>We propose a decentralized asset-transfer system that enjoys full privacy: no party can learn the details of a transaction, except for its issuer and its recipient. Furthermore, the recipient is only aware of the amount of the transaction. Our system does not rely on consensus or synchrony assumptions, and therefore, it is responsive, since it runs at the actual network speed. Under the hood, every transaction creates a consumable coin equipped with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK) that confirms that the issuer has sufficient funds without revealing any information about her identity, the recipient&rsquo;s identity, or the payment amount. Moreover, we equip our system with a regulatory enforcement mechanism that can be used to regulate transfer limits or restrict specific addresses from sending or receiving funds, while preserving the system&rsquo;s privacy guarantees. Finally, we report on Paxpay, our implementation of Fully Private Asset Transfer (FPAT) that uses the Gnark library for the NIZKs. In our benchmark, Paxpay exhibits better performance than earlier proposals that either ensure only partial privacy, require some kind of network synchrony or do not implement regulation features. Our system thus reconciles privacy, responsiveness, regulation enforcement and performance.</p>

<p>The Alabama Community College System in partnership with Advantage Consulting &amp; Solutions is set to debut its inaugural class of the Alabama Cybersecurity Fellowship. Funded by Innovate Alabama, the program aims to address the growing cybersecurity talent gap in Alabama. According to Cybersecurity Ventures data cited by Forbes, there are nearly 750,000 job vacancies across the U.S.</p>

		<p>Over the years, Find Security Bugs <em>– or FindSecBugs in short –</em> has evolved from a limited static-analysis tool to one with solid coverage of bug patterns. In this post, we will present the latest milestone from the project: arrival in the OWASP family, some figures and details regarding its new release.</p>

<p>The main motivation for joining the OWASP foundation is to make it clear that the project is a community effort. While GoSecure is using the tool internally for code review assessments, it does not plan to commercialize this specific product. Under the OWASP umbrella, it should be clear to the future contributors that the project is not owned by a single organization or author.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Friendly primes for efficient modular arithmetic using the Polynomial Modular Number System</strong><br>
<em>Fangan Yssouf Dosso, Nadia El Mrabet, Nicolas Méloni, François Palma, Pascal Véron</em></p>
<p>The Polynomial Modular Number System (PMNS) is a non-positional number system designed for modular arithmetic. Its efficiency, both in software and hardware, has been demonstrated for integers commonly used in Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In recent papers, some authors introduce specific prime forms that are particularly well-suited for PMNS arithmetic. In this work, we extend their results to a broader class of prime numbers. In practice, our approach yields performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, Pseudo-Mersenne arithmetic. As a result, we expand the set of prime numbers that are well-suited for modular arithmetic. Furthermore, we contribute a database of proof of concept Elliptic Curves constructed with those primes that verify the Brainpool Standard.</p>

		<p>Security Operations Center ( SOC) analysts have it rough. Modern security tools generate an extraordinary number of alerts, attackers are more sophisticated than ever, and IT infrastructures are unprecedentedly complex. As a result, analysts are overwhelmed with workload and alerts, making it near-impossible to make intelligent, informed decisions. Fortunately, artificial intelligence ( AI) is helping to ease the strain. Let’s look at how. Better Allocated Resources As noted, modern SOC analysts must deal with a barrage of security alerts.

<p>Inauguration Day has come and gone, and the peaceful transfer of power couldn’t have happened without the intricate systems that ensure the integrity of the electoral process—specifically, cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a vast network of digital defenses worked to protect elections from disinformation, cyberattacks, and manipulation, all of which pose increasing threats in today’s digital age. From securing ballots to combating deepfakes, these measures play a critical role in upholding trust in democracy and making days like Inauguration Day possible.</p>
