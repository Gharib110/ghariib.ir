	<div>
		<p>Small businesses may think they don’t need to implement cybersecurity training programs because larger enterprises with more revenue are more profitable for bad actors. However, small businesses lacking essential security measures are prime targets due to the ease of access and fewer resources for investigation and remediation. While cybersecurity solutions can be an indispensable part of a robust cybersecurity strategy, it is crucial for even small organizations to prioritize user security awareness training (SAT) alongside these tools. According to a recent Cyber Risk Report published by IT&hellip;</p>

<p>Identity theft is a growing concern, and Data Privacy Week serves as an important reminder to safeguard your personal information. In today’s digital age, scammers have more tools than ever to steal your identity, often with just a few key details—like your Social Security number, bank account information, or home address.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, identity theft claims have surged in recent years, jumping from approximately 650,000 in 2019 to over a million in 2023, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This trend underscores the urgent need for stronger personal data protection habits.</p>

		<p>The dangerous Banshee stealer for Macs has learned how to bypass built-in macOS security, and continues to evolve. How to protect yourself?</p>
<p>Many macOS users believe their operating system is immune to malware, so they don’t need to take extra security precautions. In reality, it’s far from the truth, and new threats keep popping up.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-viruses-for-macos">Are there viruses for macOS?</h2>
<p>Yes — and plenty of ’em. Here are some examples of Mac malware we’ve previously covered on Kaspersky Daily and Securelist:</p>

<p>This is a step by step beginner’s guide shows how to configure Nginx to block certain IPs or IP range from accessing your website, and block all others while only you (and specified IPs) can access the wordpress login pages.</p>
<p>This site was under attack a few days ago. Someone made tens of thousands of constant requests that slowed down the server response. And, here’s what I did to manually block attacker’s IPs and restrict access to the login page.</p>

		<p>Taking a coordinated security approach is one way to leave no loopholes. By this, we are referring to a cybersecurity architecture that comprises a team and security components working together in sync to provide more effective security operations as opposed to the usual fragmented approach, which often leaves businesses without a coordinated response to threats. &hellip;</p>

		<p>GCC 15 is expected to be released in April or May 2025. To speed up compilation, consider using the <code>#embed</code> directive for programs which need to include larger binary data. Even programs using large array initializers may encounter nice compilation time speedups when using the new GCC version. This article discusses the inclusion of binary data in C as well as <code>#embed</code> implementation in GCC 15.</p>
<h2 id="4-methods-to-add-binary-data">4 methods to add binary data</h2>
<p>Various C/C++ programs need to include binary data in their binaries or shared libraries. There have been ways to achieve this with a few drawbacks.</p>
