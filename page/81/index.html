		<p>These tools help me monitor and manage my hardware easily and effectively</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools you can use to improve your Windows experience, from customizing your desktop to optimizing the performance of your PC. But what if you want to take a closer look at your hardware components and change certain settings or features? I&rsquo;ve found that Windows doesn&rsquo;t give me the level of control I would like, but there are plenty of free apps available that do.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Strong, wide-reaching regulation can bring safety to communities – but it can also bring uncertainty. The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA, or just CRA for short) has proven no exception to this universal rule. Across the open source community and the wider tech landscape, people have been greeting the news with the whole spectrum of reactions: concern, anxiety, hope. </p>
<p>But is there anything to fear? Does the CRA really change things in open source? And how should your teams be preparing for this legislation? In this article, I’ll dive into the CRA and explain its aims, requirements, and effects on the open source community, and give my cybersecurity recommendations to prepare for the CRA.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Most people know that robots no longer sound like tinny trash cans. They sound like Siri, Alexa, and Gemini. They sound like the voices in labyrinthine customer support phone trees. And even those robot voices are being made obsolete by new AI-generated voices that can mimic every vocal nuance and tic of human speech, down to specific regional accents. And with just a few seconds of audio, AI can now clone someone’s specific voice.</p>

		<p>Can anyone blame him, though?</p>
<p>Back in December 2024, we saw the then-CEO of Intel Pat Gelsinger step down from his position. Intel was on a pretty bad streak of luck at the time, which only just turned around after the company saw success with its Battlemage GPUs. Well, it seems one person had his back at least, as Bill Gates said he had some faith in him during a recent interview.</p>

<p>For the third consecutive year, Check Point ranked #1 for security effectiveness in all categories of the Miercom Enterprise and Hybrid Mesh Firewall Report. This report includes two new metrics: SSE/SASE Threat Prevention and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs). Miercom’s independent, head-to-head stress testing establishes how well a platform can detect and block the latest generations of cyber security threats in real-world scenarios. Blocking at least 99% of cyber attacks is a key objective, because even a 90% block rate can translate to hundreds of costly attacks. Organizations subject to these attacks can face data loss, credential theft, ransomware demands, and […]</p>

		<p>Interesting analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project (source for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.</p>
<p>We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em> AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions&hellip;</p>

		<p>Picture this: Product and Development teams are working in isolation. Product has created a 12-month roadmap and communicated it to internal stakeholders but didn&rsquo;t review it with their development team. Dev starts building the features planned for the upcoming sprint without considering the broader product roadmap, leading to missed opportunities to optimize timing, like running projects in parallel, accounting for team capacity, or building reusable APIs that could serve multiple initiatives. The lack of coordination results in inefficiencies and delayed value delivery.</p>

		<p>Secrets left exposed in outdated repositories pose significant risk for data breaches. For example, a still-active secret key can be exposed, leaving it vulnerable to exploitation. Secrets include access keys, API tokens, private keys, and other sensitive values.</p>
<p>In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use GitLab Secret Detection to scan a repository’s full commit history, including all branches, to detect sensitive secrets. In addition, you will discover how to view the results directly within the GitLab UI without the need for any integration. All it takes is just a couple of lines of code in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> pipeline file.</p>
