<h2 id="plain-english-explanation">Plain English Explanation</h2>
<p>Scientists have found that when AI language models make things up (hallucinate), it might actually help discover new drugs. Think of it like brainstorming - sometimes wild ideas lead to useful innovations.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>dCTIDH: Fast &amp; Deterministic CTIDH</strong><br>
<em>Fabio Campos, Andreas Hellenbrand, Michael Meyer, Krijn Reijnders</em></p>
<p>This paper presents dCTIDH, a CSIDH implementation that combines two recent developments into a novel state-of-the-art deterministic implementation. We combine the approach of deterministic variants of CSIDH with the batching strategy of CTIDH, which shows that the full potential of this key space has not yet been explored. This high-level adjustment in itself leads to a significant speed-up. To achieve an effective deterministic evaluation in constant time, we introduce Wombats, a new approach to performing isogenies in batches, specifically tailored to the behavior required for deterministic CSIDH using CTIDH batching.</p>

<p>Docking stations can be a great way to expand the capabilities of the devices you already own. While docking stations are usually paired up with laptops, you can also use them for tablets, PC gaming handhelds, and smartphones as well. Of course, if you&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for one, chances are, you&rsquo;ve seen how pricey they can be.</p>

		<p>Be careful where you click.</p>
<p>A few years ago, it became a &ldquo;life hack&rdquo; to add the word &ldquo;Reddit&rdquo; at the end of a search term for something you want help with (at least, before Google began serving Reddit posts higher than usual). The idea is that whatever problem you have, there are ten Reddit threads from days past that have threads full of troubleshooting tips, advice, solutions, and tools to fix your issue. Well, it seems that the life hack is being used against us, as scammers now use fake Reddit websites to peddle malware.</p>

<p>The first alpha release of GNOME 48 is out today! See what’s new in the desktop environment that will be default in next Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42.</p>
<p>First, GNOME 48 introduced <strong>new core app called Decibels</strong>. It’s a simple audio player that features playback speed adjustment, easy seek controls, and hows the waveform of the track.</p>

<p>To promote healthier habits and/or parental control, the new release introduced <strong>initial screen time limits</strong> support! It added initial <strong>Wellbeing panel</strong> in GNOME Control Center (aka Settings), allowing to view screen time usage on the device and set daily time limits. However, the feature is disabled by default!</p>

		<p>With a new drag-and-drop feature, Microsoft wants to make sharing files hassle-free for Windows 11 users.</p>
<p>When Windows 11 debuted back in 2021, people had mixed feelings about it, because while the design was refreshing, useful features like the drag-and-drop items on the taskbar were missing, leading to outrage. The taskbar drag-and-drop and other missing features were reintroduced to Windows 11 in the 22H2 update. Now, after more than two years, the software giant is once again rolling up its sleeves to take the drag-and-drop to the next level to make sharing effortless.</p>
