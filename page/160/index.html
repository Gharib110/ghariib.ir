		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>NTRU+Sign: Compact NTRU-Based Signatures Using Bimodal Distributions</strong><br>
<em>Joo Woo, Jonghyun Kim, Ga Hee Hong, Seungwoo Lee, Minkyu Kim, Hochang Lee, Jong Hwan Park</em></p>
<p>We present a new lattice-based signature scheme, called ‘NTRU+Sign’, using the Fiat-Shamir with Aborts framework. The proposed scheme is designed based on a novel NTRU-based key structure that fits well with bimodal distributions, enabling efficiency improvements compared to its predecessor, BLISS. The novel NTRU-based key structure is characterized by: (1) effectively changing a modulus from 2q to q, which is different from the existing usage of 2q for bimodal distributions, and (2) drastically reducing the magnitude of a secret key, which directly leads to compactness of signature sizes. We provide two concrete parameter sets for NTRU+Sign, supporting 93-bit and 211-bit security levels. Using the technique from GALACTICS (that was suggested as the constant-time implementation of BLISS), our analysis shows that NTRU+Sign achieves a good balance between computational efficiency and signature compactness, with constant-time implementation. For instance, at the NIST-3 security level, NTRU+Sign produces signatures that are significantly smaller than Dilithium and HAETAE, while providing faster verification speeds. These advantages position NTRU+Sign as a competitive and practical solution for real-world deployments.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the structure of the Schur squares of Twisted Generalized Reed-Solomon codes and application to cryptanalysis</strong><br>
<em>Alain Couvreur, Rakhi Pratihar, Nihan Tanisali, Ilaria Zappatore</em></p>
<p>Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes constitute an interesting family of evaluation codes, containing a large class of maximum distance separable codes non-equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) ones. Moreover, the Schur squares of TGRS codes may be much larger than those of GRS codes with same dimension. Exploiting these structural differences, in 2018, Beelen, Bossert, Puchinger and Rosenkilde proposed a subfamily of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) Twisted Reed&ndash;Solomon (TRS) codes over $mathbb{F}_q$ with $ell$ twists $q approx n^{2^{ell}}$ for McEliece encryption, claiming their resistance to both Sidelnikov Shestakov attack and Schur products&ndash;based attacks. In short, they claimed these codes to resist to classical key recovery attacks on McEliece encryption scheme instantiated with Reed-Solomon (RS) or GRS codes. In 2020, Lavauzelle and Renner presented an original attack on this system based on the computation of the subfield subcode of the public TRS code.</p>

		<p>When a user creates a new account by signing up, the password they provide is not stored directly in the database. Instead, the password is passed through a hash function. This hash function converts the original password into a unique string (hash). The hash value is then stored in the server, not the actual password.</p>
<p>Later, when the user attempts to log in, they enter the same password. This entered password is passed through the same hash function, and the resulting hash is compared with the hash stored in the server. If both hash values match, it indicates that the password entered by the user is correct. This is because hash functions always generate the same output for the same input, ensuring consistency. If the hash values do not match, the login will be rejected.</p>

<p>The campaign is unique for its focus on the Chinese-speaking demographic and the use of software-related lures to activate the attack chain.</p>
<p>“Equally striking is the attackers’ sophisticated use of legitimate software as a delivery mechanism for malware, seamlessly blending malicious activities with seemingly benign applications,” Fishbein said.</p>
<p>“The adaptability of the PNGPlug loader further elevates the threat, as its modular design allows it to be tailored for multiple campaigns.”</p>
