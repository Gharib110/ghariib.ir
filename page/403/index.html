	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would prohibit data brokers from selling or transferring location and health data.</p>
<p>Data brokers have drawn attention this year by leaking several large databases, with the worst being the National Public Data leak. The data breach made international headlines because it affected hundreds of millions of people, and it included Social Security Numbers.</p>
<p>All this when data brokers had already been faced with reforms in the shape of the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA). Hwoever, APRA is not expected to pass before Congress wraps up for the year, and some lawmakers feel the need for extra data regulations.</p>

<p>DEF CON thrives on community collaboration and has operated for over 30 years successfully working with hundreds of vendors including the dozens that have helped with our badges over the years. For this year’s Raspberry Pi badges, DEF CON hired Entropic Engineering to do the hardware development and firmware. After going overbudget by more than 60%, several bad-faith charges, and with a product still in preproduction, DEF CON issued a stop work order. Any claims that DEF CON did not pay Entropic Engineering for its hardware or firmware development are false. Unfortunately, we heard that these issues with Entropic Engineering were not unique to DEF CON. We decided at that point to finish the badge on our own. We paid to send engineers to Vietnam to work onsite to finalize and test the badges in order to ensure they would be done on time for the conference. We never removed Entropic Engineering’s logo from our badge, it is still on the PCB. However, Entropic was not involved in the design and production of the case, and we removed their logo we had added as a courtesy.</p>

		<p><strong>Dell Technologies,</strong> together with <strong>Wind River</strong> (owned by Intel and Delphi Automotive), is introducing a new telecom cloud infrastructure solution to help communications service providers (CSPs) reduce complexity and accelerate their “<strong>cloud-native”</strong> network deployments.</p>
<p>To facilitate these solutions, <strong>Dell’s telecom partner certification program</strong> simplifies the process for technology partners to validate and integrate their products within a rapidly growing open technology ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks</strong> help accelerate open, cloud-native network deployments.  Dell is taking an entirely new approach to solve the complexities of cloud-native network deployments with Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks. The fully engineered, cloud-native infrastructure blocks simplify telecom cloud network deployment and management, while accelerating the introduction of new technologies and lowering operational expenses (OpEX).</p>
