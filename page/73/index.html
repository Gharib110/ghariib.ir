<p>The use of ChatGPT has led to a decrease in human-generated content with people asking and answering fewer questions online, according to new research from Corvinus University of Budapest.</p>
<p>Content and discussions online are used by people to learn new things and solve problems, and essential for training AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Johannes Wachs, Associate Professor at Corvinus University, and colleagues from UCL and LMU Munich investigated the impact of ChatGPT on the generation of open data on Stack Overflow, an online Q&amp;A platform for computer programmers and an essential source of training data for LLMs.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Always by Your Side: Constructing Traceable Anonymous Credentials with Hardware-Binding</strong><br>
<em>Chang Chen, Guoyu Yang, Qi Chen, Wei Wang, Jin Li</em></p>
<p>With the development of decentralized identity (DID), anonymous credential (AC) technology, as well as its traceability, is receiving more and more attention. Most works introduce a trusted party (regulator) that holds a decryption key or backdoor to directly deanonymize the user identity of anonymous authentication. While some cryptographic primitives can help regulators handle complex tracing tasks among large amounts of user profiles (stored by the issuer) and authentication records (stored by the service provider), additional security primitives are still needed to ensure the privacy of other users. Besides, hardware-binding anonymous credential (hbAC) systems have been proposed to prevent credential sharing or address platform resource constraints, the traceability of hbAC has yet to be discussed.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>AWS launched AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) in August 2011 with a single global endpoint <code>(https://sts.amazonaws.com)</code>, hosted in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. To reduce dependency on a single Region, STS launched AWS STS Regional endpoints (<code>https://sts.{Region_identifier}.{partition_domain}</code>) in February 2015. These Regional endpoints allow you to use STS in the same Region as your workloads, which improves both performance and reliability.</p>
<p>However, many customers and third-party tools continue to call the STS global endpoint, and as a result, these customers don’t get the benefits of STS Regional endpoints. To help improve the resiliency and performance of your applications, we are making changes to the STS global endpoint, with no action required from customers. These changes will be released in the coming weeks.</p>

		<p>Apple has released a host of security updates across many devices, including for a zero-day bug which is being actively exploited in iOS.</p>
<p>Apple said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Devices affected are those that run:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>iPhone XS and later</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Asynchronous YOSO a la Paillier</strong><br>
<em>Ivan Bjerre Damgård, Simon Holmgaard Kamp, Julian Loss, Jesper Buus Nielsen</em></p>
<p>We present the first complete asynchronous MPC protocols for the YOSO (You Speak Only Once) setting. Our protocols rely on threshold additively homomorphic Paillier encryption and are adaptively secure. We rely on the paradigm of Blum et al. (TCC `20) in order to recursively refresh the setup needed for running future steps of YOSO MPC, but replace any use of heavy primitives such as threshold fully homomorphic encryption in their protocol with more efficient alternatives. In order to obtain an efficient YOSO MPC protocol, we also revisit the consensus layer upon which our protocol is built. To this end, we present a novel total-order broadcast protocol with subquadratic communication complexity in the total number $M$ of parties in the network and whose complexity is optimal in the message length. This improves on recent work of Banghale et al. (ASIACRYPT `22) by giving a simplified and more efficient broadcast extension protocol for the asynchronous setting that avoids the use of cryptographic accumulators.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>If your API security isn’t airtight, your entire operation is a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>Why? Well, hackers aren&rsquo;t guessing passwords; they’re exploiting weak authentication and wide-open authorization doors (which are some of the most common functions of APIs).</p>
<p>This is where you either tighten your defenses or become vulnerable. Mastering authentication and authorization isn&rsquo;t optional—it’s survival. This guide explains how to lock down your APIs, protect user data, and keep your systems bulletproof in a world where digital threats never sleep.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>AWS Firewall Manager is a powerful tool that organizations can use to define common AWS WAF rules with centralized security policies. These policies specify which accounts and resources are in scope. Firewall Manager creates a web access control list (web ACL) that adheres to the organization’s policy requirements and associates it with the in-scope resources. Figure 1 shows a Firewall Manager security policy and web ACL created in each in-scope account.</p>

		<p>A detailed walkthrough demonstrates how attackers can manipulate Azure Key Vault’s access policies after compromising Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) credentials.</p>
<p>According to Faran Siddiqui, a penetration tester report, a “Key Vault 06 – Abuse Decryption Key,” shed light on this critical vulnerability and the technique involving AzureAD CLI and Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>The breakdown stems from “Key Vault 06 – Abuse Decryption Key,” a security lab scenario focused on helping red team testers and penetration testers understand potential threats in the Azure Key Vault ecosystem.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine a modern working world without Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS) applications? Productivity, communication, and project management solutions have transformed the modern workplace, enabling hybrid and remote working, helping to cut costs, and offering unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Without them, the business world would grind to a halt. But these applications, like anything connected to the internet, are vulnerable to cyber threats. Part of the problem is that SaaS providers are responsible for securing SaaS infrastructure, platforms, and application&hellip;</p>
