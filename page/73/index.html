		<p>Key Takeaways for Control 3 At the heart of a strong data management plan is awareness surrounding the &rsquo; Five Ws&rsquo; of the enterprise&rsquo;s data: What data does the enterprise store or handle? Who should have access to it? Where is it stored or accessed? When should it be deleted? Why does it need protection? A comprehensive data management plan incorporates the answers to these questions with policy decisions and incident response procedures. Knowing what data an enterprise produces or consumes, as well as being able to classify it based on sensitivity, are the keystones of such a plan&hellip;</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 3, 2025</p>
<p>Today’s security teams are tasked with managing an increasingly intricate web of responsibilities. These range from ensuring compliance and continuous security testing, resilience to integrating security protocols, and managing a growing array of devices—from IoT ecosystems to remote work setups. This complexity often overwhelms even the most experienced teams.</p>

		<p>Today, we announced our commitment to achieving the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) - High, Australian Infosec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP), and Spain’s Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS) as part of Cloudflare for Government. As more and more essential services are being shifted to the Internet, ensuring that governments and regulated industries have industry standard tools is critical for ensuring their uptime, reliability and performance.</p>
<h2 id="what-sets-cloudflare-for-government-apart">What sets Cloudflare for Government apart?</h2>
<p>Cloudflare’s network spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with approximately 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. Our network is our greatest strength to provide resiliency, security, and performance. So instead of creating a siloed government network that has limited access to our products and services, we decided to build the unique government compliance capabilities directly into our platform from the very beginning. We accomplished this by delivering critical controls in three key areas: traffic processing, management, and metadata storage.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In December 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed limited activity by an unattributed threat actor using a publicly available, static ASP.NET machine key to inject malicious code and deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework. In the course of investigating, remediating, and building protections against this activity, we observed an insecure practice whereby developers have incorporated various publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys from publicly accessible resources, such as code documentation and repositories, which threat actors have used to perform malicious actions on target servers.</p>
