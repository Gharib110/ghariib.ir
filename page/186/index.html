<p>What do you feel when you hear the TeamSpeak &ldquo;user entered your channel&rdquo; notification? For some, it&rsquo;s just a basic sound notification; for me, it sends me back to a day when my friends and I were hopping on an audio channel so we could do some 40-man Molten Core raids in World of Warcraft, back when expansions weren&rsquo;t even a thing yet.</p>

		<p>Pipeline execution policies are a newer addition to the GitLab DevSecOps platform and a powerful mechanism to enforce CI/CD jobs across applicable projects. They enable platform engineering or security teams to inject jobs into developers’ YAML pipeline definition files, guaranteeing that certain CI/CD jobs will execute no matter what a developer defines in their `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.</p>
<p>This article will explain how to utilize pipeline execution policies to create guardrails around the stages or jobs that a developer can use in their pipeline definition. In regulated environments, this may be necessary to ensure developers adhere to a standard set of jobs or stages in their GitLab pipeline. Any job or stage that a developer adds to their pipeline that does not adhere to a corporate standard will cause the pipeline to fail.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Recently, I looked at Microsoft’s assigned CVSS v3.1 scores for Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities alongside the Microsoft assigned severity ratings. I wanted to revisit these numbers and see just how closely CVSS aligns with Microsoft’s opinion of severity. Disclaimer: I’m aware that CVSS v4.0 exists. However, Microsoft has not yet adopted it, and I wanted an apples-to-apples comparison. What Is CVSS v3.1? CVSS v3.1 provides the Qualitative Severity Rating Scale, which looks like this: Rating CVSS Score None 0.0 Low 0.1 – 3.9 Medium 4.0 – 6.9 High 7.0 – 8.9 Critical 9.0 – 10.0 Source: FIRST.org&hellip;</p>

<p>Oracle announced new Virtualbox 7.1.6 release this Tuesday with various bug-fixes, performance improvements, and minor new features.</p>
<p>VirtualBox had heavy screen tearing and flickering issue in Linux VMs running with recent Kernel and Wayland for a period of time, that’s why I switched to QEMU/KVM.</p>
<p>Since the last 7.1.4, VirtualBox greatly improved the flickering, black screen and other screen update issues. In the new release, it also fixed issue with Linux guest screen flickering when guest was using VMSVGA graphics adapter.</p>

A fresh stable release of Wine — the open-source compatibility layer that makes it possible to run Windows apps and games on Linux and macOS — has been uncorked. More than 6,000 thousand changes were distilled in Wine 10.0, changes collected, collated, and curated over the past 12 months of Wine 9.x development releases. For those who’ve supped the dev cycle builds, the bulk of what’s new in Wine 10.0 will be familiar. Wine is not the ‘everyday essential’ it was in years past. Back then, web-based services weren’t as capable, so folks were wedded to specific pieces of Windows software, […]</p>

		<p> Software security has come a long way in the past two decades. With the advent of new technologies and a rapidly evolving threat landscape, defending against cyber attacks has become more challenging than ever before. We recently presented on the evolution of software security threats and defense strategies at the Security Summit in Milan on 15th March 2023. In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll explore some of the key takeaways from the presentation.</p>

<p>Across 2024, we saw a sharp rise in malware campaigns aimed at macOS users in the enterprise. From infostealers masquerading as business and productivity apps to sophisticated modular backdoors, not to mention plenty of APT activity, threat actors were busier than ever developing and deploying malware to compromise organizations and steal sensitive data.</p>
