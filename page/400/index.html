		<p>So many times, we look beyond the mark. With our feeds constantly inundated with headline-grabbing news about AI-generated threats, nation states upping their cybercrime game, and sophisticated new forms of malware, we can be tempted to think that the bulk of cyberwarfare is going on &ldquo;up there&rdquo; somewhere. In reality, most breaches still originate from unforced errors, and threat actors are just like anybody else – they don&rsquo;t like working harder than they need to. That&rsquo;s why the golden rule of cybercrime seems to be &ldquo;try the easy stuff first.&rdquo; And some of the easiest things are doors that&hellip;</p>

		<p>The holidays are upon us, which means now is the perfect time for gratitude, warmth, and—because modern society has thrust it upon us—gift buying.</p>
<p>It’s Bluey and dig kits and LEGOs for kids, Fortnite and AirPods and backpacks for tweens, and, for an adult you particularly love, it’s televisions, air fryers, e-readers, vacuums, dog-feeders, and more, which all seemingly require a mobile app to function.</p>
<p>“The Internet of Things” is the now-accepted term to describe countless home products that connect to the internet so that they can be controlled and monitored from a mobile app or from a web browser on your computer. The benefits are obvious for shoppers. Thermostats can be turned off during vacation, home doorbells can be answered while at work, and gaming consoles can download videogames as children sleep on Christmas Eve.</p>

		<p>One of the most important lessons emerging in 2024 for the healthcare sector is that entities should diligently prepare contingency plans for potential cyberattacks that seriously disrupt their critical third-party vendors, advises regulatory attorney Betsy Hodge of the law firm Akerman.</p>

		<p>Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR made history in this year’s MITRE ATT&amp;CK Evaluations as the first participant ever to achieve 100% detection with technique-level detail and no configuration changes or delays. Technique-level detections represent the gold standard, equipping security analysts with the precise information needed to identify an attack. This is the second year in a row Cortex XDR has achieved 100% detection with no configuration changes or delays, demonstrating unmatched consistency.</p>

		<p>Scammers have devised a new scheme for morally dubious crypto owners.</p>
<p><em>“I have a question. I have USDT stored in my wallet, and I have the seed phrase. How to transfer my funds to another wallet?”</em> — we found a comment like this under a finance-related video on YouTube. And the seed phrase was revealed in full in the comment.</p>
<p>This looked suspicious: even a complete cryptocurrency beginner should know better than to share their seed phrase with the entire world. We were wary, and for a good reason — this comment turned out to be a scam.</p>
