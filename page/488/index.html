		<p>Phishing remains one of the most dangerous and persistent cyber threats for individuals and organizations. Modern attacks use a growing arsenal of deceptive techniques that bypass traditional secure email gateways (SEGs) and email authentication measures, targeting organizations, employees, and vendors. From business email compromise (BEC) to QR phishing and account takeovers, these threats are designed to exploit weaknesses across multiple communication channels, including email, Slack, Teams, SMS, and cloud drives.</p>

		<p>The Time Zone Database Package (<code>tzdata</code>) provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with the time zone information needed for all applications or runtimes in the operating system to print local time correctly. The GNU C Library (glibc) uses the <code>tzdata</code> package, so APIs like <code>strftime()</code> work correctly, while applications such as <code>/usr/bin/date</code> use this information to print the local date.</p>
<p>The <code>tzdata</code> package contains the data files describing current and historic transitions for various time zones worldwide. This data represents changes required by local governments, time zone boundary changes, UTC offsets, and daylight saving time (DST).</p>

		<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, incident response, and business continuity planning, preparedness is key. In today’s environment, where breaches and disruptions are inevitable, organizations cannot afford to operate with untested protocols or vague plans. This is where <strong>tabletop exercises</strong> come in—providing a structured, scenario-based approach to testing and refining an organization’s readiness for real-world crises.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-tabletop-exercises-and-why-do-they-matter">What Are Tabletop Exercises and Why Do They Matter?</h2>
<p>Tabletop exercises are facilitated discussions that simulate various incident scenarios—such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, or compliance failures. These exercises aren’t just theoretical; they are practical, interactive, and designed to uncover critical weaknesses in processes and decision-making.</p>

		<p>On December 18, the Cyber Threat Alert Level was evaluated and is remaining at Blue (Guarded) due to a vulnerability affecting multiple Cleo products. On December 12, the MS-ISAC released an advisory for a vulnerability in Cleo products that could allow for remote code execution. Organizations and users are advised to update and apply all appropriate vendor security patches to vulnerable systems and to continue to update their antivirus signatures daily. Another line of defense includes user awareness training regarding the threats posed by attachments and hypertext links contained in emails especially from un-trusted sources.</p>
