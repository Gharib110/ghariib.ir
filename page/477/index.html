		<p>Cloudflare Stream launched AI-powered automated captions to transcribe English in on-demand videos in March 2024. Customers&rsquo; immediate next questions were about other languages — both <em>transcribing</em> audio from other languages, and <em>translating</em> captions to make subtitles for other languages. As the Stream Product Manager, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about how we might tackle these, but I wondered…</p>
<p><strong>What if I just translated a generated</strong> <strong>VTT</strong> <strong>(caption file)? Can we do that?</strong> I hoped to use Workers AI to conduct a quick experiment to learn more about the problem space, challenges we may find, and what platform capabilities we can leverage.</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity is a fast-growing field, with a constant need for skilled professionals. But unlike other professions — like medicine or aviation — there’s no clear-cut pathway to qualifying for cybersecurity positions. For employers and job seekers alike, this can make the journey to building a team (or entering a successful cybersecurity career) feel uncertain. Enter the registered apprenticeship program — a proven method for developing skilled talent in cybersecurity that benefits both the employer and the new professional. Let’s commit to supporting this important talent development approach</p>
