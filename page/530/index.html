<p>Kali Linux has had support for WSL for <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">some time</a>, but its usefulness has been somewhat limited. This was mostly due to restrictions placed on some system calls , most importantly those revolving <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1349">around networking</a>. Furthermore, additional issues with speed, specifically I/O, were also problematic. Because of this, Kali WSL has mostly been relegated to reporting functions after an assessment is completed. A cool technology, and certainly an amazing engineering feat, but as is, it just was not that useful in the field.</p>
