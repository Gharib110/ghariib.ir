		<p>Cloud security remains an evolving challenge as new attack vectors emerge, often leveraging misconfigurations rather than outright software vulnerabilities. In August 2024, researchers at <strong>Datadog Security Labs</strong> uncovered a novel <strong>name confusion attack</strong> that exploits a misconfiguration in the way <strong>Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</strong> are retrieved within AWS environments. This attack, dubbed <strong>whoAMI</strong>, enables adversaries to execute arbitrary code within AWS accounts by manipulating AMI selection mechanisms.</p>
<p>This report provides an in-depth analysis of the <strong>whoAMI attack</strong>, its underlying mechanisms, real-world impact, mitigation strategies, and best practices for cloud security professionals.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The Go programming language has reached another significant milestone with the release of version 1.24. We at Red Hat are particularly excited about one of its standout features, native FIPS 140-3 support. This addition represents a major step forward for Go&rsquo;s adoption in enterprise and government environments where security compliance is paramount.</p>
<h2 id="native-fips-support">Native FIPS support</h2>
<p>The introduction of the FIPS Cryptographic Module in Go 1.24 marks a watershed moment for the language&rsquo;s security capabilities. This new module provides FIPS 140-3-compliant implementations of cryptographic algorithms, seamlessly integrated into the standard library. What makes this particularly noteworthy is its transparent implementation. Existing Go applications can leverage FIPS-compliant cryptography without requiring code changes.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The ability to effectively visualize and manage data flows is crucial for organizational success. As businesses generate vast amounts of data, understanding how this information moves between sources and targets becomes essential for making informed decisions. Without a clear data flow mapping strategy, companies risk mismanaging their data assets.</p>

</p>
<p>Data flow mapping involves defining data sources and targets, identifying data requirements, and employing various mapping techniques to ensure seamless data movement. From manual efforts to sophisticated automated solutions, organizations must choose the best approach that caters to their specific needs, all while addressing challenges such as data complexity and integration with legacy systems.</p>

		<p>Kubernetes 1.31 completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems.</p>

<p>– Listen to the Podcast</p>
<p>Yahoo. Sony. Uber. SolarWinds. These companies all have one thing in common: Collateral damage to a brand for years after suffering a cyberattack.</p>
<p>Investopedia, one of the world’s leading sources of financial content on the web, took a look at 10 ways cybercrime is affecting businesses today. The reputational impact of cyber incidents can outlast all other consequences, affecting an organization’s relationships with customers, partners, and investors.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hardly a day goes by without a policy announcement or public statement by President Trump that betrays a nationalist instinct. The first problem with nationalism is semantics. People tend to confuse it with patriotism, a deeply felt emotion that a nationalist can easily stir with a discourse that equates love of country with hostility to the outside world and, domestically, to those presented as a threat to the nation. </p>
<p>Economic nationalists often emphasize the need to protect the nation from perceived threats rather than focusing on the alleged economic advantages of their policies. They argue that foreign countries are taking advantage of us or that a competitor’s dominance in areas like science, technology, or industry is an affront to our nation’s greatness. The latter can be seen when Trump points to Taiwan’s leadership in the chip industry. Taiwan’s leadership is only admissible if its companies make their semiconductors in the U.S.—under threat of reprisals if they don’t.</p>

<p><em><strong>Authored By Sakshi Jaiswal</strong></em> </p>
<p>McAfee Labs recently observed a surge in phishing campaigns that use fake viral video links to trick users into downloading malware. The attack relies on social engineering, redirecting victims through multiple malicious websites before delivering the payload. Users are enticed with promises of exclusive content, ultimately leading them to fraudulent pages and deceptive download links.  </p>
