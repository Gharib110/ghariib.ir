		<p>The sudden rise of DeepSeek has raised concerns and questions, especially about the origin and destination of the training data, as well as the security of the data.</p>
<p>For those returning from a short holiday away from the news, DeepSeek is a new player on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. The Chinese startup has certainly taken the app stores by storm: In just a week after the launch it topped the charts as the most downloaded free app in the US. This caused an upset on the stock markets that cost nVidia and Oracle shareholders a lot of money.</p>

<p>Over the years, Apple has continuously refined its security mechanisms to deter unauthorized access to their devices. One of the most significant aspects of this evolution is the increasingly sophisticated passcode protection system in iOS devices. This article explores how the delay between failed passcode attempts has evolved over time, highlighting changes that have made iOS screen lock protection more secure.</p>
<h2 id="early-stages">Early Stages</h2>
<p>In the early days of iOS, passcode attempts were practically unlimited. The delay between failed attempts would increase over time, but in extreme cases, the wait time could reach absurd numbers -sometimes even displaying “Next attempt in 100 million years.” There are plenty of screenshots of these exaggerated lockout periods available on the net.</p>

<p>A successful Operation Talent, led by Europol and German authorities, has culminated in the seizure of two major hacking forums and the arrest of related suspects. ‘Cracked’ and ‘Nulled’ forums were notorious for acting as a central hub for cybercrime, hosting AI-based security scanners, stolen databases, and hacking scripts, as well as supporting illegal activities like credential stuffing, malware distribution, and the sale of cracked software. The forums hosted over 10 million users between them before the takedown.</p>

<p>The evolution of cyber security is no longer just about reacting to threats; it is about staying perpetually ahead in a world defined by complexity and speed. Autonomous cyber security represents a bold, transformative leap into the future—where intelligent, AI-driven systems operate at the edge of innovation, detecting, preventing, and responding to threats with unparalleled precision. This journey is more than technological advancement—it is a paradigm shift. By creating systems that think, reason, and act autonomously, organizations are poised to outpace adversaries and redefine what it means to be secure in an increasingly digitized world. The further along this journey […]</p>

		<p>See which reasons are the only valid ones for upgrading your gaming PC.</p>
<p>Whenever a new generation of CPUs or GPUs drops, PC users are susceptible to a wave of FOMO clouding their rational thinking. From the announcement livestreams and preview benchmarks to third-party reviews and stock issues, everyone gets swept up in the hype. On the one hand, this is what we look forward to every year or two, but on the other hand, a fancy new product doesn&rsquo;t magically make your existing PC trash.</p>

		<p>President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and a further 10% tariff on Chinese imports, to take effect on Feb. 1. In doing so Trump built on tariffs he put into effect during his first term—tariffs that President Joe Biden largely kept in place or added to. This resurgence of tariffs provide a good reason for revisiting economic history and what the science of economics tells us about international trade.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 29, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is projected to cost the global economy a staggering $10.5 trillion annually by the end of 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015.</p>
<p>The rise of cybercrime has affected law enforcement agencies globally and India is no exception. Police forces are facing significant challenges as they grapple with the evolving nature of cyber threats and the increasing complexity of investigating and preventing cybercrimes. The sheer volume of cybercrimes in India, as recently recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India, is overwhelming.</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>So, let’s start with the basics: what is platform engineering and what led to its development? Platform engineering was developed in response to the increasing complexity of software development and the need for streamlined, efficient processes. In the early days of DevOps, a strict division existed between the developer (the person who created the software) and operations (the person who deployed and managed the software on a daily basis). Maintaining systems and infrastructure fell into a grey area for the developer— often the developer role had to sort out their own infrastructure and s</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Australian news outlet ABC NEWS analyzed a data set of 29 million 4-digit PIN numbers that people actually used to secure their devices, ATM withdrawals, building access, and more.</p>
<p>What the outlet discovered is both expected and disappointing: Too many people use insecure PIN codes to protect important parts of their lives.</p>
<p>Now, I feel compelled to add that I’ve always considered any four-digit string of numbers as simply too few numbers to secure anything important. It takes only 10,000 tries in a worst-case scenario for the attacker, which is not an awful lot for a determined—and sometimes machine-assisted—attacker.</p>
