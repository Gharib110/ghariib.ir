	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SonicWall SonicOS that could allow for authentication bypass. SonicOS is SonicWall’s operating system designed for their firewalls and other security devices. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for authentication bypass on the affected system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then; view, change, or delete data.</p>

<p><strong>High Cohesion</strong> (Tính liên kết cao) là một nguyên tắc quan trọng trong thiết kế phần mềm hướng đối tượng. Nguyên tắc này đảm bảo rằng mỗi lớp hoặc module chỉ chịu trách nhiệm cho một nhóm nhỏ các chức năng liên quan chặt chẽ với nhau. Mục tiêu của nguyên lý này là tạo ra các lớp dễ duy trì, dễ hiểu và có thể tái sử dụng cao.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Parametrizing Maximal Orders Along Supersingular $ell$-Isogeny Paths</strong><br>
<em>Laia Amorós, James Clements, Chloe Martindale</em></p>
<p>Suppose you have a supersingular $ell$-isogeny graph with vertices given by $j$-invariants defined over $mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, where $p = 4 cdot f cdot ell^e - 1$ and $ell equiv 3 pmod{4}$. We give an explicit parametrization of the maximal orders in $B_{p,infty}$ appearing as endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves in this graph that are $leq e$ steps away from a root vertex with $j$-invariant 1728. This is the first explicit parametrization of this kind and we believe it will be an aid in better understanding the structure of supersingular $ell$-isogeny graphs that are widely used in cryptography. Our method makes use of the inherent directions in the supersingular isogeny graph induced via Bruhat-Tits trees, as studied in [1]. We also discuss how in future work other interesting use cases, such as $ell=2$, could benefit from the same methodology.</p>

		<p>Job Posting: <strong>PhD in Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>King&rsquo;s College London</em></p>
<p>We are inviting applications for a PhD studentship in the cryptography lab at King&rsquo;s College London. Specifically, we are looking for an applicant to work with Martin Albrecht and Benjamin Dowling.</p>
<p>The PhD could, for example, cover cryptanalysing existing cryptographic technologies/protocols, such as Telegram or WhatsApp, or modelling and designing new cryptographic protocols or primitives.</p>
<p>This PhD will work in a team consisting of social scientists, specifically ethnographers, and us cryptographers. Together, we study what the security needs and wants of participants in large-scale protests are and how these relate to the security guarantees provided by cryptographic solutions.</p>

<li>Advanced (e.g. homomorphic, attribute-based, functional, laconic) encryption and (e.g. ring, group, threshold, blind) signature schemes</li>
<li>Time cryptography (e.g. time-lock puzzle, verifiable delay function, proof of sequential work)</li>
<li>Fine-grained cryptography (e.g. against bounded-space-time adversaries)</li>
<li>Lower bounds and impossibility results</li>
<li>Key exchange and secure messaging</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to drop us an email for discussions about the topics.</p>
