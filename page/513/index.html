		<p>HP has revealed its refreshed lineups for HP laptops, monitors, and desktops, along with new HyperX mice aimed squarely at gamers.</p>
<p>AI is in the air at CES 2025, both on the software and hardware side, with companies looking to merge the two wherever possible. We have already seen this from Acer and Asus today. Now, it seems like HP is ready to throw its hat into the ring with its latest range of Victus and Omen products.</p>

	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Virtual appliances (pre-configured virtual machine images ready to run on a hypervisor) have been commonly used for many years as a preferred mechanism to package and distribute applications. Virtual appliances eliminate the installation, configuration, and maintenance costs associated with running complex software stacks. </p>
<p>The Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) format is a standardized way to package and distribute virtual appliances. OVA files can be deployed across various virtualization platforms like VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, and more. An OVA file is basically an archive file, which includes an OVF file with all the metadata about the virtual appliance, and one or more virtual disk images. The Open Virtual Format file (OVF) within the OVA archive is basically an XML file with all the metadata needed by a virtualization platform to create virtual machines based on the OVA. Throughout this article we will use the LAMP OVA as an example. LAMP OVA is publicly available from Bitnami—a well known distributor of virtual appliances. Looking into the OVF inside this OVA, we can see the hardware requirements as well as some basic information about what&rsquo;s in the OVA (for readability, the file has been truncated and only XML elements for basic requirements are shown):</p>

		<p>The current content delivery network (CDN) provider Edgio, used by Azure DevOps is retiring. We’re urgently transitioning to a solution served by Akamai and Azure Front Door CDNs to maintain the responsiveness of our services.</p>
<p><strong>What this means for you</strong></p>
<p>For most of you, this transition will be seamless. To ensure that you can continue to access Azure DevOps without any interruptions, use the following <strong>Powershell commands</strong> to validate that your current firewall settings allow connectivity to the new CDN providers:</p>

<p>You know that “Hi, how are you?” text from a stranger? It’s one of the top scams worldwide—right along with those fake delivery notices that try to reel you in a scam site with a fishy link. Now you have extra protection against them and all other kinds of scams with our new McAfee Scam Detector.</p>
<p>The time’s right for it too. Those scam stats above came from our latest research, which also uncovered just how often people get hit with scams and how costly they can be. 59% of Americans said they or someone they know has fallen for an online scam in the last 12 months, with scam victims losing an average of $1,471 to the scam.</p>

<p>In the quest for an accurate frequency standard there are many options depending on your budget, but one of the most affordable is an oven controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO). [RF Burns] has a video looking at one of the cheapest of these, a sub ten dollar AliExpress module.</p>
<p>A crystal oven is a simple enough device — essentially just a small box containing a crystal oscillator and a thermostatic heater. By keeping the crystal at a constant temperature it has the aim of removing thermal drift from its output frequency, meaning that once it is calibrated it can be used as a reasonably good frequency standard. The one in question is a 10 MHz part on a small PCB with power supply regulator and frequency trimming voltage potentiometer, and aside from seeing it mounted in an old PSU case we also are treated to an evaluation of its adjustment and calibration.</p>
