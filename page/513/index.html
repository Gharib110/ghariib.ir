<p>With 2023 coming to an end and before the holiday season starts, we thought today would be a good time to <a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release</a> <strong>Kali 2023.4</strong>. Whilst this release may not have the most end-user features in it again, there are a number of new platform offerings and there has still been a lot of changes going on behind-the-scenes for us, which has a positive knock-on effect resulting in a benefit for everyone. News, platforms, and features aside, it would not be a Kali release if there was not a number of changes to our packages - both new tools and upgrades to existing ones. If you want to see what is new for yourself <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download</a> a new image or <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">upgrade <em>if you already have a Kali Linux installation</em></a>.</p>
