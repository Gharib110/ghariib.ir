		<p>Before we get into it, I would like to thank whatever powers that be who selected my previous post as top 7 featured of the week. I&rsquo;m quite proud of that, and now I&rsquo;m motivated to do more writing, so let&rsquo;s get into it!</p>
<p>After seeing that a certain company in my area (70-ish miles away, close enough) was looking for experience in SvelteKit, I decided to try it out. Most of my experience is in PHP frameworks utilizing Timber/Twig, but I want to get more familiar with JavaScript frameworks. What better way to learn than diving in? What I&rsquo;ve chosen to do is hop on devChallenges, pick a project which comes fully loaded with a design, and go to town. I chose Simple Coffee Listing as my first since it seemed simple enough.</p>

		<p>Key Takeaways for Control 3 At the heart of a strong data management plan is awareness surrounding the &rsquo; Five Ws&rsquo; of the enterprise&rsquo;s data: What data does the enterprise store or handle? Who should have access to it? Where is it stored or accessed? When should it be deleted? Why does it need protection? A comprehensive data management plan incorporates the answers to these questions with policy decisions and incident response procedures. Knowing what data an enterprise produces or consumes, as well as being able to classify it based on sensitivity, are the keystones of such a plan&hellip;</p>
