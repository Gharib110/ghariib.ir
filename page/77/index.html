		<p>The last several days have been dubbed a ‚ÄúSputnik moment‚Äù for Americans, who are discovering that foreign software engineers are much further ahead than previously thought. On January 20th, the Chinese company DeepSeek announced the release of their newest large language model (LLM) ‚ÄúDeepSeek R1.‚Äù Reportedly trained for just $6 million, DeepSeek R1 achieves capabilities that more than rival the output of American AI giants like Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Google, whose models have required billions in investment.¬†</p>

		<p><strong>1. Problema da forma serializada padr√£o</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A forma serializada padr√£o pode tornar imposs√≠vel substituir uma implementa√ß√£o descart√°vel.</li>
<li>Muitas classes da biblioteca Java, como BigInteger, sofreram com essa limita√ß√£o.</li>
<li>Deve-se avaliar se a forma serializada padr√£o √© apropriada em termos de flexibilidade, desempenho e corre√ß√£o.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Quando a forma serializada padr√£o √© aceit√°vel?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quando a representa√ß√£o f√≠sica do objeto √© id√™ntica ao seu conte√∫do l√≥gico.</li>
<li>Exemplo: uma classe Name com tr√™s String (sobrenome, primeiro nome e nome do meio).</li>

		<p>Late last year, Rubrik announced a collaboration with Red Hat to support Rubrik Security Cloud on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, and we‚Äôre excited to share that this is now official. Rubrik Security Cloud paired with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization helps organizations more easily migrate and protect virtual machines (VMs) and applications running on a consistent, trusted and comprehensive application platform. As enterprise organizations migrate their workloads from VM environments to cloud-native platforms such as OpenShift, they must understand differences in storage between virtualiz</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Learning from Functionality Outputs: Private Join and Compute in the Real World</strong><br>
<em>Francesca Falzon, Tianxin Tang</em></p>
<p>Private Join and Compute (PJC) is a two-party protocol recently proposed by Google for various use-cases, including ad conversion (Asiacrypt 2021) and which generalizes their deployed private set intersection sum (PSI-SUM) protocol (EuroS&amp;P 2020).</p>
<p>PJC allows two parties, each holding a key-value database, to privately evaluate the inner product of the values whose keys lie in the intersection. While the functionality output is not typically considered in the security model of the MPC literature, it may pose real-world privacy risks, thus raising concerns about the potential deployment of protocols like PJC.</p>
