	<div>
		<p>It may sound weird when I say that I would like to remember 2024 as the year of the biggest breaches. That’s mainly because that would mean we’ll never see another year like it.</p>
<p>To support this nomination, I will remind you of several high-profile breaches, some of a size almost beyond imagination, some that really left us worried because of the type of data that was stolen, and a few duds.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would prohibit data brokers from selling or transferring location and health data.</p>
<p>Data brokers have drawn attention this year by leaking several large databases, with the worst being the National Public Data leak. The data breach made international headlines because it affected hundreds of millions of people, and it included Social Security Numbers.</p>
<p>All this when data brokers had already been faced with reforms in the shape of the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA). Hwoever, APRA is not expected to pass before Congress wraps up for the year, and some lawmakers feel the need for extra data regulations.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Remediation has long been a sore spot in data security posture management (DSPM). Many of the currently available solutions are great at surfacing alerts but offer no real way for Security teams to take action without a separate effort to integrate with external remediation tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce a new and ready-to-use integration between Prisma Cloud DSPM and Cortex XSOAR. This latest development allows organizations to automatically remediate data security risks (or initiate relevant remediation workflows) and to easily incorporate data security risks, policies and classifications into new and existing remediation playbooks. For Palo Alto Networks, this represents another step toward our vision of further platformization in cloud security.</p>

<p>DEF CON thrives on community collaboration and has operated for over 30 years successfully working with hundreds of vendors including the dozens that have helped with our badges over the years. For this year’s Raspberry Pi badges, DEF CON hired Entropic Engineering to do the hardware development and firmware. After going overbudget by more than 60%, several bad-faith charges, and with a product still in preproduction, DEF CON issued a stop work order. Any claims that DEF CON did not pay Entropic Engineering for its hardware or firmware development are false. Unfortunately, we heard that these issues with Entropic Engineering were not unique to DEF CON. We decided at that point to finish the badge on our own. We paid to send engineers to Vietnam to work onsite to finalize and test the badges in order to ensure they would be done on time for the conference. We never removed Entropic Engineering’s logo from our badge, it is still on the PCB. However, Entropic was not involved in the design and production of the case, and we removed their logo we had added as a courtesy.</p>
