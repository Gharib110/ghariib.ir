<p>A simple yet intriguing idea is worth sharing, even if it wasnâ€™t a flawless success: it can inspire others. [Richard]â€™s experiment with a motion-powered AirTag fits this bill. Starting with our call for simple projects, [Richard] came up with a circuit that selectively powers an AirTag based on movement. His concept was to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a microcontroller to switch the AirTag on only when itâ€™s on the move, creating a stealthy and battery-efficient tracker.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The evolution of computing has been marked by a series of remarkable technology transitions, each reshaping industries, economies, and everyday life. From the early days of mainframes to the rise of cloud computing and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), these transitions have been pivotal in defining the digital age we live in today. Some of the most significant changes in computing history have had a profound impact on how we interact with technology and how businesses and individuals leverage the power of computing. These large-scale transitions were not just incremental improvements but transformative shifts that forever altered the landscape of technology and society.</p>

		<p>Hereâ€™s your opportunity to empower the teen in your life to get a start in open source development.</p>
<p>The post Supporting the next generation of developers appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>We believe that software is at the center of human progress and that all software builds on the work of others, especially open source, through an interconnected community of developers. We need to level the playing field to spark innovation on a global level, and that includes helping early developers get the best start possible. We believe that all developers can solve problems, innovate, and create collaboratively through code. This is why we aspire to empower 1 billion individuals to become developers, and work to help break down barriers to entry for those who wish to join the field and participate in the community.</p>

		<p><strong>2025: AI, Sustainability, Local Clouds, and Data Detox</strong></p>
<p>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Predicting 2025.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2025! where technology doesn&rsquo;t just evolve; it grows, adapts, and occasionally drawing interests at our habits. From mind-liked communication that might finally feel texting a thing of the past, to 3D-printed organs(because who wouldn&rsquo;t want to have a backup heart and organs on our hand, right?), the innovations of the future are set to not only disrupt industries but to redefine how one can live, work, and maybe even procrastinate. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll explore the most mind-blowing, game-changing technologies that might become a mainstream in coming years, and let us just say-the future? It might just be stranger (and more exciting) than we think.<br>
So, get ready for a sneak peak into this chapter of human innovation!</p>

<p>The DoJ has indicted three Russian nationals â€“ Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov â€“ for operating cryptocurrency mixing services Blender[.]io and Sinbad[.]io. These mixers, used heavily by ransomware gangs and North Korean hackers, laundered criminal proceeds, including ransomware payouts and stolen cryptocurrency. Blender[.]io operated from 2018 to 2022 and helped Lazarus Group launder $500 million of the $617 million stolen in the Axie Infinity Ronin bridge attack. After the site was shut down, Sinbad[.]io emerged, offering similar services until it was seized in November 2023 in a joint law enforcement operation.</p>

<p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), set to become fully enforceable on January 17, 2025, represents a significant evolution in the regulatory landscape for financial institutions operating within, or engaging with, the European Union (EU). Although DORA is primarily targeted at entities within the EU, its implications extend globally, notably impacting U.S.-based banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) organizations that have business relationships with EU financial institutions.Â </p>
