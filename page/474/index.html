		<p>At Tuta our focus is to keep our users&rsquo; data secure with quantum-safe encryption. To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords and the password length are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But given new threats of quantum computers, what is the optimal minimum password length recommended by NIST and CISA?</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 18, 2024</p>
<p>Global cybercrime costs are rising rapidly, with estimates reaching $10.5 trillion by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. These financial hits stem from issues like damaged or stolen data, productivity losses, business disruptions, fraud, and the costly aftermath of recovery. The good news? Investing in the right cybersecurity solutions can empower your organization to defend against and recover from cybercrime and other IT-related incidents prevalent in our evolving digital landscape.</p>

<p>If you’ve owned a CD player or other piece of consumer digital audio gear manufactured since the 1980s, the chances are it has a TOSLINK port on the back. This is a fairly simple interface that sends I2S digital audio data down a short length of optical fibre, and it’s designed to run between something like a CD player and an external DAC. It’s ancient technology in optical fibre terms, with a lowish data rate and plastic fibre, but consider for a minute whether it could be adapted for modern ultra-high-speed conenctions. It’s what [Ben Cartwright-Cox] has done, and he delivered a talk about it at the recent 38C3 event in Germany.</p>

		<p>2FA over SMS isn&rsquo;t just unreliable, it&rsquo;s also a security risk.</p>
<p>MFA, or Multi-Factor Authentication, has proliferated throughout our computing lives over the last decade. It largely began with SMS-based authentication in addition to a password, allowing users to add an extra layer of authentication by forcing users to enter a code sent to their phone upon an attempted login. The truth is, SMS-based authentication was never secure. Due to the inherent technology and the infrastructure around SIM cards, 2FA with SMS is not only inadequate; it also actively compromises your security, and here are 4 reasons why you should use a dedicated 2FA app instead.</p>

<p>When it comes to tools you should use on your PC, Task Manager is one of the more useful tools for power users on Windows 11. It&rsquo;s quite common to use it for basic functionality like ending processes that refuse to close, but aside from that, there is a lot more it can do, too. If you want even more functionality, though, then you should try out an alternative like Task Manager DeLuxe.</p>
