<h1 id="attack-surface-management-you-cant-protect-what-you-cant-see"><strong>Attack surface management: you can’t protect what you can’t see</strong></h1>
<p><strong><em>By Marios Kyriacou</em></strong> </p>
<hr>
<p>Wikipedia defines the attack surface of a software environment as “the sum of the different points where an unauthorised user can try to enter data, extract data, control a device or critical software in an environment.” It goes on to say. “<em><strong>Keeping the attack surface as small as possible is a basic security measure</strong></em>.”</p>

</p>
<p>The latest release of the Site Reliability Guardian incorporates assistance from Dynatrace Davis® AI to automatically derive appropriate threshold targets and adjust them over time to protect your quality improvements. This process, known as auto-adaptive thresholding, eliminates the need to define a static threshold upfront. Instead, it derives the suitable thresholds from previous validation results.</p>
<h2 id="build-an-umbrella-for-development-and-operations">Build an umbrella for Development and Operations</h2>
<p>In modern software engineering, the discipline of platform engineering delivers DevSecOps practices to developers to bridge the gaps between development, security, and operations and enhance the developer experience. A key element in platform engineering is the establishment of fast feedback cycles regarding the quality and security measures of new software releases. To provide automated feedback for developers, the concept of quality gates for static code analysis in continuous integration is widely adopted throughout the industry. However, this perspective differs in the continuous deployment practices of various organizations, where the feedback is either delayed or not returned to the developer.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In penetration testing, we need to collect as much information as possible about the target. Asset detection and information collection determine the probability of discovering security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>How to maximize the target collection range and collect more and more complete subdomains and related domain information as much as possible is very important for our further penetration testing.</p>
<p>This article will share with you domain name-related knowledge, main domain name collection methods, subdomain name collection methods, and some automated tools, etc., hoping to bring you some inspiration.</p>

<p>Dynatrace is proud to be the first AWS global tech partner to offer <strong>ready-to-use CloudFormation templates</strong> for validating the Well-Architected pillars. The Dynatrace CloudFormation templates are now available in the <strong>AWS CloudFormation Public Extensions Registry</strong>, which makes Well-Architected validation even more accessible for AWS users.</p>
<p>Dynatrace and the AWS Well-Architected Framework ensure continuous optimization of cloud architecture, aligning with the key pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. Our previous blog post discussed the importance of integrating Dynatrace with the AWS Well-Architected Framework to enhance your software development lifecycle (SDLC). By leveraging Dynatrace Workflow Automation and the Site Reliability Guardian, organizations can ensure that their applications meet AWS’s best practices across all pillars.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/backstage-authentication-and-catalog-providers-a-practical-guide/">Backstage authentication and catalog providers: A practical guide</a></h1>
	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A previous article demonstrated how you can get an internal developer portal up and running with Backstage on Kubernetes in a few minutes using Red Hat Developer Hub on Red Hat OpenShift. That article configured Red Hat Developer Hub with a guest authentication provider–an acceptable option for experimentation, but unsuitable for production environments where developers are actively using the internal developer portal.</p>
<p>This article guides you through the process of configuring a production-ready authentication provider and a catalog provider to import catalog entities. Specifically, you’ll learn how to use GitHub as an authentication provider, and a GitHub organization as a source of truth for organization data to create user and group entities. </p>

<p>We found it nostalgic to watch [ve3iku] fire up an old Loran-A receiver and, as you can see in the video below, he got it working. If you aren’t familiar with LORAN, it was a common radio navigation technique before GPS took over everything.</p>
<p>LORAN — an acronym for Long Range Navigation — was a US byproduct of World War II and was similar in many ways to Britain’s Gee system. However, LORAN operated at lower frequencies to improve its range. It was instrumental in helping convoys cross the Atlantic and also found use in the Pacific theater.</p>
