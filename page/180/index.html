		<p>As organizations increase in size, it becomes increasingly difficult and critical to ensure that the right team members have access to the right groups and projects within their development platform. GitLab offers some powerful methods to manage user access, especially now with custom roles, but performing this at scale through a point-and-click user interface can be frustrating. However, all is not lost. You can use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) as a solution. (There are moments where I’m grateful for acronyms.)</p>

		<p>Give your laptop more graphical grunt with an eGPU.</p>
<p>PC gaming is one of the most popular pastimes in the world, and based on Steam&rsquo;s Hardware Survey, a significant percentage of those gamers are playing using a gaming laptop. And, we can see why, because even the most basic laptop is more powerful than a PC gaming handheld, and gives a better experience with a larger screen.</p>

		<p>Last month, Henry Farrell and I convened the Third Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (IWORD 2024) at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg Center in Washington DC. This is a small, invitational workshop on the future of democracy. As with the previous two workshops, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of political scientists, law professors, philosophers, AI researchers and other industry practitioners, political activists, and creative types (including science fiction writers) to discuss how democracy might be reimagined in the current century&hellip;</p>

	<div>
		<p>After TikTok was briefly banned in the US last weekend, an unusual phenomenon unearthed. Reportedly, people are selling iPhones that have TikTok installed for up to $25,000.</p>
<p>This may require some explanation, so bear with me.</p>
<p>TikTok has had a rough time in the US the last weeks. The ban we mentioned originates from back in March, when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would effectively ban TikTok from the US unless Chinese owner ByteDance agreed to give up its share of the immensely popular app.</p>

<p>Wine, the popular free open-source compatibility layer for running Windows apps/games in Linux/Unix, announced new 10.0 major release on Tuesday!</p>
<p>The new release features <strong>Hi-DPI scaling</strong> support. Instead of exposing high-DPI sizes to applications that don’t expect it, it now automatically scale non-DPI aware windows.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Wine 10.0 also added <strong>fully support for ARM64EC</strong>, Microsoft’s API for applications running on Arm devices with Windows 11. As well as fully hybrid ARM64X modules support, allowing to mix ARM64EC and plain ARM64 code into a single binary. However, ARM64 support requires the Kernel page size to be 4K.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find a good criminal these days. I mean a really trustworthy one you can be confident won&rsquo;t lead you up the garden path with false promises of data breaches. Like this guy yesterday:</p>

<p>For my international friends, JB Hi-Fi is a massive electronics retailer down under <em>and they have my data!</em> I mean by design because I&rsquo;ve bought a bunch of stuff from them, so I was curious not just about my own data but because a breach of 12 million plus people would be massive in a country of not much more than double that. So, I dropped the guy a message and asked if he&rsquo;d be willing to help me verify the incident by sharing my own record. I didn&rsquo;t want to post any public commentary about this incident until I had a reasonable degree of confidence it was legit, not given how much impact it could have in my very own backyard.</p>
