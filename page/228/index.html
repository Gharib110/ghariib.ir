		<p><strong>2025: AI, Sustainability, Local Clouds, and Data Detox</strong></p>
<p>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Predicting 2025.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2025! where technology doesn&rsquo;t just evolve; it grows, adapts, and occasionally drawing interests at our habits. From mind-liked communication that might finally feel texting a thing of the past, to 3D-printed organs(because who wouldn&rsquo;t want to have a backup heart and organs on our hand, right?), the innovations of the future are set to not only disrupt industries but to redefine how one can live, work, and maybe even procrastinate. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll explore the most mind-blowing, game-changing technologies that might become a mainstream in coming years, and let us just say-the future? It might just be stranger (and more exciting) than we think.<br>
So, get ready for a sneak peak into this chapter of human innovation!</p>

<p>The DoJ has indicted three Russian nationals â€“ Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov â€“ for operating cryptocurrency mixing services Blender[.]io and Sinbad[.]io. These mixers, used heavily by ransomware gangs and North Korean hackers, laundered criminal proceeds, including ransomware payouts and stolen cryptocurrency. Blender[.]io operated from 2018 to 2022 and helped Lazarus Group launder $500 million of the $617 million stolen in the Axie Infinity Ronin bridge attack. After the site was shut down, Sinbad[.]io emerged, offering similar services until it was seized in November 2023 in a joint law enforcement operation.</p>

<p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), set to become fully enforceable on January 17, 2025, represents a significant evolution in the regulatory landscape for financial institutions operating within, or engaging with, the European Union (EU). Although DORA is primarily targeted at entities within the EU, its implications extend globally, notably impacting U.S.-based banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) organizations that have business relationships with EU financial institutions.Â </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Triple Ratchet: A Bandwidth Efficient Hybrid-Secure Signal Protocol</strong><br>
<em>Yevgeniy Dodis, Daniel Jost, Shuichi Katsumata, Thomas Prest, Rolfe Schmidt</em></p>
<p>Secure Messaging apps have seen growing adoption, and are used by billions of people daily. However, due to imminent threat of a &ldquo;Harvest Now, Decrypt Later&rdquo; attack, secure messaging providers must react know in order to make their protocols $textit{hybrid-secure}$: at least as secure as before, but now also post-quantum (PQ) secure. Since many of these apps are internally based on the famous Signal&rsquo;s Double-Ratchet (DR) protocol, making Signal hybrid-secure is of great importance.</p>

<h2 id="reference-counting-and-the-garbage-collector">Reference counting and the Garbage Collector</h2>
<p>One thing to know about Python is that its Garbage Collector uses reference counting. It means that every Python object has a <em>ref counter</em> that knows how many references are pointing to the object.<br>
Our first goal is to visualise that <em>ref counter</em> for any object from the Python interpreter.</p>
