		<p>Make sure you change these setting in Obsidian before using it.</p>
<p>Obsidian has exploded in popularity as a powerful knowledge base and note-taking tool. But let’s be honest, the out-of-the-box settings aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. Obsidian can feel a bit bland and underwhelming with the default settings. Instead of settling with it, go through these simple tweaks to instantly elevate your Obsidian experience.</p>

	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hey there! If you’ve been spending any time around technology, coding, or even just browsing the web, you’ve probably come across the term “API.” But, let’s be real for a moment—what exactly is an API? What does it do, and why should you care? Don&rsquo;t worry, I’m here to help you understand it in a super easy way.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-an-api">What Exactly is an API?</h2>
<p>To break it down, an API (Application Programming Interface) is basically a way for one piece of software or application to communicate with another. Think of it as a waiter at a restaurant. The waiter takes your order (request), passes it to the kitchen (the system that processes the request), and then brings you the food (response). APIs do the same thing, but with data between software systems instead of food!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cloudops">What Is CloudOps? </h2>
<p>CloudOps, or Cloud Operations, is a model for managing and delivering cloud-based services in a reliable, efficient, and scalable manner. It’s a set of <strong>best practices, principles, and tools</strong> that ensure the smooth functioning of cloud-based platforms and applications. It transcends the traditional boundaries of IT operations, encompassing aspects like automation, monitoring, security, and compliance, thereby providing a holistic approach to cloud management.</p>

<p>Event streaming is a powerful data processing paradigm where events—small, immutable pieces of data—are continuously produced, captured, and processed in real time. Apache Kafka, an open-source distributed event streaming platform, has become the go-to solution for implementing event streaming in modern systems.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-events-and-streams">Understanding Events and Streams</h2>
<p>An <strong>event</strong> is a record of an occurrence, such as a user clicking a button, a temperature sensor reporting a reading, or an e-commerce platform logging a purchase. These events are ingested and stored in Kafka as messages.<br>
A <strong>stream</strong> is an unbounded sequence of these events, organized into <strong>topics</strong> in Kafka. Each topic serves as a logical channel for related events (e.g., a topic for user activity logs or financial transactions).</p>

<p>What is OpenTelemetry? The range of open source observability technologies can be daunting, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed. When it comes to managing complex multicloud environments and the services that run on them, however, it’s important to standardize, which is where OpenTelemetry comes in. OpenTelemtery was born from the combination of OpenCensus and OpenTracing and has emerged as the open source telemetry standard.</p>

<p>Prometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit primarily designed for reliability and scalability. It is widely used to track various performance metrics, such as system health, availability, and uptime, making it an essential tool for modern cloud-native applications and microservices architectures. Originally developed by SoundCloud in 2012, it has grown to become a popular solution within the cloud-native ecosystem, especially due to its seamless integration with Kubernetes, Docker, and other cloud-based technologies.</p>

		<p>A genius has achieved the impossible by successfully running Windows 11 24H2 on a tiny RAM capacity.</p>
<p>From issuing warnings to those using Windows 11 on older hardware to reiterating its commitment to the TPM 2.0 requirement, Microsoft has shown no interest in relaxing the minimum hardware requirement to run the latest version of Windows. A few months ago, the software giant also patched one of the famous setup exploits used to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.</p>
