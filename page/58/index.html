		<p>See why we think Figma is better than Penpot for UX/UI design.</p>
<p>UX/UI prototyping tools are becoming some of the most important design software in the modern day. With lives lived with computers in our hands, apps, and responsive web design, we need more design intention than what’s been offered in previous years. With Figma, you can easily design and prototype entire websites, apps, or even presentations and small animated videos. With great power and development, it’s no wonder that Figma rules against its open-source alternative of Penpot. Although Penpot is Figma’s best alternative, the real deal is the better option for UX/UI design.</p>

		<p>Data Privacy Week (Jan. 27-31) is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the importance of protecting one of your most valuable assets: your personal information. Whether you’re browsing online as a consumer or running a business, data privacy is paramount in an environment where cyber threats can lurk around every corner.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Data Privacy Week, here are six ideas to help you protect yourself—and your data:</p>
<h2 id="1-understand-your-level-of-risk">1. Understand your level of risk</h2>
<p>Get acquainted with the phrase personally identifiable information. This includes any data that can be used to identify you, and it ranges from your name and address to more sensitive information like   health and financial records. Here are some common examples:</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Revision of CROSS Security: Proofs and Attacks for Multi-Round Fiat-Shamir Signatures</strong><br>
<em>Michele Battagliola, Riccardo Longo, Federico Pintore, Edoardo Signorini, Giovanni Tognolini</em></p>
<p>Signature schemes from multi-round interactive proofs are becoming increasingly relevant in post-quantum cryptography. A prominent example is CROSS, recently admitted to the second round of the NIST on-ramp standardisation process for post-quantum digital signatures. While the security of these constructions relies on the Fiat-Shamir transform, in the case of CROSS the use of the fixed-weight parallel-repetition optimisation makes the security analysis fuzzier than usual. A recent work has shown that the fixed-weight parallel repetition of a multi-round interactive proof is still knowledge sound, but no matching result appears to be known for the non-interactive version. In this paper we provide two main results. First, we explicitly prove the EUF-CMA security of CROSS, filling a gap in the literature. We do this by showing that, in general, the Fiat-Shamir transform of an HVZK and knowledge-sound multi-round interactive proof is EUF-CMA secure. Second, we present a novel forgery attack on signatures obtained from fixed-weight repetitions of 5-round interactive proofs, substantially improving upon a previous attack on parallel repetitions due to Kales and Zaverucha. Our new attack has particular relevance for CROSS, as it shows that several parameter sets achieve a significantly lower security level than claimed, with reductions up to 24% in the worst case.</p>

<h2 id="generative-ai-is-evolvingis-your-security-strategy-keeping-pace"><strong>Generative AI is Evolving—Is Your Security Strategy Keeping Pace?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Generative AI</strong> has quickly become a pivotal element in <strong>digital transformation</strong> across industries, driving automation, enhancing customer interactions, and accelerating software development. But with these advancements come new and complex security challenges. Companies are rushing to adopt <strong>generative AI</strong> to stay competitive, yet many haven’t adapted their cybersecurity practices to handle the emerging threats. When companies designed their cybersecurity policies and controls, few, if any, had generative AI on their bingo card. As a result, we’re seeing organisations unprepared for the unique vulnerabilities this technology introduces.</p>

<p>Content and discussions online are used by people to learn new things and solve problems, and essential for training AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Johannes Wachs, Associate Professor at Corvinus University, and colleagues from UCL and LMU Munich investigated the impact of ChatGPT on the generation of open data on Stack Overflow, an online Q&amp;A platform for computer programmers and an essential source of training data for LLMs.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Always by Your Side: Constructing Traceable Anonymous Credentials with Hardware-Binding</strong><br>
<em>Chang Chen, Guoyu Yang, Qi Chen, Wei Wang, Jin Li</em></p>
<p>With the development of decentralized identity (DID), anonymous credential (AC) technology, as well as its traceability, is receiving more and more attention. Most works introduce a trusted party (regulator) that holds a decryption key or backdoor to directly deanonymize the user identity of anonymous authentication. While some cryptographic primitives can help regulators handle complex tracing tasks among large amounts of user profiles (stored by the issuer) and authentication records (stored by the service provider), additional security primitives are still needed to ensure the privacy of other users. Besides, hardware-binding anonymous credential (hbAC) systems have been proposed to prevent credential sharing or address platform resource constraints, the traceability of hbAC has yet to be discussed.</p>
