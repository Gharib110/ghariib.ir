		<p>Technologists are understandably suffering from category fatigue. This fatigue can be more pronounced within security than in any other sub-sector of IT. Do the use cases and risks of today warrant identity threat detection and response (ITDR)?</p>
<p>To address this question, we work backwards from the vulnerabilities, threats, misconfigurations and attacks that IDTR specializes in providing visibility into.</p>
<p>As identity threat detection and response (ITDR) technology evolves, one of the most common queries we get is: “Why do we need ITDR if we leverage user behavior analytics (UBA) within our security operations (SecOps)?”</p>

<p>In June 2024, we uncovered a security issue related to the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), an open-source project. This discovery adds to the six other vulnerabilities we discovered within AWS services.  The impact of this issue could, in certain scenarios (outlined in the blog), <strong>allow an attacker to gain administrative access to a target AWS account</strong>, resulting in a full account takeover. </p>

	<div>
		<p>Sam Rubin, SVP of Consulting and Threat Intelligence at Unit 42, recently spoke with Sam Sabin, cybersecurity reporter at Axios, about the increasingly destructive cyberattacks organizations face.</p>
<p>The article highlighted how threat actors are shifting their strategies from traditional ransomware attacks to more disruptive methods designed to cripple businesses&rsquo; critical systems and cause extended downtime. While Unit 42 Incident Response insights indicate that the volume of ransomware incidents in 2024 are consistent with 2023, attackers are increasing the intensity of their attacks to force companies into paying higher ransoms.</p>

	<div>
		<p>On November 29th, 2024, Black Friday, shoppers flooded online stores to grab the best deals of the year. But while consumers were busy filling their carts, cyber criminals were also seizing the opportunity to exploit the shopping frenzy. Our system detected a significant surge in Gozi malware activity, targeting financial institutions across North America.</p>
<h2 id="the-black-friday-connection">The Black Friday connection</h2>
<p>Black Friday creates an ideal environment for cyber criminals to thrive. The combination of skyrocketing transaction volumes, a surge in online activity and often lax security awareness among users provides fertile ground for launching attacks. Gozi malware, a well-known banking Trojan, exploits this seasonal chaos to target unsuspecting users and financial institutions alike.</p>

<p>In an organisation with many repositories and developers that are frequently shifting the maintenance of OWNERS and OWNERS_ALIASES files can be tedious. In the passing year a couple of functionalities has been added to help with this.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-aliases">Foreign aliases</h2>
<p>To avoid maintaining the OWNERS_ALIASES file in many repositories you can now refer to the OWNERS_ALIASES file in another repository. In the Jenkins X project we have the main OWNERS_ALIASES file in the jx-community repository. So in the jx repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file only looks like this:</p>
