<h2 id="introducing-kaboxer-v10-again">Introducing Kaboxer v1.0 <em>(Again)</em></h2>
<p>In case you missed it, we have previously covered <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kaboxer">Kaboxer</a> in it’s own <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kaboxer/">dedicated blog post</a>, which goes into a lot more detail of why we love it so! For developers, this is a great new tool in the arsenal. Users will, hopefully, <strong>not realise that they are using it</strong>, only noticing that previously problematic tools now work correctly!</p>

<h2 id="tldr---what-is-this">TL;DR - What is this?</h2>
<p><strong>What is the name about, Kaboxer?</strong> Kali Applications Boxer</p>
<p><strong>What does that mean?</strong> Apps in containers, for packages (a way forward for applications that are hard to package properly). But instead of being stand alone containers, they are integrated into the standard Kali package management systems and can be installed/removed through standard apt commands.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>, one of the things which is important to us, is that we prefer not having to cross-compile our ARM binaries that we ship in our Kali packages. There are various reasons as to why, some of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a huge list of packages, like the one we are maintaining <em>(<a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/penetration-testing-tools-policy/">600+</a> at the time of writing)</em>, there will be a certain small percent that are not ready to be cross-compiled.</li>
<li>We want to be able to run the upstream test suites as part of the build, and in many case the testing software assumes that you can natively run the binaries that you just built.</li>
<li>We believe in “dogfooding” - we create an Operating System, that works on ARM. We want to use the OS, and the tools in it. We do this on <strong>ARM systems for our day-to-day work</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We reached out to Ampere to see if they would be able to help us out. We soon realised they have the same mindset as we do, <strong>ARM is the way forward</strong>. When developing Kali Linux, we treat <strong>ARM devices as “first class citizens”</strong>, just like we do with our “desktop” images <em>(amd64/i386)</em>. There are many advantages to ARM, such as using <strong>less power</strong> <em>(which means they don’t need cooling)</em>, <strong>lighter</strong> <em>(handy when traveling to be on site or mailing devices to be a drop box)</em> and <strong>cheaper devices</strong> <em>(client doesn’t have to return the device!)</em>. These make <strong>really small form factor devices</strong> - which for doing penetration testing or red team exercises on site, expands the possibilities of where to hide various devices <em>(imagination is the only limitation)</em>. This is why we try and give the same user experience regardless of the platform you are using Kali on. <em>This is why we have pre-generated images and build scripts for as many different devices as possible</em></p>

<p>Companies like Facebook aren’t building technology for you, they’re building technology for your data. They collect everything they can from FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp in order to sell visibility into people and their lives.</p>
<p>This isn’t exactly a secret, but the full picture is hazy to most – dimly concealed within complex, opaquely-rendered systems and fine print designed to be scrolled past. The way most of the internet works today would be considered intolerable if translated into comprehensible real world analogs, but it endures because it is invisible.</p>

<p>For anyone wondering what tools I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/superkojiman/pwnbox">pwnbox</a> for a Docker test environment.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools">pwntools</a> for writing the exploits.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> with <code>gdb</code> for debugging.</li>
<li><a href="https://cutter.re/">Cutter</a> with Ghidra’s decompiler for reverse engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controller">Controller</h2>
<p>This binary challenge includes a copy of <code>libc.so.6</code> and is compiled with Full RELRO and NX.</p>
<p>When executed, the binary will ask the user to enter two numbers, and to select from a mathematical operation that will either add, subtract, multiple, or divide the numbers. As long as either of the numbers are not greater than 69, the operation succeeds and the result is printed back to the user. If either of the numbers are greater than 69, the binary exits.</p>

<p>Their products have often been linked to the persecution of imprisoned journalists and activists around the world, but less has been written about what their software <em>actually does</em> or how it works. Let’s take a closer look. In particular, their software is often associated with bypassing security, so let’s take some time to examine the security of their own software.</p>

<p>The latest Signal betas are rolling out today. Inside, you’ll find performance enhancements, a slew of bug fixes, improvements to the mute settings, and if you’re in the United Kingdom, you’ll see support for Signal Payments – a new feature that enables you to send and receive privacy focused payments as easily as sending or receiving a message. This is a beta feature in a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-">beta build</a>, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback.</p>

<p>This new connection method is supported in the latest Signal Android beta release, and will be rolling out to production users in a few days. Our hope is that this will help many people in Iran start sending and receiving messages again while we continue to explore additional censorship circumvention techniques that will work there.</p>
