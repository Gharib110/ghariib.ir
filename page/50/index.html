<p>Scams are big business for cybercriminals, and they’re getting more sophisticated than ever. According to McAfee’s <em>State of the Scamiverse 2025</em> report, the average person encounters 12 scams per day, while Americans see over 14 scam attempts daily, including three deepfake videos.</p>
<p>Fraudsters are leveraging AI-powered tools to create hyper-realistic deepfakes for as little as $5 and 10 minutes, making it harder than ever to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. The financial impact is staggering—87% of scam victims lose money, with one-third losing over $500, and nearly one in ten losing more than $5,000. </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Quantum Key-Recovery Attacks on Permutation-Based Pseudorandom Functions</strong><br>
<em>Hong-Wei Sun</em></p>
<p>Due to their simple security assessments, permutation-based pseudo-random functions (PRFs) have become widely used in cryptography. It has been shown that PRFs using a single $n$-bit permutation achieve $n/2$ bits of security, while those using two permutation calls provide $2n/3$ bits of security in the classical setting. This paper studies the security of permutation-based PRFs within the Q1 model, where attackers are restricted to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We present improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs compared with the previous attacks. Specifically, under the same assumptions/hardware as Grover&rsquo;s exhaustive search attack, i.e. the offline Simon algorithm, we can recover keys in quantum time $tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits. Furthermore, we enhance previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, while maintaining the same time complexity. This implies that permutation-based PRFs become vulnerable when adversaries have access to quantum computing resources. It is pointed out that the above quantum attack can be used to quite a few cryptography, including SoEM, PDMMAC, pEDM, as well as general instantiations like XopEM, EDMEM, EDMDEM, and others.</p>

		<p>Business owners and CEOs across the United States received customized ransomware threats this month from the most unusual of places—letters in the mail.</p>
<p>The letters, which were first reported by multiple cybersecurity researchers, claim to come from a ransomware group called BianLian. But since Malwarebytes first started tracking BianLian nearly one year ago, our intelligence analysts have never seen the cybercriminal gang resort to sending physical letters to make their ransom demands, suggesting that the latest snail mail campaign could be the work of copycats.</p>

		<p>On most computers, there’s the feeling that there’s a one-to-one relationship between you and your operating system. You want to do a task, your operating system makes it possible by opening a window and launching an application. In IT, that balance doesn’t exist. Hundreds and thousands of tasks are required at any given moment. It’s up to the operating system to manage it, and it’s your job to manage the operating system. Amazingly, with the emergence of cloud computing, IT infrastructure is subject to even more demands than before. The operating system you choose essentially become</p>
