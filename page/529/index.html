<p>We reply with a short explanation that lays out why there’s nothing wrong, but we understand the confusion. Nobody would be excited about getting a grade like this on a homework assignment – and you’d have to stay after class and ask the teacher what the hell a “T” even means on your report about summer vacation (“T”oo cool for school?).</p>

Over $6,000 worth of merchandise was sent to Washington D.C. last week in time for the Juneteenth events in the heart of the city.</p>

Instead of being limited to the default set of reactions that we started with, the latest Signal updates for Android, Desktop, and iOS let you react with even more emoji.</p>

<p>Signal iOS now includes a new feature that makes it possible to switch to a brand-new iPhone or iPad while securely transferring Signal information from your existing iOS device. As with every new Signal feature, the process is end-to-end encrypted and <a href="/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/">designed to protect your privacy</a>. Transfers also occur over a local connection (similar to AirDrop), so even large migrations can be completed quickly.</p>

<p>In the midst of world-wide protests against racism and police brutality, a lot of people are becoming more immediately aware and concerned about the security of their data and online communication. We’ve gotten a lot of questions at Signal over the past week, so we wanted to briefly recap how it is that we’ve designed Signal, and how we think about concepts like privacy, security, and trust.</p>
