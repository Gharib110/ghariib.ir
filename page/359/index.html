		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Asymptotically Optimal Adaptive Asynchronous Common Coin and DKG with Silent Setup</strong><br>
<em>Hanwen Feng, Qiang Tang</em></p>
<p>This paper presents the first optimal-resilient, adaptively secure asynchronous common coin protocol with $O(lambda n^2)$ communication complexity and $O(1)$ rounds, requiring only a public silent setup. Our protocol immediately implies a sequence of quadratic-communication, constant-round asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols and asynchronous distributed key generation with a silent setup. Along the way, we formulate a new primitive called asynchronous subset alignment and introduce a simple framework to reason about specific composition security suitable for asynchronous common coin, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p>When someone passed me hundreds of thousands of records on kids taken from CloudPets a few years ago, I had a nightmare of a time getting in touch with the company. They&rsquo;d left a MongoDB instance exposed to the public without a password and someone had snagged all their data. Within the data were references that granted access to voice recordings made by children, stored in an S3 bucket that also had no auth. So, why didn&rsquo;t CloudPets respond to attempts to contact them? Their CEO later explained it very succinctly:</p>

<p>As regular readers will know by now, I’m not real fond of virus call centre scammers. You know, the ones who call you up while you’re making dinner or bathing and kids and tell you they’re from Microsoft and that your PC is infected with blah blah polymorphic blah? There’s a bunch of material on this blog already under the Scam tag where I’ve captured the experience and shared it for fun and education. Thing is, the bloody galahs keep calling me so I worked out a little scenario for them…</p>
