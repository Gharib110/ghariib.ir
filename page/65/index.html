<p>After years of development, we are officially releasing <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/rdsys/">Rdsys 1.0</a>. Although Rdsys has already been the sole mechanism for distributing bridges <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/making-connections-from-bridgedb-to-rdsys/">since it replaced BridgeDB last October</a>, this version 1.0 milestone officially marks its new status.</p>
<p>We now consider Rdsys stable, but our work is far from finished. We are committed to improving Rdsys and fixing issues as they arise, and to adapting quickly to censors&rsquo; evolving tactics.</p>
