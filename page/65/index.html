<p>Was your 3D printer working fine over the summer, and now it’s not? With colder temperatures comes an overall surge in print failure reports — particularly with resin-based printers that might reside in outbuildings, basements, or garages. If you think this applies to you, don’t miss [Jan Mrázek]’s tips on improving cold-weather print results. His tips target the main reasons prints fail, helping to make the process a little more resilient overall. [Jan]’s advice is the product of long experience and experimentation, so don’t miss out.</p>

		<p>SentinelLABS has observed an active phishing campaign targeting high-profile X accounts to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</li>
<li>This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.</li>
<li>SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at <a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com">ThreatTips@sentinelone.com</a>.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Much of the current discourse around cyber threat actors&rsquo; misuse of AI is confined to theoretical research. While these studies demonstrate the potential for malicious exploitation of AI, they don&rsquo;t necessarily reflect the reality of how AI is currently being used by threat actors in the wild. To bridge this gap, we are sharing a comprehensive analysis of how threat actors interacted with Google&rsquo;s AI-powered assistant, Gemini. Our analysis was grounded by the expertise of Google&rsquo;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), which combines decades of experience tracking threat actors on the front lines and protecting Google, our users, and our customers from government-backed attackers, targeted 0-day exploits, coordinated information operations (IO), and serious cyber crime networks.</p>

<p>AI is advancing at lightning speed, but it’s also raising some big questions, especially when it comes to security. The latest AI making headlines is DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that’s shaking up the game with its cost-efficient, high-performing models. But it’s also raising red flags for cybersecurity pros.</p>
<p>DeepSeek overnight became a top contender, mostly driven by curiosity. It’s being praised for its efficiency, with models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 performing at a fraction of the cost and energy usage compared to competitors, being trained on Nvidia&rsquo;s lower-power H800 chips.</p>
