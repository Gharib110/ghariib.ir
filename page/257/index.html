Take a break from avoiding your New Year’s resolutions and join us as we review the details of their latest security alerts. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>

<p>If you’ve ever gazed at the shoreline of Santos, Brazil, and felt like something was tugging at your inner eye level, you’re not alone. In fact, you’ve spotted one of the world’s most bizarre architectural phenomena.</p>
<p>Santos is an interesting contradiction—it’s a sunny coastal city with pristine beaches that also plays host to a bustling port. What draws the eye, however, is the skyline—it’s decidedly askew. This isn’t a Photoshop job or some avant-garde urban planning experiment, either. It’s a consequence of engineering hubris, poor planning, and geology just doing its thing.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>The Meta-Complexity of Secret Sharing</strong><br>
<em>Benny Applebaum, Oded Nir</em></p>
<p>A secret-sharing scheme allows the distribution of a secret $s$ among $n$ parties, such that only certain predefined “authorized” sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, while all other “unauthorized” sets learn nothing about $s$. The collection of authorized/unauthorized sets is defined by a monotone function $f: {0,1}^n rightarrow {0,1}$. It is known that any monotone function can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme; thus, the smallest achievable emph{total share size}, $S(f)$, serves as a natural complexity measure. In this paper, we initiate the study of the following meta-complexity question: Given a monotone function $f$, is it possible to efficiently distinguish between cases where the secret-sharing complexity of $f$ is small versus large? We examine this question across several computational models, yielding the following main results.</p>

<p>The era of artificial intelligence everything is here, and with it, come everyday surprises into exactly where the next AI tools might pop up.</p>
<p>There are major corporations pushing customer support functions onto AI chatbots, Big Tech platforms offering AI image generation for social media posts, and even Google has defaulted to include AI-powered overviews into everyday searches.</p>
<p>The next gold rush, it seems, is in AI, and for a group of technical and legal researchers at New York University and Cornell University, that could be a major problem.</p>

		<p>Businesses rely heavily on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for seamless communication and data exchange, the stakes have never been higher. API breaches can lead to significant vulnerabilities, affecting not only the targeted organization but also their customers and partners. Understanding the causes and consequences of these breaches is essential for any business operating in a connected world.</p>

</p>
<p>High-profile incidents, such as the T-Mobile and Dropbox API breaches, have demonstrated the ripple effect these security lapses can have across various industries, from financial services to healthcare and e-commerce. The repercussions can be devastating, ranging from substantial financial losses to lasting damage to an organization’s reputation. As companies navigate this complex landscape, they must recognize that an API breach is much more than just a technical issue—it can alter the course of a business’s future.</p>

<p>There are simply too many laptops to choose from if you&rsquo;re in the market for something new. Of course, we&rsquo;d recommend some of the best laptops available, but if the prices aren&rsquo;t within your budget, there&rsquo;s a good chance that this one from MSI will be. The Summit E16 AI Studio not only looks good, but also has a large screen and powerful internals as well.</p>

Window snapping GNOME extension Tiling Shell —not that you need an introduction to it by now— adds a nifty new feature in its latest update. Tiling Shell v16 introduces Windows Suggestions, a feature the add-on’s author described as being able to “provide intelligent recommendations for other windows to tile, making window management smoother and more intuitive.” Per the GIF below, placing a window in a tile using the tiling system results in on-screen suggestions for other windows to tile in the the remaining gaps. If too many windows are open (so suggestions don’t fit within the available space) it’s scrollable. […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Time-Lock Puzzles from Lattices</strong><br>
<em>Shweta Agrawal, Giulio Malavolta, Tianwei Zhang</em></p>
<p>Time-lock puzzles (TLP) are a cryptographic tool that allow one to encrypt a message into the future, for a predetermined amount of time $T$. At present, we have only two constructions with provable security: One based on the repeated squaring assumption and the other based on obfuscation. Basing TLP on any other assumption is a long-standing question, further motivated by the fact that known constructions are broken by quantum algorithms.</p>

		<p><em>Warning: extremely wonky cryptography post. Also, possibly stupid and bound for nowhere.</em></p>
<p>One of the hardest problems in applied cryptography (and perhaps all of computer science!) is explaining <em>why</em> our tools work the way they do. After all, we’ve been gifted an amazing basket of useful algorithms from those who came before us. Hence it’s perfectly understandable for practitioners to want to take those gifts and simply start to apply them. But sometimes this approach leaves us wondering <em>why</em> we’re doing certain things: in these cases it’s helpful to take a step back and think about what’s actually going on, and perhaps what was in the inventors’ heads when the tools were first invented.</p>

		<p><em>This post continues a long, wonky discussion of Schnorr signature schemes and the Dilithium post-quantum signature. You may want to start with Part 1.</em></p>
<p>In the previous post I discussed the intuition behind Schnorr signatures, beginning with a high-level design rationale and ending with a concrete instantiation.</p>
<p>As a reminder: our discussion began with this Tweet by Chris Peikert:</p>

<p>Which we eventually developed into an abstract version of the Schnorr protocol that uses Chris’s “magic boxes” to realize part of its functionality:</p>
