		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Shuffle Shamir Secret Shares Uniformly with Linear Online Communication</strong><br>
<em>Jiacheng Gao, Yuan Zhang, Sheng Zhong</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we revisit shuffle protocol for Shamir secret sharing. Upon examining previous works, we observe that existing constructions either produce non-uniform shuffle or require large communication and round complexity, e.g. exponential in the number of parties. We propose two shuffle protocols, both of which shuffle uniformly within $O(frac{k + l}{log k}n^2mlog m)$ communication for shuffling rows of an $mtimes l$ matrix shared among $n$ parties, where $kleq m$ is a parameter balancing communication and computation. Our first construction is more concretely efficient, while our second construction requires only $O(nml)$ online communication within $O(n)$ round. In terms of overall communication and online communication, both shuffle protocols outperform current optimal shuffle protocols for Shamir secret sharing. At the core of our constructions is a novel permutation-sharing technique, which can be used to permute arbitrarily many vectors by computing matrix-vector products. Once shared, applying a permutation becomes much cheaper, which results in a faster online phase. Letting each party share one secret uniform permutation in the offline phase and applying them sequentially in the online phase, we obtain our first shuffle protocol. To further optimize online complexity and simplify the trade-off, we adopt the shuffle correlation proposed by Gao et al. and obtain the second shuffle protocol with $O(nml)$ online communication and $O(n^2ml)$ online computation. This brings an additional benefit that the online complexity is now independent of offline complexity, which reduces parameter optimization to optimizing offline efficiency.</p>

		<p>An online shop is more than just another way to sell your products. It comes with a responsibility to keep the web shop secure.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are looking to steal your customers’ credit card details, their personal data, and even your revenue.</p>
<p>And it’s not as if using a platform that is used by major retailers makes it safe. Platforms like Shopify, Wix, and Magento are always under scrutiny of cybercriminals that are looking for a vulnerability that allows them to insert skimmers or get access to your database.</p>

		<p>Last year while attending Febraban Tech 2024, a financial services industry event in LATAM, we were intrigued to learn that 96% of surveyed banks have artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. We wondered–how many banks are actually taking advantage of AI initiatives? And, how can FSIs take advantage of what small language models have to offer? And, can these advantages apply beyond the world of financial services?What are small language models?A key aspect of an AI model is the quantity of parameters that are used to train a given model. When exploring models, you’ll find this number to b</p>

		<p>Attacks on supply chains were one of the biggest threats in 2024. We discuss the most notable incidents of last year, and their consequences for the attacked.</p>
<p>A supply-chain attack can totally thwart all a targeted company’s efforts to protect its infrastructure. Preventing such attacks is extremely difficult because a significant portion of an attack occurs in infrastructure that’s not within the security team’s control. This makes supply-chain attacks one of the most dangerous threats in recent years, and today we’ll look at some of the biggest that took place in 2024.</p>

		<p>Last month, we focused on how building high-performing teams is a key differentiator of organizational success. Paramount to long-term success is the ability of your employees and teams to continuously learn, adapt, and innovate—what many have called a learning culture or culture of continuous learning.</p>
<p>As the guidance paper “How to Thrive (or Fail) in Building a Learning Culture” states, “Organizations that cultivate a culture of learning possess a distinct competitive advantage—one that allows them to stay ahead of the curve, anticipate shifts in the market, and deliver exceptional value to customers.”</p>

<p>Healthcare systems in high-income countries are at breaking point. An ageing population, soaring demand for services, and widespread burnout among professionals have created a perfect storm.</p>
<p>According to a report by BMJ Global Health, it is estimated that 13.7 million new health workers will be needed by 2030 globally to compensate for attrition due to retirements.</p>
