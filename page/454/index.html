	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Establishing and maintaining an effective security and governance posture has never been more important for enterprises. This post explains how you, as a security administrator, can use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enforce resource configurations in a manner that is designed to be secure, scalable, and primarily focused on feature gating.</p>
<p>In this context, _feature gatin_g means that newly supported AWS features and configurations can’t be used unless you explicitly approve them. With feature gating, you maintain control over your AWS environment when new services and capabilities are introduced.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by <strong>list</strong> requests.</p>
<p>In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes <strong>list</strong> requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple <strong>list</strong> requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let&rsquo;s consider the below graph.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Managing log data efficiently has become both a necessity and a challenge.<br>
Log data, ranging from network traffic and access records to application errors, is essential to cybersecurity operations,<br>
yet the sheer volume and complexity can easily overwhelm even the most seasoned analysts. AI-driven log analysis promises<br>
to lighten this burden by automating initial data reviews and detecting anomalies. But beyond automation, an ideal AI<br>
solution should foster a partnership with analysts, supporting and enhancing their intuitive insights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Controlling and managing plugins across various browsers and email clients is crucial for maintaining a secure enterprise environment. This blog post will explore how to effectively manage these plugins using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in an Active Directory (AD) setting, aligning with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls Version 8.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-plugin-management">The Importance of Plugin Management</h2>
<p>CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets emphasizes the need to actively manage all software on the network. This includes plugins for browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and email clients such as Outlook, which can be potential vectors for security breaches if left unmanaged.</p>
