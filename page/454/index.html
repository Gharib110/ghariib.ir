		<p>Apple has released security patches for most of its operating systems, including iOS, Mac, iPadOS, Safari, and visionOS.</p>
<p>To check if you’re using the latest software version, go to <strong>Settings</strong> (or <strong>System Settings</strong>) &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Software Update</strong>. It’s also worth turning on Automatic Updates if you haven’t already, which you can do on the same screen.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Remember when securing your network meant throwing up a firewall and calling it a day? Well, the cellular network industry has evolved, and so have the threats. A decade back, UScellular’s quest for IT security solutions ignited a long-standing partnership with Palo Alto Networks. Now, UScellular and Palo Alto Networks are teaming up once again to tackle the ever-growing security challenges of LTE, 5G and Gi-LAN networks.</p>
<p>What’s the twist? Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) go beyond the internet perimeter, providing comprehensive visibility and real-time threat mitigation for both UScellular’s high-capacity network interfaces and its customers. This isn’t just about throwing hardware at the issue. Palo Alto Networks leverages its innovative Zero Trust approach, a security framework that extends beyond the traditional network edge to bring best-in-class security to business- and mission-critical applications in 5G environments.</p>

If you’ve ever played around with customising Ubuntu (or any GNOME Shell-based Linux distribution) you’ll have encountered GNOME Tweaks, an official app giving you GUI access to options, settings, and controls not otherwise exposed in the UI. In recent years, GNOME’s developers have begun migrating settings out of GNOME Tweaks and into the desktop proper — a move which refutes that oft-opined claim that GNOME only removes options, never adds them. But we (as users) can’t expect GNOME to cover and cater to every whim, want and wish. It pulls engineers and developers away from working on arguably more important […]</p>

<strong>Experts: New Mandates Could Be Difficult, Costly for Many Entities</strong><br>
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; proposed overhaul of the 20-plus-year-old HIPAA Security Rule aims to drastically improve the state of healthcare sector cybersecurity, but the potential new requirements could mean difficult and expensive heavy lifting for many regulated entities.</p>

		<p>Attacks on encrypted file storage: how to choose a safe alternative to Dropbox or OneDrive</p>
<p>No one can deny the convenience of cloud file-storage services like Dropbox or OneDrive. The one drawback is that cybercriminals, intelligence agencies, or the hosting provider itself can view your cloud-based files without authorization. But there’s a more secure alternative: encrypted cloud file-storage. Some call it end-to-end encryption (E2EE) — similar to Signal and WhatsApp. According to the marketing blurb, files are encrypted on your device and sent to the cloud already in secure form — the encryption key remaining in your possession and no one else’s. Not even the provider can sniff this information. But is that really the case?</p>
