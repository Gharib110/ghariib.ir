	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The debate over in-office versus remote work misses a fundamental truth: high-performing teams succeed based on how they’re organized, not where they sit. Through extensive research across industries, Gene Kim and Dr. Steven J. Spear found that three key mechanisms consistently enable team excellence: slowing down to speed up, breaking down complexity, and amplifying problems early.</p>
<p>As they explain in their award-winning book <em>Wiring the Winning Organization</em>, the leaders of the highest-performing teams will use these three simple mechanisms to “wire their organization for success instead of mediocrity.” </p>

<p>A key learning from the outage caused by the faulty CrowdStrike “Rapid Response” update is how critical it is to understand your vendors’ quality control and release processes. Vendors should not only offer advanced technology to fulfill a business requirement but also demonstrate a strong commitment to reliability, security, and customer support.</p>
<p>A variety of events and circumstances can cause an outage. This blog will suggest five areas to consider and questions to ask when evaluating your existing vendors and their risk management strategies.</p>
