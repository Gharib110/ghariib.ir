		<p>Cybersecurity threats are multiplying with each passing year. They are growing more sophisticated, as shown by the continued success enjoyed by ransomware and other scams. Two-factor authentication is a time-tested way to minimize the threat of a breach and protect the organization as well as the individual from attacks.

<p>Some retro games need a little help running on modern systems, and it’s not always straightforward. <em>SimCity 2000 Special Edition</em> is one such game and [araxestroy]’s sc2kfix bugfix DLL shows that the process can require a nontrivial amount of skill and finesse. The result? A <em>SimCity 2000 Special Edition</em> that can run without crash or compromise on modern Windows machines, surpassing previous fixes.</p>
<p><em>SimCity 2000 Special Edition</em> was a release for Windows 95 that allowed the game to work in windowed glory. The executable is capable of running under modern Windows systems (and at high resolutions!) but it’s got a few problems lurking under the hood.</p>

		<p>Attacks with the chained vulnerabilities have been thwarted by three organizations, with the first preventing compromise following sysadmin identification of suspicious user accounts and the second averting the breach after an endpoint protection platform detected web shell-creating base64-encoded scripts, according to a joint CISA and FBI advisory.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has been working on a smaller Surface Pro for a while, and it seems to finally be happening in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Microsoft is reportedly preparing to launch smaller versions of the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop in the near future, and they could be launching sooner than you think. The company had already been reported to be working on a smaller Surface Pro last year, but plans for that seemingly fell through, as the Surface Pro 11 launched in the same 13-inch size as always.</p>

		<p>Learn how to modernize legacy code with GitHub Copilot with real-world examples.</p>
<p>The post Modernizing legacy code with GitHub Copilot: Tips and examples appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about legacy code—you know, the code that’s old enough to drive and definitely old enough to haunt your dreams. Maybe it’s a sprawling COBOL system or an early version of C++ written back when “Y2K” was a serious concern. Now, decades later, you’re being asked to “look into it” and modernize it (while wondering if you need to send a note to that person who retired a few years ago and may know how this thing works).</p>

<p>As more organizations embrace DevOps and CI/CD pipelines, GitHub-hosted runners and GitHub Actions have emerged as powerful tools for automating workflows. But as with many other automation tools, it can be difficult to maintain the performance and visibility of these workflows. That’s where Dynatrace business events and automation workflows come into play to provide a comprehensive view of your CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of the advantages of monitoring GitHub runners using Dynatrace.</p>
