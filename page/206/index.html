<p>Recently, CNCERT and 360netlab worked together and discovered a rapidly spreading DDoS botnet on the Internet. The global infection looks fairly big as just in China there are more than 10,000 daily active bots (IPs) and alsomore than 100 DDoS victims beingtargeted on a daily basis. We named the botnet Fodcha because of its initial use of the C2 domain name folded.in and its use of the chacha algorithm to encrypt network traffic.</p>

<p>As 2024 ended, a new name surged to the top of the cyber threat charts: FunkSec. Emerging as a leading ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor, FunkSec made waves in December by publishing over 85 victim profiles on its Data Leak Site (DLS). However, beneath its apparent dominance lies a more complex and controversial story, as uncovered in Check Point Research’s (CPR) Global Threat Index for December 2024. FunkSec’s rapid ascent highlights the evolving tactics of RaaS operators. Utilizing artificial intelligence to scale operations, the group appears to rely heavily on AI-powered tools to generate ransomware and manage its double-extortion campaigns. While this […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Further Improvements in AES Execution over TFHE: Towards Breaking the 1 sec Barrier</strong><br>
<em>Sonia Belaïd, Nicolas Bon, Aymen Boudguiga, Renaud Sirdey, Daphné Trama, Nicolas Ye</em></p>
<p>Making the most of TFHE advanced capabilities such as programmable or circuit bootstrapping and their generalizations for manipulating data larger than the native plaintext domain of the scheme is a very active line of research. In this context, AES is a particularly interesting benchmark, as an example of a nontrivial algorithm which has eluded ``practical&rsquo;&rsquo; FHE execution performances for years, as well as the fact that it will most likely be selected by NIST as a flagship reference in its upcoming call on threshold (homomorphic) cryptography. Since 2023, the algorithm has thus been the subject of a renewed attention from the FHE community and has served as a playground to test advanced operators following the LUT-based, $p$-encodings or several variants of circuit bootstrapping, each time leading to further timing improvements. Still, AES is also interesting as a benchmark because of the tension between boolean- and byte-oriented operations within the algorithm. In this paper, we resolve this tension by proposing a new approach, coined ``hippo&rsquo;&rsquo;, which consistently combines the (byte-oriented) LUT-based approach with a generalization of the (boolean-oriented) $p$-encodings one to get the best of both worlds. In doing so, we obtain the best timings so far, getting a single-core execution of the algorithm over TFHE from $46$ down to $32$ seconds and approaching the $1$ second barrier with only a mild amount of parallelism. We should also stress that all the timings reported in this paper are consistently obtained on the same machine which is often not the case in previous studies. Lastly, we emphasize that the techniques we develop are applicable beyond just AES since the boolean-byte tension is a recurrent issue when running algorithms over TFHE.</p>

<p>On Oct 21, 2022, 360Netlab&rsquo;s honeypot system captured a suspicious ELF file <code>ee07a74d12c0bb3594965b51d0e45b6f</code>, which propagated via F5 vulnerability with zero VT detection, our system observces that it communicates with IP <code>45.9.150.144</code> using SSL with <strong>forged Kaspersky certificates</strong>, this caught our attention. After further lookup, we confirmed that this sample was adapted from the leaked Hive project server source code from CIA. <strong>This is the first time we caught a variant of the CIA HIVE attack kit in the wild</strong>, and we named it <code>xdr33</code> based on its embedded Bot-side certificate <code>CN=xdr33</code>.</p>

<p>In an increasingly globalized world, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) often find themselves navigating a maze of visa rules, travel guidelines, and cultural adjustments across different countries. While the internet offers a wealth of information, it can often be scattered, outdated, or irrelevant to specific NRI needs. Enter <strong>Desi NRI</strong>, a platform that has been transforming the way NRIs access critical information, share experiences, and make informed decisions about travel, visas, and much more.</p>

<p>There are so many AI models to choose from these days. From the proprietary foundation models of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to the smaller, more open options from the likes of Meta and Mistral. It’s tempting to hop immediately to the latest models. But just because a model is newer doesn’t mean it will perform better for your use case.</p>

		<p>Who claimed quantum supremacy and decryption on quantum computers?</p>
<p>Quantum computers remain a highly exotic technology, used by a very small number of companies for very specific computational tasks. But if you search for “quantum computer news”, you might get the impression that all the major IT players have already armed themselves with quantum technology, and that any day now hackers will start using it to crack encrypted communications and manipulate digital signatures. The reality is both less tense and more complex — but such nuances don’t make the headlines. So, who’s been making all the noise about quantum hacking?…</p>

		<p>With the right hardware and OS, even a Raspberry Pi can serve as solid daily driver</p>
<p>Over the years, SBCs have seen significant improvements in both processing capabilities and software compatibility. Modern-day Single-Board Computers have become versatile enough to power a wide variety of projects. This trend also extends to the Raspberry Pi series, with the RPi 5 packing enough firepower to run full-fledged desktop operating systems.</p>
