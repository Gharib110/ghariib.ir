<p>As we move into 2025, we wanted to reflect on the crowning event of the year: the Ubuntu Summit. Just over two months ago, we celebrated Ubuntu’s 20th birthday in The Hague, the Netherlands. We’re still buzzing from the electric atmosphere you all brought to this event, as we came together to showcase what open source excellence should look like.</p>
<p>As we reached an important milestone, we set ourselves an ambitious goal for the summit. We wanted it to be an event which celebrated all of the experts, builders, engineers and tinkerers who are challenging the status quo and doing exciting, amazing things in open source. We were delighted that so many of you answered the call and helped transform our vision into a reality.</p>

<p>On March the 31st, I gave a quick talk on automotive security at VTM titled &ldquo;<strong>UN ECE 155 Threats in the real world: Wireless Networking Attacks and Mitigations. A case study</strong>&rdquo; (slides here).</p>
<p>The idea was to create some content about one of the <em>most hyped topics</em> in the automotive cyber security world over the last year, without keeping it just theoretical;</p>
<p>UN/ECE 155 and ISO/SAE 21434 whose concerns are about the implementation of a CSMS (Cyber Security Management System) which consists in performing, for each vehicle, several high level security tasks, such as Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA), supply chain security issues tracking, implementation of the mitigations, update management and so on.</p>

<p>Unicode is the de-facto standard for multilingual character encoding. UTF-8 is the most popular encoding used that supports its hundreds of thousands of characters. Aside from the encoding (byte representation of characters), Unicode defines multiple transformations that can be applied to characters. For instance, it describes the behavior of transformations such as Uppercase.</p>
<p>The character known as Long S “ſ” (U+017F) will become a regular uppercase S “S” (U+0053). Unexpected behavior for developers can often lead to security issues. Today, we will dive into the case mapping and normalization transformations. You will see how they can contribute to logic flaws in code.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it Unity developers — you write buggy code. <strong>I write buggy code</strong>. <strong><em>AI writes buggy code</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Many software engineers consider unit testing as the key to catching bugs early and preventing regressions. But do they work for Unity developers?</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll share with you how we do testing at Virtual Maker. We&rsquo;ll learn the difference between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, and why I think you should avoid writing the latter.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a project led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that allows security professionals to express control-related information in machine-readable formats. Expressing compliance information in this way allows security practitioners to use automated tools to support data analysis, while making it easier to address downstream requirements such as translation and accessibility. In the United States, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has collaborated closely with NIST and the FedRAMP program to advance the adoption of OSCAL, and was the first cloud service provider to submit a FedRAMP system security plan (SSP) in OSCAL format in 2022.</p>

VirtualBox 7.1.6 is out, the third maintenance release to the VirtualBox 7.1 stable series first released in September of last year. Headline offering in this update is initial support for the recently released Linux kernel 6.13 in Linux Guest Additions, plus improved support for the Linux 6.4 kernel to fix graphics freezing when using VBoxVGA adapter, and Linux 6.12 fixes for vboxvideo. Linux guest screens no longer flicker when using VMSVGA graphics adapters, Windows 11 24H2 guests no longer throw BSODs, and entering a custom proxy server in a guest OS’ settings will now take effect, which some will be […]</p>
