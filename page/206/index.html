		<p>What is the Medusa ransomware? Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform that first came to prominence in 2023. The ransomware impacts organisations running Windows, predominantly exploiting vulnerable and unpatched systems and hijacking accounts through initial access brokers. Initial access brokers? Initial access brokers (IABs) specialise in gaining unauthorised access to the networks of organisations, and then sell that access to other cybercriminals - such as ransomware gangs like Medusa. So the ransomware attackers may not be the ones who initially hacked you? Correct. IABs may&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="briefly-what-is-the-problem">Briefly, what is the problem?</h2>
<p>Extremely summarizing, mobile applications need to implement screenshot prevention mechanisms in order to avoid an attacker to steal sensitive data, such as credentials or private information, that are shown on the screen during the application execution.</p>

<p>The following article will explain how to test mobile applications against any implemented screenshot prevention mechanism and then it will try to propose mitigations to such problem according to the context.</p>
<p>The following article is the second part of <strong>Mobile Screenshot Prevention Cheat Sheet - Risks and Scenarios</strong> published on IMQ Minded Security blog.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>; None of the proposed solutions will provide a full protection against screenshotting. Therefore all of them shall be considered as mitigations.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Compile time does not get as much attention as it once did. Fast machines and compile farms with thousands of machines make time spent compiling seem less important than ever. Most modern priorities are for the program to either run fast or have a small footprint—sometimes both. That does not mean we should ignore compile time. The compiler builds itself, so in some respects compile time is a reflection of how well it generates runtime code.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Multi-Key Homomorphic Secret Sharing</strong><br>
<em>Geoffroy Couteau, Lalita Devadas, Aditya Hegde, Abhishek Jain, Sacha Servan-Schreiber</em></p>
<p>Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) is a distributed analogue of fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE), where subsequent to an input-sharing phase, parties can locally compute a function over their shares to obtain shares of the function output.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, HSS schemes have been constructed from an array of different assumptions. However, all schemes require a public-key or correlated-randomness setup. This limitation carries over to the applications of HSS.</p>

	<b><time>22.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In mid-November 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the Russian threat actor we track as Star Blizzard sending their typical targets spear-phishing messages, this time offering the supposed opportunity to join a WhatsApp group. This is the first time we have identified a shift in Star Blizzard’s longstanding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to leverage a new access vector. Star Blizzard’s targets are most commonly related to government or diplomacy (both incumbent and former position holders), defense policy or international relations researchers whose work touches on Russia, and sources of assistance to Ukraine related to the war with Russia.</p>

		<p>Initial compromise with Nnice ransomware enables not only the exfiltration of credentials, web session cookies, and emails and the identification of security software but also the escalation of privileges, attainment of boot-level persistence, and encryption of files with the &ldquo;.xdddd&rdquo; extension, according to an investigation by the CYFIRMA Research and Advisory team.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Non-Interactive Distributed Point Functions</strong><br>
<em>Elette Boyle, Lalita Devadas, Sacha Servan-Schreiber</em></p>
<p>Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) are a useful cryptographic primitive enabling a dealer to distribute short keys to two parties, such that the keys encode additive secret shares of a secret point function. However, in many applications of DPFs, no single dealer entity has full knowledge of the secret point function, necessitating the parties to run an interactive protocol to emulate the setup. Prior works have aimed to minimize complexity metrics of such distributed setup protocols, e.g., round complexity, while remaining black-box in the underlying cryptography.</p>
