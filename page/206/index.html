<p>Unicode is the de-facto standard for multilingual character encoding. UTF-8 is the most popular encoding used that supports its hundreds of thousands of characters. Aside from the encoding (byte representation of characters), Unicode defines multiple transformations that can be applied to characters. For instance, it describes the behavior of transformations such as Uppercase.</p>
<p>The character known as Long S “ſ” (U+017F) will become a regular uppercase S “S” (U+0053). Unexpected behavior for developers can often lead to security issues. Today, we will dive into the case mapping and normalization transformations. You will see how they can contribute to logic flaws in code.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it Unity developers — you write buggy code. <strong>I write buggy code</strong>. <strong><em>AI writes buggy code</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Many software engineers consider unit testing as the key to catching bugs early and preventing regressions. But do they work for Unity developers?</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll share with you how we do testing at Virtual Maker. We&rsquo;ll learn the difference between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, and why I think you should avoid writing the latter.</p>

		<p>The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a project led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that allows security professionals to express control-related information in machine-readable formats. Expressing compliance information in this way allows security practitioners to use automated tools to support data analysis, while making it easier to address downstream requirements such as translation and accessibility. In the United States, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has collaborated closely with NIST and the FedRAMP program to advance the adoption of OSCAL, and was the first cloud service provider to submit a FedRAMP system security plan (SSP) in OSCAL format in 2022.</p>

VirtualBox 7.1.6 is out, the third maintenance release to the VirtualBox 7.1 stable series first released in September of last year. Headline offering in this update is initial support for the recently released Linux kernel 6.13 in Linux Guest Additions, plus improved support for the Linux 6.4 kernel to fix graphics freezing when using VBoxVGA adapter, and Linux 6.12 fixes for vboxvideo. Linux guest screens no longer flicker when using VMSVGA graphics adapters, Windows 11 24H2 guests no longer throw BSODs, and entering a custom proxy server in a guest OS’ settings will now take effect, which some will be […]</p>

<p>It might occur that companies discover vulnerabilities on web application assets that were acquired by <em>third party vendors</em>.</p>
<p>What happens if the asset is no longer supported/licensed and cannot be promptly <em>updated</em> by the organization?</p>
<p>A viable option is by using a <em>Web Application Firewall</em> (WAF) component using a <em><strong>custom developed rule</strong></em> to block attempts to exploit specific vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Even though this behavior might <em>not</em> be the definitive solution, it allows a company to buy time to figure out how to correctly patch or, perhaps, replace the vulnerable asset.</p>

<p>Unicode-related vulnerabilities have seen an increase in momentum in the past year. Last year, a Black Hat presentation by Jonathan Birch detailed how character normalization NFC/NFKC can lead to glitches in URL and host manipulation. Recently, two vulnerabilities were found in password reset functionality. The two affected applications were Django and Github. In the previous blog post, we have presented API transforming code points with potential side effects. In this post, we present one of our findings: a vulnerability affecting Oracle JDK and Open JDK host verification in the TLS communication. We are also including details from a similar weakness in Apache HTTP client.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m honest, I was in two minds about adding additional stealer logs to HIBP. Even with the new feature to include the domains an email address appears against in the logs, my concern was that I&rsquo;d get a barrage of &ldquo;that&rsquo;s useless information&rdquo; messages like I normally do when I load stealer logs! Instead, the feedback was resoundingly positive. This week I&rsquo;m talking more about the logic behind this, some of the challenges we faced with it and what we might see in the future. Stay tuned, because I think we&rsquo;re going to be seeing a lot more of this in HIBP.</p>
