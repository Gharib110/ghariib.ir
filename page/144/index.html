<p>Deepfakes are no longer just the stuff of sci-fi thrillers—they’re here, and they’re deceptively good. From celebrity endorsements to real-time impersonations, deepfake technology has advanced to the point where spotting one isn’t as easy as it used to be.</p>

<em>Minghang Li, Qianhong Wu, Zhipeng Wang, Bo Qin, Bohang Wei, Hang Ruan, Shihong Xiong, Zhenyang Ding</em></p>
<p>BFT protocols usually have a waterfall-like degradation in performance in the face of crash faults. Some BFT protocols may not experience sudden performance degradation under crash faults. They achieve this at the expense of increased communication and round complexity in fault-free scenarios. In a nutshell, existing protocols lack the adaptability needed to perform optimally under varying conditions.</p>

		<p>Edge computing is revolutionizing how organizations process and analyze data by bringing computation closer to data sources, but this transformation introduces unique challenges in maintaining visibility and control across distributed environments. In this article we explore how Red Hat OpenShift&rsquo;s integrated observability capabilities address these challenges while helping maintain predictable costs and operational efficiency.1.

<p>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are the subject of an emerging field in semiconductor research, with these materials offering a range of useful properties that include not only semiconductor applications, but also in superconducting material research and in supercapacitors. A recent number of papers have been published on these latter two applications, with [Rui] et al. demonstrating superconductivity in (InSe2)_x_NbSe2. The superconducting transition occurred at 11.6 K with ambient pressure.</p>

		<p>UnitedHealth says it now estimates that the data breach on its subsidiary Change Healthcare affected 190 million people, nearly doubling its previous estimate from October.</p>
<p>In May, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty estimated that the ransomware attack compromised the data of a third of US individuals when he testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill. In October, this was largely confirmed when Change Healthcare reported a number of 100,000,000 affected individuals.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At the heart of every smart factory initiative lies a desire for transformation — production that&rsquo;s not just more efficient, but fundamentally better. Yet according to Capgemini, nearly 60% of manufacturers struggle to scale beyond pilot projects, finding themselves in what McKinsey calls &ldquo;pilot purgatory&rdquo; — that frustrating space between successful small-scale tests and full-scale transformation.</p>
<p>The key to breaking free from pilot purgatory lies in the foundation of smart manufacturing: infrastructure. For manufacturers pushing to innovate and stay competitive, the technical challenges are clear. Success demands robust infrastructure that can handle automation, process real-time data, and run sophisticated AI workloads. Yet as Gartner notes, &ldquo;Technology or solution immaturity is much less of a challenge than many might expect.&rdquo; What matters more is how this infrastructure enables people to work together, make decisions, and drive change across the organization.</p>

		<p>Multiple versions of our on-premises product will reach the end of support on October 14, 2025. Customers are encouraged to start planning and deploying upgrades now to ensure that installed products remain supported and secure, and to take advantage of new capabilities offered in successor products. The latest version of our on-premises product is Azure DevOps Server 2022.2.</p>
<p>October 14, 2025, is the date for the end of Extended Support for Team Foundation Server 2015 – meaning it will no longer receive security updates or technical support. Upon end of support, there will be no new updates, free or paid assisted support options or online technical content updates. Upgrading from Team Foundation Server 2015 to Azure DevOps Server 2022.2 is fully supported and we strongly recommend that customers upgrade to the latest version before October 14, 2025, to continue getting security patches and support.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Today, we released an updated version of the Aligning to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) in the AWS Cloud whitepaper to reflect the significant changes introduced in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, published in February 2024. This comprehensive update helps you understand how AWS services align with the enhanced framework and how you can use AWS capabilities to improve your cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p>The NIST CSF 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. The updated version introduces important changes, including the following:</p>
