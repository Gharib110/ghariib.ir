<p>Hackers and makers have built just about every kind of clock under the sun. Digital, analog, seven-segment, mechanical seven-segment, binary, ternary, hexadecimal… you name it. It’s been done. You really have to try to find something that shocks us… something we haven’t seen before. [Moritz v. Sivers] has done just that. </p>

<p>Meet the Caustic Clock. It’s based on the innovative Hollow Clock from [shiura]. It displays time with an hour hand and a minute hand, and that’s all so conventional. But what really caught our eye was the manner in which its dial works. It uses caustics to display the clock dial on a wall as light shines through it.</p>

<p>“By compromising developer accounts, attackers not only exfiltrate intellectual property but also gain access to cryptocurrency wallets, enabling direct financial theft,” the company said. “The targeted theft of private and secret keys could lead to millions in stolen digital assets, furthering the Lazarus Group’s financial goals.”</p>
<p>The malware architecture adopts a modular design and is flexible, and capable of working across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It also serves to highlight the ever-evolving and adaptable nature of nation-state cyber threats.</p>

The first new kernel release of the year has arrived — yes, Linux 6.13 has gone stable. Linux kernel 6.13 adds, as ever, a vast array of improvements, from an updated Raspberry Pi graphics driver promising speed gains, to lazy preemption logic, expanded Rust support and new drivers for a host of hardware, peripherals and digital doohickeys. Plus, as with all new kernel releases there’s ongoing work to support new and upcoming CPUs and GPUs from industry titans Intel and AMD. Linus Torvalds quietly confirmed the Linux 6.13 release in an email to the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), noting that as […]</p>

		<p>Remote work isn’t just a temporary trend anymore; it has become a permanent fixture. What began as a quick response during the pandemic has evolved into the new normal for businesses worldwide. In America, 20% of people now work from home. While this has its advantages (flexibility for workers and cost savings for businesses), it’s not without its complications, having cracked open a host of issues around cybersecurity and regulatory compliance. To address these challenges, businesses can’t afford to be lax. That means fixing security and compliance for remote work is not as simple as adding&hellip;</p>

<p>Microsoft has shed light on a now-patched security flaw impacting Apple macOS that, if successfully exploited, could have allowed an attacker running as “root” to bypass the operating system’s System Integrity Protection (SIP) and install malicious kernel drivers by loading third-party kernel extensions.</p>
<p>The vulnerability in question is <strong>CVE-2024–44243</strong> (CVSS score: 5.5), a medium-severity bug that was addressed by Apple as part of macOS Sequoia 15.2 released last month. The iPhone maker described it as a “configuration issue” that could permit a malicious app to modify protected parts of the file system.</p>

<p>“Code executed in this early boot phase can persist on the system, potentially loading malicious kernel extensions that survive both reboots and OS reinstallation,” the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) said. “Additionally, it may evade detection by OS-based and endpoint detection and response (EDR) security measures.”</p>
<p>Malicious actors could further expand the scope of exploitation by bringing their own copy of the vulnerable “reloader.efi” binary to any UEFI system with the Microsoft third-party UEFI certificate enrolled. However, elevated privileges are required to deploy the vulnerable and malicious files to the EFI system partition: local administrator on Windows and root on Linux.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><em>Pass by value</em> versus <em>pass by reference</em>, what is it? I was asked this question on my very first tech job interview. I think my answer was that in pass by value a value is passed, while in pass by reference a reference is passed. Yes, this seems like a very basic and shallow answer. However, it is not entirely wrong, but a further explanation is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Pass by value:</strong> The value of a variable is cloned and passed into a function as an argument to a parameter defined in the function. The function is executed and performs various operations with this cloned value. The value of the original variable is <em>UNCHANGED</em>. Almost all known programming languages (including JavaScript and Java), use this.</p>
