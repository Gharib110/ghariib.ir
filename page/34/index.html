		<p>During 2024’s Birthday Week, we launched an AI bot &amp; crawler traffic graph on Cloudflare Radar that provides visibility into which bots and crawlers are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which crawl on a regular basis, and more. Today, we are launching a new dedicated “AI Insights” page on Cloudflare Radar that incorporates this graph and builds on it with additional metrics that you can use to understand AI-related trends from multiple perspectives. In addition to the traffic trends, the new section includes a view into the relative popularity of publicly available Generative AI services based on 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver traffic, the usage of robots.txt directives to restrict AI bot access to content, and open source model usage as seen by Cloudflare Workers AI.</p>

<p>NVIDIA released first Beta of the 570 driver series for Linux users a few days ago. See what’s new in this new driver.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Linux driver introduced VRR support for Wayland since 560 driver series. It’s a feature that adjust the monitor’s refresh rate on the fly, to match the frame rate of output signal from the graphics card.</p>
<p>The feature is useful for games to eliminate screen tearing and also lowers power consumption. And the new 570.86.16 driver enhanced it by supporting <strong>variable refresh rate (VRR) on systems with multiple monitors</strong>.</p>

<p>Implementing Kubernetes securely can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there are tools in the K8s toolshed that provide out-of-the-box solutions using a single click. One such tools is OPA Gatekeeper. It is a great out-of-the-box security checkpoint to enforce security policies on Kubernetes. But are users using it correctly? Do they understand its limitations? Our new research says <strong>not necessarily!</strong></p>

		<p>TL;DR - Red Hat views the minimum criteria for open source AI as open source-licensed model weights combined with open source software components.More than three decades ago, Red Hat saw the potential of how open source development and licenses can create better software to fuel IT innovation. Thirty-million lines of code later, Linux not only developed to become the most successful open source software but the most successful software to date. Our commitment to open source principles continues today, not only in our business model, but in our corporate culture as well. We believe that these c</p>

	<div>
		<p>In our daily lives, we interact with many applications like Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook etc. If we observe carefully, the content loads continuously as we scroll. This seamless experience is achieved using infinite scrolling, a technique that keeps users engaged without interruptions.</p>
<h2 id="why-infinite-scrolling">Why Infinite Scrolling?</h2>
<p>Loading or processing a huge amount of data all at once during page load is not a good idea. It can negatively impact:</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong> – Fetching large amounts of data at once can slow down the application.<br>
<strong>User Experience</strong> – Users might face delays or lag while interacting with the application.</p>
