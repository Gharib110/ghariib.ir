	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The Internet is designed to provide multiple paths between two endpoints. Attempts to exploit multi-path opportunities are almost as old as the Internet, culminating in RFCs documenting some of the challenges. Still, today, virtually all end-to-end communication uses only one available path at a time. Why? It turns out that in multi-path setups, even the smallest differences between paths can harm the connection quality due to packet reordering and other issues. As a result, Internet devices usually use a single path and let the routers handle the path selection.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Ref : <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764">https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764</a></p>
<p>So Meta FAIR&rsquo;s new paper is a banger as always coming from them lol. This one is about increasing model capabilities but with fewer FLOPs spent for the same or more number of parameters basically. What they changed is where the FLOPs (computation in GPU terms , we AI folks like to call it that way).</p>
<p>So in traditional architecture, you got the input converted to a vector representation and the attention heads transforms them to imbue them with context within the input and then this transformed input is passed to the MLP, this is the actual Neural net that has in its parameters the reasoning and memory both encoded. As the input vector passes through each layer, the input is transformed with a bit of reasoning and knowledge that the model learnt during the course of its learning. Then we do this for a bunch of times and in the end the vector represents the next token that should be part of the input. Pretty standard. Neat.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>How the Nearest Neighbor tactic can be used in remote attacks on an organization&rsquo;s wireless network — and how to protect yourself against this threat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of information security, wireless networks are typically perceived as something that can be accessed only locally — to connect to them, an attacker needs to be physically close to the access point. This significantly limits their use in attacks on organizations, and so they are perceived as relatively risk-free. It’s easy to think that some random hacker on the internet could never simply connect to a corporate Wi-Fi network. However, the newly emerged Nearest Neighbor attack tactic demonstrates that this perception is not entirely accurate.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Telco cloud</strong> has evolved from the much hyped (but commercially failed) <strong>NFV/Virtual Network Functions or VNFs</strong> and classical <strong>SDN architectures,</strong> to today’s more robust platforms for <strong>managing virtualized and cloud-native network functions</strong> that are tailored to the needs of telecom network workloads. This shift is bringing many new participants to the rapidly evolving <strong>telco cloud</strong> [<strong>1.]</strong> landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1.</strong>  In this instance, “<strong>telco cloud</strong>” means running telco network functions, including <strong>5G SA Core network</strong> on a public, private, or hybrid cloud platform. It does <strong>NOT</strong> imply that telcos are going to be cloud service providers (CSPs) and compete with Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM, Alibaba and other established CSPs.  Telcos gave up on that years ago and sold most of their own data centers which they intended to make cloud resident.</p>

		<p>On Christmas Eve, 2023, the Ohio State Lottery had to shut down some of its systems because of a cyberattack. Around the same time, the Dark Web had a “Leaksmas” event, where cyber criminals shared stolen information for free as a holiday gift. In fact, the month of December 2023 saw more than 2 billion records breached and 1,351 disclosed security incidents, according to research from IT Governance — an increase of 332% and 187%, respectively, over the month of November.</p>
