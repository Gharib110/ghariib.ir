		<p>Flow Launcher and PowerToys Run can both make the Start menu obsolete on Windows 11. But which one is actually better?</p>
<p>For most people, opening apps with the Start menu and desktop icons works totally fine. But if you&rsquo;re someone who spends a lot of time on the computer and you want to do things as efficiently as possible, a custom launcher becomes almost a necessity as it speeds things up a lot.</p>

<p>111 years ago almost to the day, a murder was committed which ultimately led to the first criminal trial to use fingerprints as evidence. We&rsquo;ve all since watched enough crime shows to understand that fingerprints are unique personal biometric attributes and to date, no two people have ever been found to have a matching set. As technology has evolved, fingers (and palms and irises and faces) have increasingly been used as a means of biometric authentication. I&rsquo;m writing this on a PC that uses a Verifi fingerprint reader. I&rsquo;ll probably continue to draft it from a comfy spot later on using my Lenovo laptop that has a built in reader. I&rsquo;ll also go backwards and forward between my iPhone and iPad with Face ID.</p>

		<p>There are many projects you can power with the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 - here are some examples of what it can do</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5) is a powerful single-board computer that can do almost anything. Unlike regular computers, it is designed to work perfectly with custom hardware, so you can choose how much storage, memory, and wireless power you need. It’s small and can be used in all sorts of cool ways, from building smart home devices to making robots.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t let dust and other particles beat you and your mighty system.</p>
<p>Dust is your PC&rsquo;s worst nightmare. It infiltrates the chassis, lands on a component, and starts to accumulate over time. Too much dust can create a layer of insulation, causing the hardware to run hotter than usual. Clogging up fans could result in less air being forced through vents and the performance of everything inside your PC will be compromised. Luckily, keeping dust outside your PC, or at least keeping on top of the stuff that makes it inside your system, is easier than you may think.</p>

		<p>The electricity grid – the buzzing, crackling marvel that supplies the lifeblood of modernity - is by far the largest structure humanity ever built. It’s so big, in fact, that few people even notice it, like a fish can’t see the ocean.</p>
<p>Until the grid goes down, that is. Then, like the fish dangling from the angler’s hook, we see our vulnerability. Modernity dissolves into a sudden silence, followed by the repeated flick of a light switch, and a howl of panic at the prospect of missed appointmen</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security</strong><br>
<em>Anandarup Roy, Bimal Kumar Roy, Kouichi Sakurai, Suprita Talnikar</em></p>
<p>This article explores the potential of Secret Sharing-Based Internet of Things (SBIoT) as a promising cryptographic element across diverse applications, including secure data storage in commercial cloud systems (Datachest), smart home environments (encompassing sensors, cameras, smart locks, and smart assistants), and e-health applications (protecting patient data and medical records). Beyond these applications, the paper makes two key contributions: the introduction of a novel cheater identification algorithm designed to verify the correct submission of shares during secret reconstruction, and empirical validation through experimental studies to support the theoretical advancements. This multifaceted approach not only demonstrates the versatility of SBIoT but also proposes innovative mechanisms to enhance security and integrity, contributing to the development of a more robust cryptographic framework. This article expands upon the work presented in the poster &ldquo;A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security&rdquo; at IWSEC 2023, Yokohama, Japan.</p>
