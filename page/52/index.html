<p>At its core, Snowflake is a piece of technology that transforms ordinary internet users into censorship-fighting allies. It&rsquo;s as painless and hassle-free as opening a new browser-tab, allowing anyone <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/snowflake-daily-operations/">to open a lifeline for blocked internet users</a>. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve given the <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">Snowflake website</a> a much-needed refresh to make it clearer, more accessible, and easier to navigate.</p>
