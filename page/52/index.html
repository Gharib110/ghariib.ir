		<p>The recent breach of the United States Treasury underscores a stark reality: cyber adversaries are no longer just looking for gaps in traditional network security—they are actively exploiting the tools organizations rely on for daily operations. Remote assistance technologies, essential for IT support and business continuity, have become prime targets for credential theft, moving within the network, and system exploitation. The message is clear: securing remote assistance is no longer optional; it is a fundamental requirement for maintaining operational resilience.  </p>

	<div>
		<p>At Docker, we are committed to ensuring that Docker Hub remains the best place for developers, engineering teams, and operations teams to build, share, and collaborate. As part of this, we previously announced plans to introduce image pull consumption fees and storage-based billing. After further evaluating how developers use Docker Hub and what will best support the ecosystem, we have refined our approach—one that prioritizes developer experience and enables developers to scale with confidence while reinforcing Docker Hub as the foundation of the cloud-native ecosystem.</p>

<p>A piece of musical history is the Maplin 4600, a DIY electronic music synthesizer from the 1970s. The design was published in an Australian electronics magazine and sold as a DIY kit, and [LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER] got his hands on an original Maplin 4600 that he refurbishes and puts through its paces.</p>

		<p>Confidential computing strengthens application security by providing isolation, encryption and attestation so data remains protected while in use. By integrating these security features with a scalable, high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, organizations can adopt a defense-in-depth approach. This is especially critical for regulated industries handling sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and financial information, enabling them to leverage AI with confidence.In this article, we expl</p>

<p>Every day, I talk with security leaders who are navigating a critical balancing act. On one side, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting transformative technologies like generative AI and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other, they’re working to maintain strong security controls and visibility across an increasingly complex landscape. We all know that adding more tools and controls isn’t sustainable. We need a different approach to security at scale.</p>
