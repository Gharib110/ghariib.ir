<p>A piece of musical history is the Maplin 4600, a DIY electronic music synthesizer from the 1970s. The design was published in an Australian electronics magazine and sold as a DIY kit, and [LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER] got his hands on an original Maplin 4600 that he refurbishes and puts through its paces.</p>

		<p>Confidential computing strengthens application security by providing isolation, encryption and attestation so data remains protected while in use. By integrating these security features with a scalable, high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, organizations can adopt a defense-in-depth approach. This is especially critical for regulated industries handling sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and financial information, enabling them to leverage AI with confidence.In this article, we expl</p>

<p>Every day, I talk with security leaders who are navigating a critical balancing act. On one side, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting transformative technologies like generative AI and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other, they’re working to maintain strong security controls and visibility across an increasingly complex landscape. We all know that adding more tools and controls isn’t sustainable. We need a different approach to security at scale.</p>

		<p>It’s exciting to see the continued momentum of 5G in transforming industries. Do you remember when 3G and 4G first came into the picture? They unlocked opportunities for mobile broadband and video streaming. Now, 5G makes it possible for businesses like yours to connect more devices, enhance decision-making, improve operational efficiency and drive growth.</p>
<p>However, the real breakthrough is in the convergence of technologies that are coming together to supercharge 5G business transformation across our most critical infrastructure, industrial businesses and governments. This includes 5G coming of age at the same time as AI, bringing together lightning fast connectivity with intelligence. At the same time, IT and OT are coming together, creating new opportunities for efficiency, productivity and agility between traditionally siloed systems.</p>
