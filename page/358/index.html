<p>Digital quality is integral to the development and rollout of new services. Yet managers and development teams alike often underestimate the value of <strong>quality assurance (QA)</strong>.

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>SPY-PMU: Side-Channel Profiling of Your Performance Monitoring Unit to Leak Remote User Activity</strong><br>
<em>Md Kawser Bepary, Arunabho Basu, Sajeed Mohammad, Rakibul Hassan, Farimah Farahmandi, Mark Tehranipoor</em></p>
<p>The Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU), a standard feature in all modern computing systems, presents significant security risks by leaking sensitive user activities through microarchitectural event data. This work demonstrates the feasibility of remote side-channel attacks leveraging PMU data, revealing vulnerabilities that compromise user privacy and enable covert surveillance without physical access to the target machine. By analyzing the PMU feature space, we create distinct micro-architectural fingerprints for benchmark applications, which are then utilized in machine learning (ML) models to detect the corresponding benchmarks. This approach allows us to build a pre-trained model for benchmark detection using the unique micro-architectural fingerprints derived from PMU data. Subsequently, when an attacker remotely accesses the victim’s PMU data, the pre-trained model enables the identification of applications used by the victim with high accuracy. In our proof-of-concept demonstration, the pre-trained model successfully identifies applications used by a victim when the attacker remotely accesses PMU data, showcasing the potential for malicious exploitation of PMU data. We analyze stress-ng benchmarks and build our classifiers using logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest ML models. Our proposed models achieve an average prediction accuracy of 98%, underscoring the potential risks associated with remote side-channel analysis using PMU data and emphasizing the need for more robust safeguards. This work underscores the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect against such vulnerabilities and provides a foundation for future research in micro-architectural security.</p>

<p>For less than the cost of a latte and in under 10 minutes, scammers today can create shockingly convincing deepfake videos of anyone: your mom, your boss, or even your child.</p>
<p>Imagine receiving a video call from your mom asking to borrow money for an emergency, or getting a voicemail from your boss requesting urgent access to company accounts. These scenarios might seem straightforward, but in 2025, they represent a growing threat: deepfake scams that can be created for just $5 in under 10 minutes. According to McAfee’s latest “State of the Scamiverse” report, deepfake scams have become an everyday reality. The average American now encounters 2.6 deepfake videos daily, with younger adults (18-24) seeing even more – about 3.5 per day. These aren’t just celebrity face-swaps or entertaining memes; they’re sophisticated scams designed to separate people from their money.</p>

		<p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the building blocks of modern applications and digital ecosystems. They enable applications to communicate seamlessly, power integrations, and drive innovation. However, as APIs become the backbone of interconnected systems, they also become high-value targets for cybercriminals. A single vulnerability can open the door to devastating breaches. This is why API security assessments are not just a best practice—they’re a business imperative.</p>

		<p>“This feels pointless.” “My brain is fried.” “Why can’t I think straight?” These aren’t complaints from factory workers pulling double shifts—they’re increasingly common refrains from software engineers, product managers, and tech leads at some of the world’s most sophisticated companies.</p>
<p>At the 2024 Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit, organizational psychologist Dr. Laura Weis and team topology expert Manuel Pais presented stark findings: the human brain’s processing capacity has become the hidden bottleneck in technical organizations. Their research reveals that while companies obsess over system performance metrics, they’re largely blind to cognitive overload that costs $322 billion annually in lost productivity.</p>
