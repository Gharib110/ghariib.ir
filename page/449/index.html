		<p>One of the most critical gaps in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they rely on static knowledge already contained within them. Basically, they might be very good at understanding and responding to prompts, but they often fall short in providing current or highly specific information. This is where Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) comes in;  RAG addresses these critical gaps in traditional LLMs by incorporating current and new information that serves as a reliable source of truth for these models. </p>

		<p>Within software development, security and compliance are more than simple boxes to check. Each attestation and compliance check is backed by a well-considered risk assessment that aims to avoid ever-changing vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Software development teams don’t want to worry about vulnerabilities when they are focused on building something remarkable.</p>
<p>In this article, we explain how Docker Hub and Docker Scout can help development teams ensure a more secure and compliant software supply chain. </p>
