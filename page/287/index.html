<p>In today’s fast-paced world of software development and IT operations, organizations need to continuously improve their ability to deploy applications quickly, reliably, and at scale. This is where DevOps practices come into play, blending development and operations for more efficient workflows. One of the cornerstones of a successful DevOps implementation is <strong>monitoring and observability</strong>, as it ensures real-time visibility into application performance, system health, and infrastructure. Datadog, a leading platform in this field, is at the forefront of providing these capabilities, helping DevOps teams ensure better service delivery, faster problem resolution, and enhanced operational insights.</p>

<p>DevOps is a set of practices that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the system development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. Implementing DevOps effectively within an organization can lead to faster delivery, more reliable products, and more efficient collaboration between teams. This article will provide a detailed guide on how DevOps can be implemented within an organization and how different approaches, such as incorporating <strong>DevOps best practices</strong> alongside modern <strong>tools</strong> and methodologies, work together for success.</p>

	<div>
		<p>At the time of writing, there are hundreds of thousands of publicly known vulnerabilities. These range from critical flaws that could cause irreparable damage if exploited to low-severity issues that might seem barely even worth bothering with. With vulnerability management, the challenge is knowing which is which.  With so many vulnerabilities across operating systems, networks, software, […]</p>

		<p>How cyberhooligans are hacking vulnerable Ecovacs robot vacuums and lawnmowers to spy on their owners and rain misery upon them.</p>
<p>Imagine: you get up in the night for a glass of water, walk across the unlit landing, when out of the darkness a voice starts yelling at you. Not nice, you’d surely agree. But that’s the new reality for owners of vulnerable robot vacuums, which can be commanded by hackers to turn from domestic servants into foul-mouthed louts. And that’s not all: hackers can also control the robot remotely and access its live camera feed.</p>

	<b><time>10.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Our latest Canonical website rebrand did not just bring the new Vanilla-based frontend, it also saw the introduction of Python Flask as the preferred web framework. Flask provides a good foundation for building new applications using the 12-factor methodology, effectively increasing our web team’s speed and efficiency in adding new features.</p>
<p>Because our web team works on both the website and the product’s UI we decided to take operational improvements one step further by providing a way to stand up in a few simple commands a fully integrated and observable Kubernetes environment for their Flask apps. Our solution, called 12-factor charms, provides an easy to use abstraction layer over existing Canonical products and it is aimed at application developers who create applications based on the 12-factor methodology.</p>

	<b><time>10.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Event-Driven Ansible is a powerful extension to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform that leverages the automation infrastructure to provide the ability to react to change or problems. In short, Event-Driven Ansible can trigger Ansible playbooks (or Ansible Automation Platform&rsquo;s Job Templates) if a certain event is detected.</p>
<p>In this article, we will provide a series of examples on how to use Event-Driven Ansible to implement several remediation strategies based on activities in the environment. We&rsquo;ll use Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP), part of Red Hat Runtimes, as a reference implementation.</p>

<p>At the recent 38C3 conference in Germany, someone gave a talk about sending TOSLINK digital audio over fiber optic networks rather than the very low-end short distance fibre you’ll find behind hour CD player. This gave [Manawyrm] some ideas, so of course the IP-over TOSLINK network was born.</p>
<p>TOSLINK is in effect I2S digital audio as light, so it carries two 44.1 kilosamples per second 16-bit data streams over a synchronous serial connection. At 1544 Kbps, this is coincidentally about the same as a T1 leased line. The synchronous serial link of a TOSLINK connection is close enough to the High-Level Data Link Control, or HDLC, protocol used in some networking applications, and as luck would have it she had some experience in using PPP over HDLC. She could configure her software from that to use a pair of cheap USB sound cards with TOSLINK ports, and achieve a surprisingly respectable 1.47 Mbit/s.</p>
