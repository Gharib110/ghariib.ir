<p>Cellebrite makes software to automate physically extracting and indexing data from mobile devices. They exist within the grey – where enterprise branding joins together with the larcenous to be called “digital intelligence.” Their customer list has included authoritarian regimes in Belarus, Russia, Venezuela, and China; death squads in Bangladesh; military juntas in Myanmar; and those seeking to abuse and oppress in Turkey, UAE, and elsewhere. A few months ago, they <a href="https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-and-clickbait/">announced that they added Signal support to their software</a>.</p>

<p>As the world stands today, the future of transaction privacy does not look great. The existing landscape is dominated by traditional credit companies, who over the past decade have been steadily pushing their networks for increased access to user data. They (and their data customers) are on a track to getting SKU level data of every purchase everyone makes everywhere. There are other contenders, such as regional online payments networks (like Venmo in the US), but the data story there is similar.</p>

<p>The latest Signal betas are rolling out today. Inside, you’ll find performance enhancements, a slew of bug fixes, improvements to the mute settings, and if you’re in the United Kingdom, you’ll see support for Signal Payments – a new feature that enables you to send and receive privacy focused payments as easily as sending or receiving a message. This is a beta feature in a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-">beta build</a>, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback.</p>
