	<div>
		<p>As internet security evolves, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates, cornerstones of encrypted communication, are stepping into a brand-new role as vital tools in the fight against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Experts are now leveraging <strong>SSL intelligence</strong> and historical SSL data to expose hidden threat actor infrastructure, track malware activity, and thwart potential cyber threats before they gain traction.</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Austrian economist Gene Callahan likes to remind us that fantasy is not an adult policy option.</p>
<p>We are often reminded of his words in national debates and handwringing over potential budget cuts, whether by the Republican-led Congress, or President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—or attempts to address the $36 trillion debt elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Economist Bryan Caplan has pointed out a number of systematically biased beliefs American voters hold about the economy. Generally, Americans tend to hold four basic biases about the economy: an anti-market bias, leading to favor government intervention; an anti-foreign bias, which leads them to underestimate the contributions of foreigners and the benefits of trade; a make-work bias, which equates prosperity with the number of jobs (regardless of productivity or value added); and a pessimism bias, which leads them to think that economic conditions are far worse than they really are.</p>

<p>Have you ever gotten into a debate with an OpenAI bot? If so, did you find it particularly convincing or appealing to human nature? If you did, there&rsquo;s a good reason behind it. OpenAI has revealed that, to train some of the most powerful AI models in the world, it simply points it toward a subreddit built solely for argument and debate and lets the training algorithm do the rest.</p>
