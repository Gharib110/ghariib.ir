<p>It was Dan and Elliot behind the microphones today for a transatlantic look at the week in hacks. There was a bucket of news about AI, kicked off by Deepseek suddenly coming into the zeitgeist and scaring the pants off investors for… reasons? No matter, we’re more interested in the tech anyway, such as a deep dive into deep space communications from a backyard antenna farm that’s carefully calibrated to give the HOA fits. We got down and dirty with capacitors, twice even, and looked at a clever way to stuff two websites into one QR code. It’s all Taylor, all the time on every channel of the FM band, which we don’t recommend you do (for multiple reasons) but it’s nice to know you can. Plus, great kinetic art project, but that tooling deserves a chef’s kiss. Finally, we wrap up with our Can’t Miss articles where Jenny roots for the right to repair, and Al gives us the <code>finger(1)</code>.</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a sophisticated campaign leveraging GitHub’s trusted release infrastructure to distribute the Lumma Stealer malware.</p>
<p>This information-stealing malware, part of a growing trend of cybercriminals abusing legitimate platforms, poses significant risks by exfiltrating sensitive data and deploying additional malicious payloads.</p>
<p>The attackers utilized GitHub repositories to host malicious files disguised as legitimate software.</p>
<p>In one example, users were tricked into downloading files such as <code>Pictore.exe</code> and <code>App_aelGCY3g.exe</code> from GitHub-hosted URLs.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 30, 2025</p>
<p>Modern defensive cyber solutions, while impressive, have failed in the face of cheap and easy-to-create – and most importantly lucrative – ransomware, according to Austin, Texas-based Halcyon, an anti-ransomware company.</p>
<p>Halcyon claims to have built the first anti-ransomware engine to tackle this problem. Their team has spent decades building name-brand security products and delivering security consulting to much of the Fortune 500.</p>

Linux users hunting for a native client to stream music from TIDAL will want to keep an eye on a promising new open-source app called High Tide. High Tide is an unofficial but native Linux client for the TIDAL music streaming service. It’s written in Python, uses GTK4/libadwaita UI, and leverages official TIDAL APIs for playback. TIDAL, often positioned as the ‘pro-artist music streaming platform’, isn’t as popular as industry titan Spotify (likely because it doesn’t offer a ‘free’ ad-supported tier) but is nonetheless a solid rival to it in terms of features and catalogue breadth. Windows, macOS, Android and […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Small businesses may think they don’t need to implement cybersecurity training programs because larger enterprises with more revenue are more profitable for bad actors. However, small businesses lacking essential security measures are prime targets due to the ease of access and fewer resources for investigation and remediation. While cybersecurity solutions can be an indispensable part of a robust cybersecurity strategy, it is crucial for even small organizations to prioritize user security awareness training (SAT) alongside these tools. According to a recent Cyber Risk Report published by IT&hellip;</p>

<p>Identity theft is a growing concern, and Data Privacy Week serves as an important reminder to safeguard your personal information. In today’s digital age, scammers have more tools than ever to steal your identity, often with just a few key details—like your Social Security number, bank account information, or home address.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, identity theft claims have surged in recent years, jumping from approximately 650,000 in 2019 to over a million in 2023, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This trend underscores the urgent need for stronger personal data protection habits.</p>

<p>Many macOS users believe their operating system is immune to malware, so they don’t need to take extra security precautions. In reality, it’s far from the truth, and new threats keep popping up.</p>

<p>Yes — and plenty of ’em. Here are some examples of Mac malware we’ve previously covered on Kaspersky Daily and Securelist:</p>

<p>This is a step by step beginner’s guide shows how to configure Nginx to block certain IPs or IP range from accessing your website, and block all others while only you (and specified IPs) can access the wordpress login pages.</p>
<p>This site was under attack a few days ago. Someone made tens of thousands of constant requests that slowed down the server response. And, here’s what I did to manually block attacker’s IPs and restrict access to the login page.</p>
