		<p>Day One is now available on Windows and anyone can try it for free.</p>
<p>Journal apps on digital platforms are fairly popular, especially among people who want to keep a digitized record of their lives. A couple of years ago, Apple announced its built-in <strong>Journal</strong> app for iOS, entering a competitive market which already features the likes of Everlog, Obsidian, and Day One. If you&rsquo;re a customer of the last app mentioned in this list, you&rsquo;ll be happy to hear that the digital journal has now made its way to Windows.</p>

		<p>This is a cryptography blog and I always feel the need to apologize for any post that isn‚Äôt ‚Äústraight cryptography.‚Äù I‚Äôm actually getting a little tired of apologizing for it (though if you want some hard-core cryptography content, there‚Äôs plenty here and here.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to remind my colleagues that out in the real world, our job is not to solve exciting mathematical problems: <em>it‚Äôs to help people communicate securely</em>. And people, at this very moment, need a lot of help. Many of my friends are Federal employees or work for contractors, and they‚Äôre terrified that they‚Äôre going to lose their job based on speech they post online. Unfortunately, ‚Äúonline‚Äù to many people includes thoughts sent over private text messages ‚Äî so even private conversations are becoming chilled. And while this is hardly the worst thing happening to people in this world, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs happening to my friends and neighbors.</p>

</p>
<p>The promise of cloud native applications lies in their ability to provide enhanced agility, scalability, and resilience, perfectly aligning with the digital transformation needs of today&rsquo;s enterprises. However, as we navigate this transformation, cloud native application security is often surrounded by myths and misconceptions. Understanding these myths and how they are being addressed is crucial for organizations to secure their environments effectively.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The generative AI (GenAI) landscape is evolving at breakneck speed, and with it, the challenges for enterprise security. DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 model, released on January 20, 2025, gained rapid popularity due to its high performance and cost-efficiency. It rivaled established AI models at a fraction of the cost. The open-source nature of DeepSeek also allowed AI developers to use it for free, contributing to its swift rise in app stores and industry rankings.</p>

<p>Less walled gardens, more sunlight.</p>
<p>You can read the theme story and get some visual inspiration on the DEF CON 33 Theme and Style Guide page. You can get it in a PDF on media.defcon.org. Homework assignments to get you into the vibe coming soon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cyber Threats in Manufacturing:</strong>¬†The 2025 Trustwave Risk Radar Report highlights how cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in manufacturing infrastructure, workers, and digital supply chains, with over 3,500 critical vulnerabilities listed on CISA&rsquo;s KEV list.</li>
<li><strong>Top Manufacturing Cyber Risks:</strong>¬†Attackers leverage high-profile exploits like¬†<strong>CVE-2014-0160</strong> <strong>(Heartbleed),</strong>¬†CVE-2021-40438 (Apache SSRF), and CVE-2024-4577 (PHP RCE) to disrupt production and steal sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Cyber Defense Strategies:</strong>¬†Manufacturers must implement regular vulnerability management, network security enhancements (firewalls, IDS/IPS), and strict access controls (MFA, RBAC) to mitigate risks and protect operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted in the just-released Trustwave SpiderLabs report,¬†2025 Trustwave Risk Radar Report: Manufacturing Sector, modern manufacturing systems are increasingly interconnected, creating fertile ground for cybercriminals.</p>
