<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 17, 2025</p>
<p>Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated, with more advanced technologies than ever at the disposal of cybercriminals.</p>
<p>In 2025, cybercrime damages are expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. These costs stem from numerous factors, including money stolen directly, ransomware payouts, lost business opportunities and impacted productivity, fraud, recovery efforts, regulatory fines, and much more.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Decompose and conquer: ZVP attacks on GLV curves</strong><br>
<em>Vojtěch Suchánek, Vladimír Sedláček, Marek Sýs</em></p>
<p>While many side-channel attacks on elliptic curve cryptography can be avoided by coordinate randomization, this is not the case for the zero-value point (ZVP) attack. This attack can recover a prefix of static ECDH key but requires solving an instance of the dependent coordinates problem (DCP), which is open in general. We design a new method for solving the DCP on GLV curves, including the Bitcoin secp256k1 curve, outperforming previous approaches. This leads to a new type of ZVP attack on multiscalar multiplication, recovering twice as many bits when compared to the classical ZVP attack. We demonstrate a $63%$ recovery of the private key for the interleaving algorithm for multiscalar multiplication. Finally, we analyze the largest database of curves and addition formulas with over 14 000 combinations and provide the first classification of their resistance against the ZVP attack.</p>

	<div>
		<p>I recently completed building a Simple Calculator to help members calculate their distributions payable from OnePath. Every quarter or so, Onepath<br>
publishes a spreadsheet containing all the distributions payable for the managed funds which they sell. Customers have to go through the sheets, find their fund and copy the distribution cents per share, then do the calculation against the number of units they own.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>I think this process is quite tedious and outdated. It would be ideal if Onepath has an app, but building apps is not their primary business.</p>

		<p>Most of the web already supports HTTPS: In fact, 93% of requests made by Firefox are already HTTPS. As a reminder, HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) fixes the security shortcoming of HTTP by creating a secure and encrypted connection. Oftentimes, when web applications enable encryption with HTTPS on their servers, legacy content may still contain references using HTTP, even though that content would also be available over a secure and encrypted connection. When such a document gets loaded over HTTPS but subresources like images, audio and video are loaded using HTTP, it is referred to as “mixed content”.</p>
