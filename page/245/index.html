		<p>SentinelLabs has identified multiple deceptive websites linked to businesses in China fronting for North Korea&rsquo;s fake IT workers scheme.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>SentinelLabs has identified unique characteristics of multiple websites, now seized by the US Government, associated with the DPRK IT Worker front companies.</li>
<li>We assess with high confidence that DPRK actors seek to impersonate US based software and technology consulting businesses by copying the online brands of legitimate organizations, seeking to use these for financial objectives.</li>
<li>SentinelLabs has linked the activity to several active front companies and links these with high confidence to a larger set of organizations being created in China.</li>
<li>Our findings link additional companies, which remain active today, to the DPRK IT Workers scheme.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>North Korea operates a global network of IT workers, both as individuals and under front companies, to evade sanctions and generate revenue for the regime. These workers are highly skilled in areas like software development, mobile applications, blockchain, and cryptocurrency technologies. By posing as professionals from other countries using fake identities and forged credentials, they secure remote jobs and freelance contracts with businesses worldwide.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of the re-emergence of a more advanced NonEuclid RAT variant in the cyber threat arena, a novel malware iteration known as the Eagerbee backdoor poses an increasing threat to organizations in the Middle East, primarily targeting Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and state agencies. The enhanced EAGERBEE backdoor variant can deploy payloads, scan file systems, and execute command shells, displaying significant evolution of its offensive capabilities.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Efficient Authentication Protocols from the Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem</strong><br>
<em>Thomas Johansson, Mustafa Khairallah, Vu Nguyen</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce an oracle version of the Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem (RSDP) and propose novel authentication protocols based on the hardness of this problem. They follow the basic structure of the HB-family of authentication protocols and later improvements but demonstrate several advantages. An appropriate choice of multiplicative subgroup and ring structure gives rise to a very efficient hardware implementation compared to other emph{Learning Parity with Noise} based approaches. In addition, the new protocols also have lower key size, lower communication costs, and potentially better completeness/soundness compared to learning-based alternatives. This is appealing in the context of low-cost, low-powered authenticating devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. Lastly, we show that with additional assumptions, RSDP can be used to instantiate a Man-in-the-Middle secured authentication protocol.</p>

I first made this project using Raspberry Pi Zero and Python (link), and then I re-made it using ESP32 and Arduino. My weather dashboard shows the current weather and a bar chart of 5-day high and low temperatures. There&rsquo;s also a menu interface for switching Wi-Fi connections.</p>
<p>Hardware setup: ESP32 paired with a Nextion NX8048T050 HMI touchscreen display on UART2.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather data fetching from Open-Meteo API</li>
<li>Utilizes WiFi library for network connection management</li>
<li>Utilizes Nextion GUI designing commands to draw a 5-day weather bar chart</li>
<li>Automatic location detection via IPInfo.io API</li>
<li>Geocoder for location name resolution via Nominatim API</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to set up all the binaries/elf and RTOS from scratch without using the Arduino framework. I don&rsquo;t know how hard would it be. I hope I&rsquo;ll make it in a few weeks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Extending Groth16 for Disjunctive Statements</strong><br>
<em>Xudong Zhu, Xinxuan Zhang, Xuyang Song, Yi Deng, Yuanju Wei, Liuyu Yang</em></p>
<p>Two most common ways to design non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs are based on Sigma ($Sigma$)-protocols (an efficient way to prove algebraic statements) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocols (an efficient way to prove arithmetic statements). However, in the applications of cryptocurrencies such as privacy-preserving credentials, privacy-preserving audits, and blockchain-based voting systems, the zk-SNARKs for general statements are usually implemented with encryption, commitment, or other algebraic cryptographic schemes. Moreover, zk-SNARKs for many different arithmetic statements may also be required to be implemented together. Clearly, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the code for algebraic part. However, complex cryptographic operations in the algebraic algorithms will significantly increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size. Thus, we need a flexible enough proof system for composite statements including both algebraic and arithmetic statements. Unfortunately, while the conjunction of zk-SNARKs is relatively natural and numerous effective solutions are currently available (e.g. by utilizing the commit-and-prove technique), the disjunction of zk-SNARKs is rarely discussed in detail. In this paper, we mainly focus on the disjunctive statements of Groth16, and we propose a Groth16 variant&mdash;CompGroth16, which provides a framework for Groth16 to prove the disjunctive statements that consist of a mix of algebraic and arithmetic components. Specifically, we could directly combine CompGroth16 with $Sigma$-protocol or even CompGroth16 with CompGroth16 just like the logical composition of $Sigma$-protocols. From this, we can gain many good properties, such as broader expression, better prover&rsquo;s efficiency and shorter CRS. In addition, for the combination of CompGroth16 and $Sigma$-protocol, we also present two representative application scenarios to demonstrate the practicality of our construction.</p>
