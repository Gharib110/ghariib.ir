		<p>Job Posting: <strong>Assistant/Associate Professor</strong><br>
<em>University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK</em></p>
<p>The School of Computer Science is further investing in its already strong Security and Privacy Research group.</p>
<p>We seek to recruit an outstanding researcher with a specific interest in applied cryptography in the context of hardware and embedded systems security. We are particularly interested in researchers with a track record in pre-silicon leakage and/or fault analysis, secure embedded software development, statistical side channel and fault evaluation techniques, machine and deep learning for side channels.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the perfect capacitor to decouple the power rails around ICs is a 100 nF ceramic capacitor or equivalent, yet where does this ‘fact’ come from and is it even correct? These are the questions that [Graham] set out to answer once and for all. He starts with an in-depth exploration of the decoupling capacitor (and related) theory. [Graham] then dives into the way that power delivery is affected by the inherent resistance, capacitance, and inductance of traces. This is the problem that decoupling capacitors are supposed to solve.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 22 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-46881<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 26, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 22 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control. Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version 8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7; or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker.<br>
