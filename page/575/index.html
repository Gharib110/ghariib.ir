<p>I know very well that each and every crisis of modernity is concentrating, concatenating, and seating more deeply into everyday life. I know the struggles of the world’s unseen and unheard are being subsumed – appropriated – under and into the framework of a liberal democracy, leaving those at the periphery still under the yoke of capital. The Right further entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the <a href="http://www.alecexposed.org/">United States</a>, and (more extremely) abroad (<a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/book_racism_becoming_more_acceptable_in_finland/6360055">Finland</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/greek-politics">Greece</a>, … et al.). The Left is no less problematic: reiterating the petty values of social democracy, negotiating the terms of our entrapment within capitalism. Every season, new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also work in reverse. The world’s genetic library – the most prime commons, if ever one existed – is rapidly contracting via extinction, privatization, and engineering. The colossal failure of ideology in the twentieth century has left the radicals of today no other choice but to see themselves as “post-ideological”. This is a deeply concerning conundrum, as ideology survives in post-ideology, different only to the extent that it is less apparent. Yes, it seems like we are living in end times – an entire era of Apocalypse – made only more insidious by our optimism in its shadow.</p>

<p><em>Spring Break Of Code, Day Four</em></p>
<p>The main sound on top of the ocean is the click clack of laptop keys, and the jangle of test calls and SMSes. A neighbor stopped by to comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working instead of surfing made sense in his mind only in the land of money at the end of the tunnel. He loaned us his stand up paddle boards, surely expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited into the sunset. A journalist visiting Open Whisper Systems’ Spring Break of Code commented that she expected more philosophy, politics, and conversation. After all this group is composed of people who are not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists, and humanists. <a href="/blog/streamlining-textsecure-settings/">Lilia</a> went over some of the <em>why</em>, but practically anyone could see we were concentrating on the <em>how</em>, and in the frenzied silence it was clear that a common philosophy was assumed and what bound us here was the challenges in the technology to power that philosophy.</p>

<p><em>Spring Break Of Code, Day Three</em></p>
<p>I am no stranger to Hawaii. Although I’ve never lived here myself, I’ve visited the islands perhaps a dozen times. My grandmother and my father were born and raised here. My mother attended college here. I have aunts, uncles, and cousins who’ve lived on various islands, moved away, came back, moved away and back again. I even have Native Hawaiian blood in my veins.</p>

<p><em>Spring Break Of Code, Day Two</em></p>
<p>“I am torn on how best to introduce myself out of context like this, the idea of rattling off facts from my resume is my first instinct, but that seems terribly conventional. With the goal of introducing myself and the entirety of my character, my second (highly unconventional) instinct is to link you to my online dating profile with the prayer that such an action would be taken in the desired context. Through my indecision I hope to explain who I am and why I would like to travel across the country to be involved with the Institute for Disruptive Studies. So here goes…”</p>

<p><em>Spring Break Of Code, Day One.</em></p>
<p>One of the first times I met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie</a> while travelling, we met at a dive bar in San Francisco’s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.</p>
