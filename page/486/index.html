	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In late November 2024, Anthropic announced a new way to interact with AI, called Model Context Protocol (MCP). Today, we’re excited to show you how to use MCP in combination with Cloudflare to extend the capabilities of Claude to build applications, generate images and more. You’ll learn how to build an MCP server on Cloudflare to make any service accessible through an AI assistant like Claude with just a few lines of code using Cloudflare Workers. </p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In today’s complex cybersecurity landscape, organizations face a critical challenge when security incidents occur: determining when and how to report to regulators and other oversight bodies. This decision can have significant implications for compliance, reputation, and legal liability. A virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) can provide invaluable assistance in navigating these waters. Here’s how:</p>
<h2 id="1-regulatory-expertise"> 1. Regulatory Expertise</h2>
<p>A vCISO brings deep knowledge of various regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and industry-specific regulations. They stay current on reporting requirements and can quickly assess which regulations apply to your specific incident.</p>

		<p><em>This ongoing</em> <em>Docker Labs GenAI series</em> <em>explores the exciting space of AI developer tools. At Docker, we believe there is a vast scope to explore, openly and without the hype. We will share our explorations and collaborate with the developer community in real time. Although developers have adopted autocomplete tooling like GitHub Copilot and use chat, there is significant potential for AI tools to assist with more specific tasks and interfaces throughout the entire software lifecycle. Therefore, our exploration will be broad. We will be releasing software as open source so you can play, explore, and hack with us, too.</em></p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Vendor risk management (VRM) is critical for organizations relying on third-party vendors. As businesses increasingly depend on external partners, ensuring these vendors maintain high security standards is vital. ChatGPT can enhance and streamline various aspects of VRM. Here’s how and why you should integrate ChatGPT into your vendor risk management process:</p>
<h2 id="1-automating-vendor-communications">1. Automating Vendor Communications</h2>
<p>ChatGPT can serve as a virtual assistant, automating repetitive communication tasks such as gathering information or following up on security policies.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-platform-as-a-product-drives-cloud-native-platform-maturity-giant-swarm/">How Platform-as-a-Product drives cloud native platform maturity  » Giant Swarm</a></h1>
	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In the dynamic landscape of cloud native technologies, a standout trend emerges: platform engineering is the new cool kid in class! In the last few months alone, it’s hard to find a CNCF event without a spotlight on platform engineering. Notably, the 2024 KubeCon EU takes it a step further, dedicating a co-located event exclusively to this rising star.</p>
<p>Why the buzz? Simply put, it’s the evolution of the DevOps mindset, now taking center stage to empower countless developer teams. At its core, platform engineering revolves around making developers’ lives significantly easier by bootstrapping development capabilities into a developer platform. Imagine a world where requesting cloud native products doesn’t lead to drowning in a sea of tickets, relying on that one infrastructure guy you know or deciphering the nuances among myriad similar-sounding AWS offerings. No, DevOps is not dead; rather, platform engineering is the formalization of the DevOps mindset, especially driven within large enterprises. Developer platforms reduce the cognitive overload of developer teams while still empowering them with self-service infrastructure.</p>
