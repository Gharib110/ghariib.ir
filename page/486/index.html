		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Extending Groth16 for Disjunctive Statements</strong><br>
<em>Xudong Zhu, Xinxuan Zhang, Xuyang Song, Yi Deng, Yuanju Wei, Liuyu Yang</em></p>
<p>Two most common ways to design non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs are based on Sigma ($Sigma$)-protocols (an efficient way to prove algebraic statements) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocols (an efficient way to prove arithmetic statements). However, in the applications of cryptocurrencies such as privacy-preserving credentials, privacy-preserving audits, and blockchain-based voting systems, the zk-SNARKs for general statements are usually implemented with encryption, commitment, or other algebraic cryptographic schemes. Moreover, zk-SNARKs for many different arithmetic statements may also be required to be implemented together. Clearly, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the code for algebraic part. However, complex cryptographic operations in the algebraic algorithms will significantly increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size. Thus, we need a flexible enough proof system for composite statements including both algebraic and arithmetic statements. Unfortunately, while the conjunction of zk-SNARKs is relatively natural and numerous effective solutions are currently available (e.g. by utilizing the commit-and-prove technique), the disjunction of zk-SNARKs is rarely discussed in detail. In this paper, we mainly focus on the disjunctive statements of Groth16, and we propose a Groth16 variant&mdash;CompGroth16, which provides a framework for Groth16 to prove the disjunctive statements that consist of a mix of algebraic and arithmetic components. Specifically, we could directly combine CompGroth16 with $Sigma$-protocol or even CompGroth16 with CompGroth16 just like the logical composition of $Sigma$-protocols. From this, we can gain many good properties, such as broader expression, better prover&rsquo;s efficiency and shorter CRS. In addition, for the combination of CompGroth16 and $Sigma$-protocol, we also present two representative application scenarios to demonstrate the practicality of our construction.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Foundations of Platform-Assisted Auctions</strong><br>
<em>Hao Chung, Ke Wu, Elaine Shi</em></p>
<p>Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. These platforms serve as a rendezvous point for the buyers and sellers, and charge a fee for its service. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions. Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully, assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits.</p>

<p>A 9×9 grid of LEGO shafts all turning in unison is just one of the non-trivial design challenges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In principle the treadmill works by placing an object on a bed of identical, rotating discs. By tilting the discs, one controls which edge is in contact with the object, which in turn controls the direction the object moves. While the concept is straightforward, the implementation is a wee bit more complex. LEGO pieces offer a rich variety of mechanical functions, but even so, making a 9×9 array of discs all rotate in unison turns out to be a nontrivial problem to solve. Gears alone are not the answer, because the shafts in such a dense array are a bit too close for LEGO gears to play nicely.</p>

	<b><time>08.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s recent announcement of their Willow quantum processor marks a significant advancement in quantum computing technology while raising questions about the security and sustainability of current encryption methods. As quantum computers grow more powerful, cybersecurity experts grow increasingly concerned about their potential to break widely used encryption standards that protect sensitive data worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-vs-traditional-computing"><strong>Quantum vs. Traditional Computing:</strong></h2>
<p>Google’s Willow quantum processor is a leap forward in quantum computing capabilities, particularly in its approach to error correction and qubit stability. Unlike traditional computers that process information in bits (either 0s or 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states at the same time. Because of this, quantum computers can test millions of combinations simultaneously instead of one at a time. This fundamental difference allows quantum computers to solve certain types of problems exponentially faster than classical computers, including the mathematical problems that form the foundation of today&rsquo;s encryption standards. When tested, Willow performed a standard computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years - a number that exceeds the age of the universe (Google).</p>
