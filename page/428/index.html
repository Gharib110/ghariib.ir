		<p>If you’re a Linux user, and you use distros such as Ubuntu or Debian, then you will have surely seen the command apt update. But what is it, exactly, and why do you want to run it often? In this article, we are going to break down the apt update command into simple words and explain what role it has in keeping your system running as it should.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-apt">What is apt?</h2>
<p><strong>APT</strong> is an acronym for <strong>Advanced Package Tool</strong>, and it is a command-line utility that allows us to handle software packages in Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu. An example of a package manager that you can use is called <code>apt</code> and is used to install, upgrade, and remove packages on your system.</p>

		<p>What is patching automation?</p>
<p>With increasing numbers of vulnerabilities, there is a growing risk of cyber incidents, attacks and breaches. It’s more important than ever to ensure that your systems are protected 24/7. </p>
<p>Patching is a vital step in any vulnerability management process. In this blog, we’ll outline what patch management is, compare manual and automatic patch management, outline the use cases and benefits of automated patch management, and define clear steps for outlining your automated patch management strategy.</p>

<p>In a 2020 paper, Patrick Lewis and his research team introduced the term RAG, or retrieval-augmented generation. This technique enhances generative AI models by utilizing external knowledge sources such as documents and extensive databases. RAG addresses a gap in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). While traditional models rely on static knowledge already contained within them, RAG incorporates current information that serves as a reliable source of truth for LLMs. Although LLMs can rapidly understand and respond to prompts, without RAG, they often fall short in providing current or more specific information.</p>

		<p>In the wake of EU drafted legislation and US executive orders, a software bill of materials (SBOM) has gone from a nice-to-have to a fundamental piece of software documentation. In this article, we’ll examine what an SBOM is, what information it must include, and the approaches that developers and manufacturers alike should consider as they start building their SBOM.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Today, computers are more sophisticated, interconnected and complex than ever. This means they’re more capable than ever – but it also comes with a downside: that their attack surface is larger than ever, leading to an elevated risk of cyber incidents. Therefore, your approach to managing vulnerabilities needs to be holistic and prepare for all the ways in which vulnerabilities could cause damage to users, systems or your organization’s operations and reputation. In short, you need a vulnerability management plan. </p>
