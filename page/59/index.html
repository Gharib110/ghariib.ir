		<p>Austrian economist Gene Callahan likes to remind us that fantasy is not an adult policy option.</p>
<p>We are often reminded of his words in national debates and handwringing over potential budget cuts, whether by the Republican-led Congress, or President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—or attempts to address the $36 trillion debt elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Economist Bryan Caplan has pointed out a number of systematically biased beliefs American voters hold about the economy. Generally, Americans tend to hold four basic biases about the economy: an anti-market bias, leading to favor government intervention; an anti-foreign bias, which leads them to underestimate the contributions of foreigners and the benefits of trade; a make-work bias, which equates prosperity with the number of jobs (regardless of productivity or value added); and a pessimism bias, which leads them to think that economic conditions are far worse than they really are.</p>

<p>Have you ever gotten into a debate with an OpenAI bot? If so, did you find it particularly convincing or appealing to human nature? If you did, there&rsquo;s a good reason behind it. OpenAI has revealed that, to train some of the most powerful AI models in the world, it simply points it toward a subreddit built solely for argument and debate and lets the training algorithm do the rest.</p>
