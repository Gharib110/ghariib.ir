		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the Anonymity of Linkable Ring Signatures</strong><br>
<em>Xavier Bultel, Charles Olivier-Anclin</em></p>
<p>Security models provide a way of formalising security properties in a rigorous way, but it is sometimes difficult to ensure that the model really fits the concept that we are trying to formalise. In this paper, we illustrate this fact by showing the discrepancies between the security model of anonymity of linkable ring signatures and the security that is actually expected for this kind of signature. These signatures allow a user to sign anonymously within an ad hoc group generated from the public keys of the group members, but all their signatures can be linked together. Reading the related literature, it seems obvious that users&rsquo; identities must remain hidden even when their signatures are linked, but we show that, surprisingly, almost none have adopted a security model that guarantees it. We illustrate this by presenting two counter-examples which are secure in most anonymity model of linkable ring signatures, but which trivially leak a signer&rsquo;s identity after only two signatures.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade but don&rsquo;t want to spend over $1,000 on a graphics card, going with something from the Radeon series might be the best solution. Not only will you get fantastic performance, but if you can find a card at a good price, you&rsquo;ll get better bang for your buck. With that said, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with one of our favorite graphics cards, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX.</p>

<p>The post Open source AI is already finding its way into production appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Open source has long driven innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, from web interfaces to cloud-native computing. The same is true in the burgeoning field of open source artificial intelligence (AI). Open source AI models, and the tooling to build and use them, are multiplying, enabling developers around the world to build custom AI solutions and host them where they choose.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of a satellite called Parcae (pronounced like park-eye)? If you haven’t, don’t feel bad—it was, after all, a top-secret project only revealed in July 2023. [Ivan Amato] not only heard about it, but also wrote a fascinating peek into the cloak-and-dagger world of cold-war spy satellites for this month’s IEEE Spectrum.</p>
<p>According to [Ivan], the satellite helped the United States to keep track of Russian submarines and was arguably the most capable orbiting spy platform ever. Or, at least, that we get to hear about.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Path Privacy and Handovers: Preventing Insider Traceability Attacks During Secure Handovers</strong><br>
<em>Rabiah Alnashwan, Benjamin Dowling, Bhagya Wimalasiri</em></p>
<p>The rise of 5G and IoT has shifted secure communication from centralized and homogeneous to a landscape of heterogeneous mobile devices constantly travelling between myriad networks. In such environments, it is desirable for devices to securely extend their connection from one network to another, often referred to as a handover. In this work we introduce the first cryptographic formalisation of secure handover schemes. We leverage our formalisation to propose path privacy, a novel security property for handovers that has hitherto remained unexplored. We further develop a syntax for secure handovers, and identify security properties appropriate for secure handover schemes. Finally, we introduce a generic handover scheme that captures all the strong notions of security we have identified, combining our novel path privacy concept with other security properties characteristic to existing handover schemes, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our framework.</p>
