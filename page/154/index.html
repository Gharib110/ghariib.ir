		<p>Who claimed quantum supremacy and decryption on quantum computers?</p>
<p>Quantum computers remain a highly exotic technology, used by a very small number of companies for very specific computational tasks. But if you search for ‚Äúquantum computer news‚Äù, you might get the impression that all the major IT players have already armed themselves with quantum technology, and that any day now hackers will start using it to crack encrypted communications and manipulate digital signatures. The reality is both less tense and more complex ‚Äî but such nuances don‚Äôt make the headlines. So, who‚Äôs been making all the noise about quantum hacking?‚Ä¶</p>

		<p>With the right hardware and OS, even a Raspberry Pi can serve as solid daily driver</p>
<p>Over the years, SBCs have seen significant improvements in both processing capabilities and software compatibility. Modern-day Single-Board Computers have become versatile enough to power a wide variety of projects. This trend also extends to the Raspberry Pi series, with the RPi 5 packing enough firepower to run full-fledged desktop operating systems.</p>

<p>The RP2040 has quickly become a hot favorite with tinkerers and makers since its release in early 2021. This is largely attributed to the low cost, fast GPIOs, and plethora of bus peripherals. [xyphro] has written the I3C Blaster firmware that helps turn the Raspberry Pi Pico into a USB to I3C converter.</p>
<p>The firmware is essentially a bit-bang wrapper and exposes an interactive shell with a generous command set. But it is a lot more than that. [xyphro] has taken the time to dive into the I3C implementation standard and the code is a fairly complex state-machine that is a story on its own.</p>

		<p>In keeping with our commitment to the security and privacy of individuals on the internet, Mozilla is increasing our oversight and adding automation to our compliance-checking of publicly trusted intermediate CA certificates (‚Äúintermediate certificates‚Äù). This improvement in automation is important because intermediate certificates play a critical part in the web PKI (Public-Key Infrastructure). Intermediate CA keys directly sign server certificates, and we currently recognize nearly 3,000 intermediate certificates, which chain up to approximately 150 root CA certificates embedded as trust anchors in NSS and Firefox. More specifically, we are updating the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) and associated guidance, improving the public review of third-party intermediate certificates on the Mozilla dev-security-policy list, and enhancing automation in the Common CA Database (CCADB).</p>

		<p>Hello everyone! I‚Äôm new here and looking for some feedback on a thought I‚Äôve had recently. I‚Äôve been exploring the cryptocurrency market and came across an interesting trend: memecoins. A while ago, a Brazilian adult content creator launched a memecoin called &lsquo;bct&rsquo; (short for &lsquo;pussy&rsquo; in Portuguese), and she made a significant profit from it. This got me thinking: what if other adult content creators started their own memecoins? With the rise of online content creation as a career, these creators have massive influence, and it seems like an untapped niche in the crypto world. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this‚Äîcould this be a viable new market for creators?</p>

<p>Recently a video surfaced from someone claiming that certain USB-to-Ethernet dongles contained ‚Äòmalware‚Äô among other big claims. Basically these dongles were said to be designed by China (and Russia) to spy on users and so on, but how much of this is actually grounded in reality? When [lcamtuf] dove into the topic, what he found was not so much a smoking gun, but rather a curious relic from the era when drivers-on-CD were being phased out.</p>

		<p>In the realm of DevOps, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are crucial for automating software development workflows. One of the most popular tools for CI/CD is <strong>Jenkins</strong>. This blog provides a beginner-friendly introduction to Jenkins, its features, benefits, and a step-by-step guide to getting started.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-jenkins">What is Jenkins?</h2>
<p><strong>Jenkins</strong> is an open-source automation server written in Java. It helps automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications, making it an integral part of DevOps practices. With its extensive plugin ecosystem, Jenkins supports integration with almost any tool or platform.</p>

<p>Buried in a talk on AI from an artist who is doing cutting-edge video work was the following nugget that entirely sums up the zeitgeist: ‚ÄúThe tools are changing so fast that artists can‚Äôt keep up with them, let alone master them, before everyone is on to the next.‚Äù And while you might think that this concern is only relevant to those who have to stay on the crest of the hype wave, the deeper question resounds with every hacker.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many industries, and software development is no exception. By automating repetitive tasks, optimizing processes, and providing data-driven insights, AI tools have significantly enhanced productivity and efficiency. However, despite its many benefits, AI-driven workflows come with certain limitations that developers and organizations must understand to make the most of these technologies. In this article, we will explore some of the most significant challenges that AI workflows face in the realm of software development.</p>
