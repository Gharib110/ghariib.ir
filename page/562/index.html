<p>A little while back, a bug with the LVM encrypted install in Kali Linux 1.0.4 was <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=443">reported</a> in our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/submitting-issues-kali-bug-tracker/">bug tracker</a>. This bug was high priority in our TODO as encrypted installs are an important feature in our industry so we wanted to squash this bug ASAP. This article will describe the process of debugging, identifying, and fixing this bug in Kali, and ultimately in Debian as well.</p>

<p>Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for cryptographic security. These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their outgoing message with that public key.</p>

<p>Whenever we are given the opportunity to describe Kali Linux, we use the word “<strong>powerful</strong>”. Have you ever wondered or asked yourself why exactly we consider Kali to be so “Powerful”? Why is Kali any different or better from say, an Ubuntu machine with a bunch of security tools preinstalled on it? After all, <strong>our nmap package isn’t any better than anyone else’s, is it</strong>?</p>
