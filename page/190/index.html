		<p>It has been five years since we first introduced <code>debuginfod</code>, a tool for distributing debugging resources such as executables, debug information, and source files. Since then we have continued to improve <code>debuginfod</code> as well as tools that make use of <code>debuginfod</code>, such as GDB and Valgrind.</p>
<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll review some of the notable updates and enhancements to <code>debuginfod</code> over the past year as well as the scale at which public <code>debuginfod</code> servers are operating.</p>

		<p>The DeepINTEL 2024 security intelligence has begun. The day holds a full day of presentation about current and future threats. It is difficult to describe a TLP:AMBER event, because we do not publish the schedule for DeepINTEL. The term security intelligence has a wide spectrum. Basically, it includes all informations that will help you improve your defence, understand your adversaries, and how attacking groups operate. The sources are probes, monitoring systems, reports from attacks and their analysis. We are looking forward to provide the next iteration of DeepINTEL as a unique forum where security experts can get crucial updates. Grab your coffee, listen, and contribute!</p>

		<p>DeepSec 2024 ended on 22 November 2024. We took a week off to post-process the event in terms of video material and dialogues. Usually only participants get first access to the video recordings, but because of the threat of disinformation from nation states, we published the keynote early and freely. Randahl Fink explained his take on manipulation of elections and entire societies. Russia, among others, is very proficient in creating election results that keep on surprising politicians and analysts alike. The Mind Bomb is real, and it is about to explode in Western democracies. You can watch the video online on Randahl’s YouTube channel, his Patreon site, or on our Vimeo account. Presenters at conferences are storytellers. They make topics come alive, create links between seemingly unrelated aspects, teach new knowledge, and hopefully make</p>

		<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, securing software systems has never been more critical. Cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, leading to widespread damage and disruption. That said, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) helped shape best practices for the technology industry with their Secure-by-Design pledge. Cloudflare signed this pledge on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle.</p>

<p>New year, new menaces for cyber defenders. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a novel variant of the notorious Banshee Stealer, which is increasingly targeting Apple users worldwide. This stealthy infostealer malware employs advanced evasion techniques, successfully slipping past detection by leveraging string encryption from Apple’s XProtect antivirus engine. Going exclusively after macOS users, Banshee is capable of stealing browser credentials, login data, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information from the files.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Doubly Efficient Fuzzy Private Set Intersection for High-dimensional Data with Cosine Similarity</strong><br>
<em>Hyunjung Son, Seunghun Paik, Yunki Kim, Sunpill Kim, Heewon Chung, Jae Hong Seo</em></p>
<p>Fuzzy private set intersection (Fuzzy PSI) is a cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving similarity matching, which is one of the essential operations in various real-world applications such as facial authentication, information retrieval, or recommendation systems. Despite recent advancements in fuzzy PSI protocols, still a huge barrier remains in deploying them for these applications. The main obstacle is the high dimensionality, e.g., from 128 to 512, of data; lots of existing methods, Garimella et al. (CRYPTO’23, CRYPTO’24) or van Baarsen et al. (EUROCRYPT’24), suffer from exponential overhead on communication and/or computation cost. In addition, the dominant similarity metric in these applications is cosine similarity, which disables several optimization tricks based on assumptions for the distribution of data, e.g., techniques by Gao et al. (ASIACRYPT’24). In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy PSI protocol for cosine similarity, called FPHE, that overcomes these limitations at the same time. FPHE features linear complexity on both computation and communication with respect to the dimension of set elements, only requiring much weaker assumption than prior works. The basic strategy of ours is to homomorphically compute cosine similarity and run an approximated comparison function, with a clever packing method for efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel proof technique to harmonize the approximation error from the sign function with the noise flooding, proving the security of FPHE under the semi-honest model. Moreover, we show that our construction can be extended to support various functionalities, such as labeled or circuit fuzzy PSI. Through experiments, we show that FPHE can perform fuzzy PSI over 512-dimensional data in a few minutes, which was computationally infeasible for all previous proposals under the same assumption as ours.</p>

Enlightenment 0.27, released this week, brings a wealth of incremental improvements to users of this unique desktop environment. Though not as well known or widely used as GNOME, Xfce, KDE Plasma, et al, Enlightenment (often abbreviated as just ‘E’) differentiates itself through the use of Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). An assembly of modules, Enlightenment offers a lightweight window manager, compositor, and desktop shell built using Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), plus a small set of native EFL-based apps including a file manager, photo viewer, and terminal. Enlightenment’s aesthetics aren’t to everyone’s tastes (it’d be a boring world if it did; most […]</p>
