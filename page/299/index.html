		<p>Will these add-ons make you switch to Sheets from Excel?</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel is undoubtedly one of the most powerful apps out there to work with numbers. However, it requires an Office 365 subscription or an Office 2024 purchase, which isn&rsquo;t feasible for a lot of users. If you don&rsquo;t want to shell out money, a good alternative to Excel is Google Sheets. Not only is it free to use, but it is also a simpler version for students with less intimidating features and options. Moreover, you also get a plethora of templates and features like extensions for added functionality.</p>

		<p>In today&rsquo;s competitive landscape, businesses must innovate quickly and deliver exceptional customer value. AWS DevOps has emerged as a powerful enabler, combining the best practices of development and operations with the scalability and reliability of the AWS cloud.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-awsdevops">What is AWS DevOps?</h2>
<p>AWS DevOps integrates tools, automation, and cultural practices to streamline software development and deployment. By leveraging AWS services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CloudFormation, teams can implement continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), automate infrastructure provisioning, and improve collaboration between developers and operations teams.</p>

<p>This is the third article on Building a SaaS with Ruby on Rails. This article continues where the previous one, adding sign up to Rails 8&rsquo; authentication, stops.</p>
<p>Most SaaS products are used by multiple people from the same team or company. Although I would, when you start building your SaaS, urge you to keep it simple and just support one user on launch. I would álso urge you to build the blocks needed for teams in your app from the get-go. Having to deal with workspaces, teams and roles when you already have users is a bigger pain than you can imagine.</p>

		<p>One of the first things everyone predicted when artificial intelligence (AI) became more commonplace was that it would assist cybercriminals in making their phishing campaigns more effective.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have conducted a scientific study into the effectiveness of AI supported spear phishing, and the results line up with everyone’s expectations: AI is making it easier to do crimes.</p>
<p>The study, titled Evaluating Large Language Models’ Capability to Launch Fully Automated Spear Phishing Campaigns: Validated on Human Subjects, evaluates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to conduct personalized phishing attacks and compares their performance with human experts and AI models from last year.</p>

		<p>We discovered a new stealer in the wild called &lsquo;&ldquo;Ailurophile Stealer”. The stealer is coded in PHP and the source code indicates potential Vietnamese origins. It is available for purchase through a subscription model via its own webpage. Through the website&rsquo;s web panel, its customers are provided the ability to customize and generate malware stubs.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/an-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-in-linux/">An overview of virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) in Linux</a></h1>
	<b><time>08.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<a href="/tags/tech">tech</a>
	
	<div>
		<p>Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is a network virtualization technique allowing traffic isolation at the layer 3 (L3) of the OSI model by creating independent routing and forwarding domains. It is essentially the combination of a separate routing table and associated network interfaces.</p>
<p>Other networking techniques exist but are operating at a different levels—such as VLAN and network namespaces, respectively at the layer 2 and at the device level. Those techniques can be combined, e.g., a VRF can be part of a network namespace and/or VLANs can be attached to a VRF. Note that a network namespace might look like a way to emulate a VRF but they differ in how traffic is handled, notably VRF does not impact layer 2 (L2) traffic.</p>

<p>The autonomous SOC: A well-grounded vision for the future of machine speed, AI-driven cyber defense, or nothing more than a pipe dream? Few concepts in modern security have been as polarizing, with sides painted as distinct camps of “believers” versus “non-believers”, each accompanied by increasingly hyperbolic claims.</p>
<p>At SentinelOne, you will hear us and our customers talk about the autonomous SOC and the fundamental shifts it will bring to day-to-day security operations. Today, we want to be clear about what we mean when we say that.</p>
