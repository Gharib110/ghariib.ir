		<p>Explore SentinelLabs&rsquo; take on what 2025 may bring for cybersecurity, including emerging trends and actionable insights.</p>
<p>Crystal balls are notoriously fragile, and those who look into them are wise not to become fixated with the shadows cast by their refracted light, yet no business can function without some meaningful sense of what the future might hold. Reading the tea leaves of the past can offer no insight into novel and unexpected events to come, but it can help us prepare for that which is already forming in the shadows. Ultimately, the entire point of intelligence is to enable forward-looking decisions, and this means we’ll hit the mark with some and miss with others.</p>

–Read the Full Story in Forbes</em></p>
<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 6, 2025</p>
<p>A Forbes story reports that cybersecurity skills are highly coveted, as the digital landscape faces unprecedented threats and skyrocketing costs associated with cybercrimes. By 2025, global cybercrime costs are projected to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion annually, according to a report by Cybercrime Magazine.</p>
<p>This surge in cybercrime is accompanied by a severe shortage of qualified professionals in the field. The cybersecurity job market is expected to grow by 33 percent between 2023 and 2033, with an estimated 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions worldwide by the end of 2025.</p>

		<p>A loose collective of mostly low-skilled actors, CyberVolk absorbs and adapts a wide array of destructive malware for use against political targets.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>CyberVolk/GLORIAMIST is a hacktivist collective originating in India with pro-Russia leanings. Between June and October 2024, CyberVolk claimed responsibility for multiple ransomware attacks.</li>
<li>The main objective of CyberVolk and related groups is to leverage geopolitical issues to launch and justify attacks on public and government entities, primarily in the service of Russian government interests.</li>
<li>SentinelLabs has observed a shared codebase used by CyberVolk, AzzaSec and DoubleFace’s ransomware. Additionally, CyberVolk has promoted other ransomware families like HexaLocker and Parano. These groups and the tools they leverage are all closely intertwined.</li>
<li>These hacktivist groups are extremely dynamic and volatile. In-fighting, threats, and inflated political-posturing are common, leading to fragmentation and the rapid re-shaping of the hacktivist threat landscape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>CyberVolk is a politically motivated hacktivist collective which launched its own RaaS in June 2024. The group uses both DDoS and ransomware attacks in its efforts to undermine and disrupt the operations of those opposed to Russian interests.</p>

<p>In this Data Science blog post series, we’ve talked about where to get data from and how to explore that data using pandas, but whilst that data is excellent for learning, it’s not similar to what we will term <em>real-world</em> data. Data for learning has often already been cleaned and curated to allow you to learn quickly without needing to venture into the world of data cleaning, but real-world data has problems and is messy. Real-world data needs cleaning before it can give us useful insights, and that’s the subject of this blog post. </p>

<p>Wish I could know who drew the cover image. It&rsquo;s very well done. Would suggest you to check out their work, but sadly not even I know.</p>
<p>Moving on, I wanted to write about what I&rsquo;m going through. This is by no means an exhaustive research made alongside a mental health professional, and I&rsquo;m not looking for anything that will be written here to be of any utility to anybody. It doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be that. It&rsquo;s merely a blog post of someone who wishes to start 2025 in good spirits, avoiding the pitfalls, so that it becomes the professional it seeks to be.</p>

<p>The Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime Unit apprehended Turkish national Hakan Zanburkan in Bangladesh on Tuesday. Agartala’s Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) Hospital and Agartala Government Medical College (AGMC) were able to eject Hakan’s captive with the aid of the local folks from Tripura.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several other members of an international ATM card cloning syndicate were also arrested in Bangladesh alongside him on Thursday, according to a police officer at Agartala. Agartala’s AGMC and GBP Hospitals had allowed the under-trial Hakan to escape through a window during a health check-up while security lapses existed.</p>

<p>I do. The answer is &hellip; it depends 😋 It varies between browsers and it’s a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>Before I show you the screenshots, let me first tell you a short story about how I ended up in the <em>“lets-download-this-file-102-times”</em> rabbit hole so bear with me.</p>
