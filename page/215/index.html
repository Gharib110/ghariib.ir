		<p>You can still teach an old dog new tricks.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is set to fall out of support in October of this year, with Microsoft declaring that users should upgrade to Windows 11 to avoid loss of service. However, it seems the Redmond giant is still not done with adding features to an operating system less than a year from leaving service. In the newest beta build, Microsoft has slipped in some new additions to the Calendar tool to make it a little more lively.</p>

<p>A new malware campaign has compromised more than 5,000 WordPress sites to create admin accounts, install a malicious plugin, and steal data.</p>
<p>Researchers at webscript security company c/side discovered during an incident response engagement for one of their clients that the malicious activity uses the wp3[.]xyz domain to exfiltrate data but have yet to determine the initial infection vector.</p>
<p>After compromising a target, a malicious script loaded from the wp3[.]xyz domain creates the rogue admin account <em>wpx_admin</em> with credentials available in the code.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>ESET researchers recently disclosed <strong>CVE-2024-7344</strong>, a critical vulnerability that compromises <strong>UEFI Secure Boot</strong>, a cornerstone of firmware-level security for modern systems. This flaw affects a wide range of UEFI-based systems and enables the execution of untrusted code during the boot process, thus bypassing Secure Boot protections. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can deploy persistent and stealthy threats like <strong>Bootkits</strong> (e.g., <strong>Bootkitty</strong> and <strong>BlackLotus</strong>) even on devices with Secure Boot enabled, irrespective of the operating system.</p>
