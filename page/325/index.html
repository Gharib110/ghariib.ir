<p>DevOps, a fusion of “Development” and “Operations,” represents a cultural and professional movement that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration among all stakeholders involved in the development, operations, and delivery of software. By fostering a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, DevOps seeks to shorten the software development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software. This methodology is characterized by a continuous cycle of integration, delivery, and deployment, which helps organizations adapt quickly to changing market demands and improve overall efficiency.</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced software development environment, DevOps plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between development and operations. To ensure smooth deployment cycles, optimal performance, and system reliability, monitoring, and observability are key components of the DevOps practice. Elastic, renowned for its Elastic Stack (previously known as the ELK Stack), is leveraging advanced observability tools to enhance DevOps workflows. In this blog, we will delve into how Elastic is incorporating DevOps in monitoring and observability, offering innovative solutions for enhanced visibility and performance tracking across systems.</p>

<p>DevOps and platform engineering are essential disciplines that provide immense value in the realm of cloud-native technology and software delivery. However, these practices cannot stand alone. Rather, they must be bolstered by additional technological investments to ensure reliability, security, and efficiency. One of these key investments includes observability.</p>
<p>Observability of applications and infrastructure serves as a critical foundation for DevOps and platform engineering, offering a comprehensive view into system performance and behavior. It goes beyond traditional monitoring—metrics, logs, and traces—to encompass topology mapping, code-level details, and user experience metrics that provide real-time insights. This real-time awareness enables teams to rapidly detect and resolve issues: both indispensable capabilities for maintaining the agility and reliability that are central to DevOps and platform engineering processes.</p>

<p>Red Hat and Dynatrace are joining forces to revolutionize day-one and day-two operations. A tight integration between Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Dynatrace Davis® AI, and the Dynatrace observability and security platform enables closed-loop remediation to automate the process from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting a problem</li>
<li>Managing incidents in corresponding tools</li>
<li>Identifying the root cause and proper countermeasures</li>
<li>Executing corrective actions</li>
<li>Keeping relevant stakeholders in the loop</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, disruptions are minimized, MTTR is significantly decreased, and DevSecOps and SREs collaborate efficiently to boost productivity.</p>

<p>Urban populations are expected to account for 68% of the global population, putting unprecedented strain on cities’ infrastructure. This rapid urbanisation is exposing critical gaps that compromise residents’ quality of life, from inefficient essential services to grid and water-management deficiencies. The implications are particularly profound for underserved communities, where infrastructure and basic services may already be lacking. Municipal leaders, policymakers, and sustainability directors are now grappling with the challenge of ensuring their cities evolve in a way that is both technologically advanced and equitable and inclusive.</p>
