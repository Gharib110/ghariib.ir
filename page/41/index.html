	<div>
		<p>The emergence of containerization has brought about a significant transformation in software development and deployment by providing a consistent and scalable environment on many platforms. For developers trying to optimize their operations, Docker in particular has emerged as the preferred technology.  By using containers as the foundation, developers gain the same key benefits — portability, scalability, efficiency, and security — that they rely on for other workloads, seamlessly extending them to ML and AI applications. Using a real-world example involving a Snake AI game, we’ll examine in this article how TensorFlow.js can be used with Docker to run AI/ML in a web browser.</p>

		<p>With the help of the following command, you can easily find top 10 processes that are consuming high memory on any Linux system. <code>ps</code> is the default command available in most of Linux operating system that provide details about running processes and resource utilization details in the system. Open a terminal and execute following command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ps -eo pid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head
</code></pre><p>Output will print top 10 processes that are consuming high memory on your system in descending order. You can also use top command to filter processes by memory utilization.</p>

<p>In this blog, we discuss how malware authors recently utilized a popular new trend to entice unsuspecting users into installing malware. This blog is meant as a reminder to stay cautious during a hype cycle. It’s a common trap and pitfall for unassuming consumers. </p>

		<p>It’s a new year, but before we look forward to breaking all of our resolutions, let’s pause to take a look at the year that was for Trend Zero Day Initiative™ (ZDI).</p>
<p><strong>Pwn2Own Competitions Keep Exceeding Expectations</strong></p>
<p>Even though we just completed Pwn2Own Automotive 2025, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the inaugural edition that occurred in January 2024. That contest brought together some of the best automotive researchers around the globe to the biggest (literally) Pwn2Own stage in history. The event garnered more participation than expected, as we awarded a record-setting amount of $1,323,750 for the discovery of 49 unique zero-day vulnerabilities across the three days of competition. From there, we moved on to Vancouver, where Manfred Paul wowed us all by hacking Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari on his way to winning Master of Pwn. That event awarded $1,132,500 for 29 unique 0-days and also saw the first Docker escape at a Pwn2Own event. We ended by moving to Ireland and our Cork offices. This contest also saw the end of remote participation and required all contestants to be onsite. Over the four days of the contest, we awarded $1,066,625 for over 70 0-day vulnerabilities. That means Pwn2Own awarded over $3,500,000 in 2024 for 148 unique 0-days.</p>

<p>Do you like high-detail 3D models intended for resin printing, but wish you could more easily print them on a filament-based FDM printer? Good news, because [Jacob] of <em>Painted4Combat</em> shared a tool he created to make 3D models meant for resin printers — the kind popular with tabletop gamers — easier to port to FDM. It comes in the form of a Blender add-on called <em>Resin2FDM.</em> Intrigued, but wary of your own lack of experience with Blender? No problem, because he also made a video that walks you through the whole thing step-by-step.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In early December 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence detected a large-scale malvertising campaign that impacted nearly one million devices globally in an opportunistic attack to steal information. The attack originated from illegal streaming websites embedded with malvertising redirectors, leading to an intermediary website where the user was then redirected to GitHub and two other platforms. The campaign impacted a wide range of organizations and industries, including both consumer and enterprise devices, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of the attack.</p>

</p>
<p>Every attack leaves a trail, but in containerized environments, this trail can evaporate before you even realize you have been attacked. These environments bring new challenges for security teams, including an expanding attack surface. Containers, while incredibly powerful, are short-lived, and attackers exploit this by moving quickly and covering their tracks. They often download and execute malware, then silently modify, or delete the files to erase evidence of their actions, making it nearly impossible to trace the original attack. Security teams are often left scrambling to piece together what happened.</p>
