	<div>
		<p>Network optimization with Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) and Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV) is widely supported and adopted in Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. In this article, we will present a means of automatically deploying an open source Cloud-Native Network Function (CNF), called Example-CNF, in order to test particular Telco-related configurations and scenarios, leveraging DPDK&rsquo;s capabilities within containerized environments.</p>
<p>Example-CNF is a workload to exercise both DPDK and SR-IOV technologies for Telco setups. The project is composed of several Kubernetes operators built with open source toolkits, such as Operator SDK, using Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) images pushed to Quay.io, deploying two main components:</p>

		<p>Microsoft observes more than 600 million ransomware, phishing, and identity attacks each day.¹ One major theme from our analysis of these attacks is clear—organizations with integrated tools have better visibility and more holistic defense than those using a broader portfolio of point solutions. Microsoft wanted to test this observation outside of its own telemetry, hiring Foundry to conduct a survey of senior-level IT decision makers with a primary role in security management at organizations with 500 or more employees to see what they’re experiencing.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>After co-opting the tools and infrastructure of another nation-state threat actor to facilitate espionage activities, as detailed in our last blog, Russian nation-state actor Secret Blizzard used those tools and infrastructure to compromise targets in Ukraine. Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed that these campaigns consistently led to the download of Secret Blizzard’s custom malware, with the Tavdig backdoor creating the foothold to install their KazuarV2 backdoor.</p>
<p>Between March and April 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed Secret Blizzard using the Amadey bot malware relating to cybercriminal activity that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1919 to download its backdoors to specifically selected target devices associated with the Ukrainian military. This was at least the second time since 2022 that Secret Blizzard has used a cybercrime campaign to facilitate a foothold for its own malware in Ukraine. Microsoft also assesses that in January 2024, Secret Blizzard used the backdoor of Storm-1837, a Russia-based threat actor that targets Ukrainian military drone pilots, to download the Tavdig and KazuarV2 backdoors on a target device in Ukraine.</p>
