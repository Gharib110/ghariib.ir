<p>As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems become more prevalent, their ability to make decisions that impact our lives ‚Äî ranging from healthcare diagnoses to loan approvals ‚Äî has grown exponentially. However, the complexity of these systems often makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust, ethical concerns, and regulatory challenges. Testing for explainability in AI/ML is a critical practice that ensures these systems provide clear, understandable, and interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. By prioritizing explainability, organizations can build trust, ensure compliance, and create AI/ML systems that are both powerful and accountable.</p>

		<p>The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is decentralized blockchain technology, it is secure and transparent which provides an alternative to centralized internet cloud providers.</p>
<p>ICP maintains an independent data center that aims to bring efficient data, speed, and decentralization to computation and data storage. Internet Computer protocol uses ICP as its native cryptocurrency which is used to pay transaction fees, rewards, incentives, and other transactions. Users can build their DApps on ICP, which allows developers to write their smart contracts in different popular languages like Rust, TypeScript, or Python. The smart contract is regarded as canisters which are hosted on an ICP blockchain network called subnet.</p>

</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are leveraging artificial intelligence to launch phishing attacks that are more sophisticated, convincing, and dangerous than ever before. These AI-generated scams go beyond traditional techniques, creating highly personalized messages that mimic the tone, style, and context of real-world communications. Executives, in particular, are prime targets for these attacks, as they hold the keys to sensitive information and decision-making power within their organizations.</p>

<p>Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language developed by Google in 2009 üìÜ. It has gained popularity over the years due to its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability üíª. When it comes to microservice development, Go stands out from other programming languages because of its unique features that make it an ideal choice for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems üåà. In this blog post, we will explore the top 10 features of Go that make it perfect for microservice development.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>dCTIDH: Fast &amp; Deterministic CTIDH</strong><br>
<em>Fabio Campos, Andreas Hellenbrand, Michael Meyer, Krijn Reijnders</em></p>
<p>This paper presents dCTIDH, a CSIDH implementation that combines two recent developments into a novel state-of-the-art deterministic implementation. We combine the approach of deterministic variants of CSIDH with the batching strategy of CTIDH, which shows that the full potential of this key space has not yet been explored. This high-level adjustment in itself leads to a significant speed-up. To achieve an effective deterministic evaluation in constant time, we introduce Wombats, a new approach to performing isogenies in batches, specifically tailored to the behavior required for deterministic CSIDH using CTIDH batching.</p>

<p>Docking stations can be a great way to expand the capabilities of the devices you already own. While docking stations are usually paired up with laptops, you can also use them for tablets, PC gaming handhelds, and smartphones as well. Of course, if you&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for one, chances are, you&rsquo;ve seen how pricey they can be.</p>

		<p>Be careful where you click.</p>
<p>A few years ago, it became a &ldquo;life hack&rdquo; to add the word &ldquo;Reddit&rdquo; at the end of a search term for something you want help with (at least, before Google began serving Reddit posts higher than usual). The idea is that whatever problem you have, there are ten Reddit threads from days past that have threads full of troubleshooting tips, advice, solutions, and tools to fix your issue. Well, it seems that the life hack is being used against us, as scammers now use fake Reddit websites to peddle malware.</p>
