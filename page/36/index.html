		<p><em>This is the third and penultimate post in a series about theoretical weaknesses in Fiat-Shamir as applied to proof systems. The first post is here, the second post is here, and you should probably read them.</em></p>
<p>Over the past two posts I’ve given a bit of background on four subjects: (1) interactive proof systems (for general programs/circuits), (2) the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, (3) random oracles. We’ve also talked about (4) recursive proofs, which will be important but are not <em>immediately</em> relevant.</p>

<p>Messed up or mistakenly deleted configuration files under <code>/etc</code> directory, but no backup? Here’s how to restore the files just like they were originally installed.</p>
<p>In Linux, the <code>/etc</code> directory is the location for storing system-wide configuration files. When installing a software package, it may create and/or read software specific config files under <code>/etc</code> directory for user custom configurations.</p>
<p>To prevent overriding user custom configurations, re-install software packages by default will NOT replace the files under <code>/etc</code> directory, even when you deleted the files under that directory. Though, some packages will ask if keep or replace the old configurations during installation.</p>

		<blockquote>
<p><strong>February 14, 2025:</strong> This post was updated with the recommendation to restrict S3 bucket access to an IAM role by using the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> condition key instead of the <code>aws:userid</code> condition key.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>April 2, 2021</strong>: In the section “Granting cross-account bucket access to a specific IAM role,” we updated the second policy to fix an error.</p></blockquote>

<hr>
<p>Customers often ask how to limit access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to only a specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. A popular approach has been to use the <code>Principal</code> element to list the users or roles who need access to the bucket. However, the <code>Principal</code> element needs the exact values of the <code>user</code> ARN, <code>role</code> ARN, or <code>assumed-role</code> ARN. It does not support using a wildcard (*) to include all role sessions, nor does it allow you to use policy variables.</p>

		<p>About one in three organizations that leverage cloud service providers (CSPs) use Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to November 2024 research from Synergy Research Group. This means two things. One is that when attackers are looking to get the most out of a single exploit, they will likely craft them to target AWS systems. And two, that AWS data security best practices are a timely topic for a wide range of today&rsquo;s organizations.

	<div>
		<p>Monitoring your systems doesn’t have to be a chore. If you’re running an Ubuntu server and want to keep tabs on performance metrics—like CPU usage, memory, or disk I/O—Prometheus and Grafana are a dream team. Prometheus collects the data, and Grafana turns it into beautiful, easy-to-read dashboards. I’ve set this up a few times myself, and while it might seem daunting at first, it’s pretty straightforward once you break it down. Let’s walk through it together, step by step, and get your monitoring stack running on Ubuntu.</p>

		<p>VLAN trunking is the easiest way to pass VLAN traffic through multiple switches.</p>
<p>As your home network expands, so do the burdens of administering the list of network appliances. Maybe you&rsquo;ve expanded the number of wired devices in your network, and added additional managed network switches to segregate your house into VLANs for easier management and better security. The question then is how to get tagged VLAN traffic to the other endpoint devices in your network.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities—but it’s also a favorite playground for scammers.  </p>
<p>With the rapid rise of deepfake technology and deceptive AI-driven schemes, even seasoned investors can fall victim to fraud. According to McAfee’s <em>State of the Scamiverse</em> report, deepfake scams are on the rise, with the average American now encountering 2.6 deepfake videos daily. And younger adults (18-24) see even more – about 3.5 per day. </p>
<p>From fake investment opportunities to phishing attempts, bad actors are more sophisticated than ever.  </p>

		<p>Why crypto exchanges struggle to guard against targeted attacks, and how to store cryptocurrency threat-free.</p>
<p>February 21 was a dark day for the crypto market as it suffered the largest heist in its history. Attackers made off with around $1.5 billion from Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, with experts citing it as the biggest theft – of anything – of all time. Although neither this loss nor the withdrawal of a further $5 billion by panicked investors were fatal for Bybit, the incident underscores the fundamental flaws in the modern crypto ecosystem, and serves up some valuable lessons for regular users.</p>

		<p>When hackers started using automation and AI, traditional cybersecurity stopped being enough. During the past years, security teams focused more on proactively searching for hidden threats and stopping their escalation. And this is exactly what threat hunting does. Instead of waiting for an alert, security experts investigate unusual behavior, correlate data, and uncover hidden attacks. […]</p>
