		<p>Recently, I came across a fantastic new paper by a group of NYU and Cornell researchers entitled “How to think about end-to-end encryption and AI.” I’m extremely grateful to see this paper, because while I don’t agree with <em>every single one</em> of it’s conclusions, it’s a good first stab at an incredibly important set of questions.</p>
<p>I was particularly glad to see this paper, but this exact topic has been very much on my mind this past few months. On the one hand, my interest stems from the rapid deployment of new AI assistant systems like Google’s scam call protection and Apple Intelligence, both of which aim to put AI basically everywhere on your phone — even, potentially, right in the middle of your encrypted messages. On the other hand, it comes from a recent European debate over “mandatory content scanning” laws that would require AI to scan virtually every private message you send.</p>

A major new release of Linux Mint is now available to download. Linux Mint 22.1 is the first update in the Linux Mint 22.x series and, like that version, is built on top of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and uses Linux Kernel 6.8 (though the distro plans to release newer kernel updates more often by opting-in to the Ubuntu HWE). Being based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS means Linux Mint 22.1 receives on-going updates until July 2029. Though it features few foundational changes, Linux Mint 22.1 brings improvements to what sits on top – a new version of the Cinnamon desktop, Wayland-friendly features, new […]</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t like AI tools? Well, now you&rsquo;re paying for them anyway.</p>
<p>How much do you use the Copilot features on Microsoft 365? If your answer to that is &ldquo;not a lot,&rdquo; then there&rsquo;s some bad news on the horizon. Your monthly bill for using the service is about to go up, and it&rsquo;s likely due to the addition of AI services across the platform. Worst of all, you can&rsquo;t opt out of this price rise, either; everyone is getting hit by it regardless of how much they use (or want) Copilot.</p>

		<p>2025 is upon us! We’re ringing in the new year with – you guessed it – another Patch Tuesday. This year’s curtains open with 159 fixes, eight zero-days, and 12 critical flaws. 58 of the flaws found could result in Remote Code Execution. The following chart shows the number of vulnerabilities found in each category. […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Morgana: a laconic circuit builder</strong><br>
<em>Lev Soukhanov, Yaroslav Rebenko</em></p>
<p>We construct a novel SNARK proof system, Morgana. The main property of our system is its small circuit keys, which are proportional in size to the description of the circuit, rather than to the number of constraints.</p>
<p>Previously, a common approach to this problem was to first construct a universal circuit (colloquially known as a zk-VM), and then simulate an application circuit within it. However, this approach introduces significant overhead.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rsync, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Rsync is an open-source file synchronization and data transferring tool valued for its ability to perform incremental transfers, reducing data transfer times and bandwidth usage. The tool is utilized extensively by backup systems like Rclone, DeltaCopy, ChronoSync, public file distribution repositories, and cloud and server management operations. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

Sure, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) pays attention to cybersecurity, but by no means is it top of the agenda. Looking for a giant monitor or AI washing machine? You’re in luck!

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On Composing Generic Voting Schemes for Improved Privacy</strong><br>
<em>Oskar Goldhahn</em></p>
<p>Hybrid encryption provides a way for schemes to distribute trust among many computational assumptions, for instance by composing existing schemes. This is increasingly relevant as quantum computing advances because it lets us get the best of both worlds from the privacy of the post quantum schemes and the more battle tested classical schemes. We show how to compose members of a very general class of voting schemes and prove that this preserves correctness and integrity and improves privacy compared to its constituent parts. We also show an example composition using a lattice based decryption mixnet where the improvement in privacy can indirectly lead to an improvement in integrity.</p>
