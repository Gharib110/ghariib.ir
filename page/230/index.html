		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-55924<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 14, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 53 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically, this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, state-changing actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend, which can occur under the following conditions: The user opens a malicious link, such as one sent via email. The user visits a compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer` feature is disabled, 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to lax or none. The vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Scheduler Module” allows attackers to trigger pre-defined command classes - which can lead to unauthorized import or export of data in the worst case. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42 ELTS which fixes the problem described. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.0 | HIGH<br>

<p>ila: serialize calls to nf_register_net_hooks()</p>
<p>syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]</p>
<p>commit 031ae72825ce (&ldquo;ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner&rdquo;) attempted to fix a similar issue.</p>
<p>Looking at the syzbot repro, we have concurrent ILA_CMD_ADD commands.</p>
<p>Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 15, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 2 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions 2.2.85 to 2.3.3. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what user meta can be updated during profile registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register on the site as an administrator.<br>

IPv6 extension headers * are not supported with this feature. This feature * cannot be set in features for a device with * NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being * DEPRECATED (see below).</p>

A new stable release of Flatpak is out with a wealth of improvements in tow. Flatpak 1.16.0 is the first stable release in the new 1.16.x series, coming more than two years after the Flatpak 1.14.x cycle began and containing features, fixes, and other work undertaken from the 1.15.x development releases. Such as? Well, the way that Flatpak apps access USB devices is improved in Flatpak 1.16.x thanks to a new input device permission. Developer Georges Basile Stavracas notes that this is “technically still a sandbox hole that should be treated with caution” but enables apps to purposefully limit the scope […]</p>

<p>With Windows 10&rsquo;s end-of-year date approaching this October, people still using the operating system have been given a choice: upgrade to Windows 11 or lose support. People have devised solutions for the latter path, including third-party apps that will keep the OS secure. However, it seems that people sticking with Windows 10 will also lose Microsoft 365 support.</p>

		<p>Goodbye, BYOVD attacks.</p>
<p>Happy 2025! Microsoft has rolled out the first big updates for Windows 10 and 11 for the year, but don&rsquo;t get too excited. Across the board, we&rsquo;re seeing security fixes for the operating system, which, while very useful for warding off attacks, doesn&rsquo;t really get me excited to give it a spin. However, if you&rsquo;re a fan of Roblox, you may notice some issues playing it in the future.</p>

<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit.
