		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Morgana: a laconic circuit builder</strong><br>
<em>Lev Soukhanov, Yaroslav Rebenko</em></p>
<p>We construct a novel SNARK proof system, Morgana. The main property of our system is its small circuit keys, which are proportional in size to the description of the circuit, rather than to the number of constraints.</p>
<p>Previously, a common approach to this problem was to first construct a universal circuit (colloquially known as a zk-VM), and then simulate an application circuit within it. However, this approach introduces significant overhead.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rsync, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Rsync is an open-source file synchronization and data transferring tool valued for its ability to perform incremental transfers, reducing data transfer times and bandwidth usage. The tool is utilized extensively by backup systems like Rclone, DeltaCopy, ChronoSync, public file distribution repositories, and cloud and server management operations. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

<p>One of the world’s premier tech events traditionally takes place every year in Las Vegas in early January. Sure, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) pays attention to cybersecurity, but by no means is it top of the agenda. Looking for a giant monitor or AI washing machine? You’re in luck! Smart home protection against hackers? Might have to shop around a bit…</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On Composing Generic Voting Schemes for Improved Privacy</strong><br>
<em>Oskar Goldhahn</em></p>
<p>Hybrid encryption provides a way for schemes to distribute trust among many computational assumptions, for instance by composing existing schemes. This is increasingly relevant as quantum computing advances because it lets us get the best of both worlds from the privacy of the post quantum schemes and the more battle tested classical schemes. We show how to compose members of a very general class of voting schemes and prove that this preserves correctness and integrity and improves privacy compared to its constituent parts. We also show an example composition using a lattice based decryption mixnet where the improvement in privacy can indirectly lead to an improvement in integrity.</p>

		<p>The FBI says it has removed PlugX malware from thousands of infected computers worldwide.</p>
<p>The move came after suspicion that cybercriminals groups under control of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) used a version of PlugX malware to control, and steal information from victims’ computers.</p>
<p>PlugX has been around since at least 2008 but is under constant development. With the remote access it provides criminals, it is often used to spy on users and plant additional malware on interesting systems.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At Amazon Web Services (AWS), the security of our customers’ data is our top priority, and it always will be. Recently, the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) and our automated security monitoring systems identified an increase in unusual encryption activity associated with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.</p>
<p>Working with customers, our security teams detected an increase of data encryption events in S3 that used an encryption method known as <em>server-side encryption using client-provided keys (SSE-C)</em>. While this is a feature used by many customers, we detected a pattern where a large number of S3 <code>CopyObject</code> operations using SSE-C began to overwrite objects, which has the effect of re-encrypting customer data with a new encryption key. Our analysis uncovered that this was being done by malicious actors who had obtained valid customer credentials, and were using them to re-encrypt objects.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>PSMT: Private Segmented Membership Test for Distributed Record Linkage</strong><br>
<em>Nirajan Koirala, Jonathan Takeshita, Jeremy Stevens, Sam Martin, Taeho Jung</em></p>
<p>In various real-world situations, a client may need to verify whether specific data elements they possess are part of a set segmented among numerous data holders. To maintain user privacy, it’s essential that both the client’s data elements and the data holders’ sets remain encrypted throughout the process. Existing approaches like Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT), and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) face challenges in these contexts. They either require data holders to access the sets in plaintext, result in high latency when aggregating data from multiple holders, risk exposing the identity of the party with the matching element, cause a large communication overhead for multiple-element queries, or lead to high false positives.</p>
