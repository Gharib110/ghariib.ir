		<p>I recently completed building a Simple Calculator to help members calculate their distributions payable from OnePath. Every quarter or so, Onepath<br>
publishes a spreadsheet containing all the distributions payable for the managed funds which they sell. Customers have to go through the sheets, find their fund and copy the distribution cents per share, then do the calculation against the number of units they own.</p>

</p>
<p>I think this process is quite tedious and outdated. It would be ideal if Onepath has an app, but building apps is not their primary business.</p>

		<p>Most of the web already supports HTTPS: In fact, 93% of requests made by Firefox are already HTTPS. As a reminder, HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) fixes the security shortcoming of HTTP by creating a secure and encrypted connection. Oftentimes, when web applications enable encryption with HTTPS on their servers, legacy content may still contain references using HTTP, even though that content would also be available over a secure and encrypted connection. When such a document gets loaded over HTTPS but subresources like images, audio and video are loaded using HTTP, it is referred to as “mixed content”.</p>

<p>On April 13, 2022, 360Netlab first disclosed the <code>Fodcha</code> botnet. After our article was published, Fodcha suffered a crackdown from the relevant authorities, and its authors quickly responded by leaving <code>&quot;Netlab pls leave me alone I surrender&quot;</code> in an updated sample.No surprise, Fodcha&rsquo;s authors didn&rsquo;t really stop updating after the fraudulent surrender, and soon a new version was released.</p>
<p>In the new version, the authors of Fodcha redesigned the communication protocol and started to use <code>xxtea</code> and <code>chacha20</code> algorithms to encrypt sensitive resources and network communications to avoid detection at the file &amp; traffic level; at the same time, a dual-C2 scheme with <code>OpenNIC domain</code> as the primary C2 and <code>ICANN domain</code> as the backup C2 was adopted.</p>

<p>Recently, CNCERT and 360netlab worked together and discovered a rapidly spreading DDoS botnet on the Internet. The global infection looks fairly big as just in China there are more than 10,000 daily active bots (IPs) and alsomore than 100 DDoS victims beingtargeted on a daily basis. We named the botnet Fodcha because of its initial use of the C2 domain name folded.in and its use of the chacha algorithm to encrypt network traffic.</p>

<p>As 2024 ended, a new name surged to the top of the cyber threat charts: FunkSec. Emerging as a leading ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor, FunkSec made waves in December by publishing over 85 victim profiles on its Data Leak Site (DLS). However, beneath its apparent dominance lies a more complex and controversial story, as uncovered in Check Point Research’s (CPR) Global Threat Index for December 2024. FunkSec’s rapid ascent highlights the evolving tactics of RaaS operators. Utilizing artificial intelligence to scale operations, the group appears to rely heavily on AI-powered tools to generate ransomware and manage its double-extortion campaigns. While this […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Further Improvements in AES Execution over TFHE: Towards Breaking the 1 sec Barrier</strong><br>
<em>Sonia Belaïd, Nicolas Bon, Aymen Boudguiga, Renaud Sirdey, Daphné Trama, Nicolas Ye</em></p>
<p>Making the most of TFHE advanced capabilities such as programmable or circuit bootstrapping and their generalizations for manipulating data larger than the native plaintext domain of the scheme is a very active line of research. In this context, AES is a particularly interesting benchmark, as an example of a nontrivial algorithm which has eluded ``practical&rsquo;&rsquo; FHE execution performances for years, as well as the fact that it will most likely be selected by NIST as a flagship reference in its upcoming call on threshold (homomorphic) cryptography. Since 2023, the algorithm has thus been the subject of a renewed attention from the FHE community and has served as a playground to test advanced operators following the LUT-based, $p$-encodings or several variants of circuit bootstrapping, each time leading to further timing improvements. Still, AES is also interesting as a benchmark because of the tension between boolean- and byte-oriented operations within the algorithm. In this paper, we resolve this tension by proposing a new approach, coined ``hippo&rsquo;&rsquo;, which consistently combines the (byte-oriented) LUT-based approach with a generalization of the (boolean-oriented) $p$-encodings one to get the best of both worlds. In doing so, we obtain the best timings so far, getting a single-core execution of the algorithm over TFHE from $46$ down to $32$ seconds and approaching the $1$ second barrier with only a mild amount of parallelism. We should also stress that all the timings reported in this paper are consistently obtained on the same machine which is often not the case in previous studies. Lastly, we emphasize that the techniques we develop are applicable beyond just AES since the boolean-byte tension is a recurrent issue when running algorithms over TFHE.</p>

<p>On Oct 21, 2022, 360Netlab&rsquo;s honeypot system captured a suspicious ELF file <code>ee07a74d12c0bb3594965b51d0e45b6f</code>, which propagated via F5 vulnerability with zero VT detection, our system observces that it communicates with IP <code>45.9.150.144</code> using SSL with <strong>forged Kaspersky certificates</strong>, this caught our attention. After further lookup, we confirmed that this sample was adapted from the leaked Hive project server source code from CIA. <strong>This is the first time we caught a variant of the CIA HIVE attack kit in the wild</strong>, and we named it <code>xdr33</code> based on its embedded Bot-side certificate <code>CN=xdr33</code>.</p>
