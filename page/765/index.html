<p>Part I.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redblue.team/2015/09/spotting-adversary-with-windows-event_21.html">Update: Part 2 can be found here.</a></p>
<p>O.K. you have purchased a SIEM, added your Windows servers and you&rsquo;re ready to create your use-cases. You draw a blank. The amazing part about a SIEM is that you can build use-cases for literally thousands of scenarios. Unfortunately, however, the problem with a SIEM is that you have to create literally tens of thousands of alerts to monitor said use-cases. Monitoring for five failed logins followed by a successful login is great, but what good is the alert if the account locks after three failed attempts? Or if you have 10,000 users to monitor? To add to this, according to <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2013_en_xg.pdf">Verizon&rsquo;s 2013 Data Breach Report</a>, 76% of breaches involved stolen or weak credentials. So what to monitor for?</p>

<p>It seems that the generalist will likely go the way of the dinosaur as more specializations  and greater levels of complexity emerge (consequently requiring more ingenuity by a practitioner in any given area). This trend is observable in security firms that now segregate employees in increasing numbers of disparate groups with narrowing focus. Thomas Dixon began writing about this concept back in 1992 and I feel Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson have helped to rejuvenate the discussion in recent years. </p>

<p>There were a number of options that were extremely enticing (Dark Side Ops from Silent Break Security, Special Topics in Malware Analysis from Mandiant, Shellcode Lab, and of course the regular offerings from Saumil Shah, Dave Kennedy and many others). Ultimately I elected to take a course that would benefit me both personally and professionally in the near term.  I wanted to study something that would be challenging and interesting but that would immediately benefit me at my current job (and possibly help us to expand our business). </p>

<p>But it ended up going in another direction, with Martin discussing infosec leadership, and how we as agents of infosec should be &lsquo;guardrails&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;speed bumps&rsquo; to business processes and people. It was a great discussion from a veteran healthcare CISO, especially if you&rsquo;re thinking of pursuing a CISO or CSO management track.</p>

<p>One method is to triage your patches, and we discuss that this week with Mr. Boettcher. We also talk about how our respective company&rsquo;s handle patching of systems.</p>
<p>We also discuss what happens when compensating controls run out of effectiveness, and if there is a point at which they no longer are &lsquo;compensating&rsquo; for anything any further.</p>

<p>But what if there was a way to use compliance requirements to get beyond the baseline of PCI/SOCII/HIPAA, and get to be more secure?</p>
<p>Megan Wu (@tottenkoph), Mr. Boettcher, and I spent a bit of time discussing just that. We discuss basic issues with compliance frameworks, how to get management to buy-in to more security, and even how you can get Compliance people to help without them knowing it.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So we hit up our sponsor at Cybrary.it to discuss their end-user security training track and how companies can use it to help their employees to be more secure in their workplace.</p>
<p>We end the podcast with a bit of audio from the Bsides Austin blue/red panel Mr. Boettcher moderated. He asked them about training and it&rsquo;s worth. The first answer from Justin Whitehead is telling as to how he believes training will fail regardless. His answer was chilling in fact, and we hope to continue that conversation with him in the future about it.</p>

<p>Bob story: Bob was getting tired of explaining what MD5, SHA1, SHA2 were to developers, so as we were developing our idea for the podcast, this was the first episode we had. Mr. Boettcher had several ideas for podcasts prior to.</p>
<p>I was actually gonna go it alone, but wanted him to join me. Thankfully, he broached the idea of being on the podcast. This was actually the second take, as the first one was done in our office and we didn&rsquo;t want any legal issues doing it at work, so we trahed that one and made this version. I thought the first take was better, but what are gonna do&hellip; :)</p>
