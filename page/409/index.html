		<p>[ad] Well it was inevitable really, I’ve noticed in the last couple of years Phishing e-mails have started to use targeted lists especially for banking sites and the next up of course is trojans developed for specific regions. A security company Trusteer (who makes Rapport) has done some research on this matter which has pin-pointed […]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Regular expressions are powerful input validators and are especially so for formats that follow a predictable pattern, such as phone numbers. A well-constructed regex will ensure that the input is according to the expected format and reduces errors, hence improving data quality.</p>
<p>This article explores how the following regex is used in the validation of common phone number formats across Python, Java, and JavaScript:</p>
<h2 id="the-regular-expression">The Regular Expression</h2>
<p>Here is the common regular expression that helps you to validate common phone number formats.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When cable cuts occur, whether submarine or terrestrial, they often result in observable disruptions to Internet connectivity, knocking a network, city, or country offline. This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This post explores why even well-intentioned platform engineering initiatives tend to result in teams becoming larger than expected over time. It examines the drivers behind this growth trap and provides strategies for rightsizing based on organizational needs.</p>
<p>As more companies recognize the strategic importance of platform engineering, many are jumping in with the allure of starting small — the classic &ldquo;two-pizza team&rdquo; mindset. However, all too often these initiatives fall into the &ldquo;platform trap&rdquo; — where teams continuously grow way beyond initial projections. At Giant Swarm, we&rsquo;ve seen this play out time and again.</p>

		<p>Cloudflare’s AI Audit dashboard allows you to easily understand how AI companies and services access your content. AI Audit gives a summary of request counts broken out by bot, detailed path summaries for more granular insights, and the ability to filter by categories like <strong>AI Search</strong> or <strong>AI Crawler</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going one step further. You can now quickly see which AI services are honoring your robots.txt policies, which aren’t, and then programmatically enforce these policies. </p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Since containers became hot, there are fewer scenarios where IT professionals have to deal with virtual machines (VMs) in their day jobs, but from time to time you need something that’s hard or impossible to replicate inside a container and virtualization tools remain a crucial part of a developer’s toolbox.</p>
<p>Early container tools created huge security concerns: any user would be an effective root user, and those tools made it easy to run arbitrary code and circumvent protections provided by mechanisms such as SELinux and Linux kernel capabilities. Later container tools, such as Podman, emphasized rootless modes of operation to prevent such security concerns.</p>

<p>Ruby, the free open-source high-level general-purpose programming language, released new 3.4.0 (then 3.4.1 with quick fix) today at Christmas!</p>
<p>The release introduced <code>it</code> block parameter reference, which behaves very much the same as <code>_1</code>. As the feature request descripted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><code>it</code> is implemented as a special case of <code>getlocal</code> insn, not a method. <code>it</code> without an argument is considered <code>_1</code> or a normal local variable if defined. <code>it</code> is considered a method call only when it has any positional/keyword/block arguments.</em></p>

		<p>It’s been quite a while since we’ve posted any news about Russia, so here’s an article which in some ways is quite scary. The global cybercrime market is being dominated by Russian-speaking nations and their activity doubled in 2011. It’s certainly a disproportionate amount of crime when you look at their population size. Cybercrime is […]</p>
