<p>I was going to write about how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; with the HIBP API, but somehow, that term doesn&rsquo;t really seem appropriate any more for a service of this scale. On the contrary, we&rsquo;re putting in huge amounts of effort to get this thing fast, stable, and sustainable. We could do the first two very easily just by throwing money at the cloud, but that makes the last one a bit hard. Besides, both StefÃ¡nÂ and I do enjoy the challenge of optimising an increasingly large system to run on a shoestring and even though the days of &ldquo;a coffee a day of running costs&rdquo; are well behind us, arguably the cost per request (or some other usage-based metric) is better than ever. I hope you enjoy this chat between the two of us and as I say in the video, do please chime in with your thoughts and suggestions.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is a list of my <em>favourite</em> breaches from this year as that&rsquo;s a bit of a disingenuous term, but oh boy were there some memorable ones. So many of the incidents I deal with are relatively benign in terms of either the data they expose or the nature of the service, but some of them this year were absolute zingers. This week, I&rsquo;m talking about the ones that really stuck out to me for one reason or another, here&rsquo;s the top 5:</p>

<p>A super quick intro today as I rush off to do the next very Dubai thing: drive a Lambo through the desert to go dirt bike riding before jumping in a Can-Am off-roader and then heading to the kart track for a couple of afternoon sessions. I post lots of pics to my Facebook account, and if none of that is interesting, here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s video on more infosec-related topics:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back in Oslo! Writing this the day after recording, it feels like I couldn&rsquo;t be further from Dubai; the temperature starts with a minus, it&rsquo;s snowing and there&rsquo;s not a supercar in sight.</p>
<p>Back on business, this week I&rsquo;m talking about the challenge of loading breaches and managing costs. A breach load immediately takes us from a very high percentage cache hit ratio on Cloudflare to zero. Consequently, our SQL costs skyrocket as the DB scales to support the load. Approximately 28 hours after loading the two breaches I mention in this week&rsquo;s update, we&rsquo;re still running a DB scale that&rsquo;s 350% larger than once we have a high cache hit ratio, and that <em>directly</em> hits my wallet. We need to work on this more because as I say in the video, I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t like financial incentives that influence how breaches are handled, such as delaying them and bulking them together to reduce the impact of cache flush events like this. We&rsquo;ll give that more thought, I think there are a few ways to tackle this. For now, here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s video and some of the challenges we&rsquo;re facing:</p>

<p>I fell waaay behind the normal video cadence this week, and I couldn&rsquo;t care less ðŸ˜Š I mean c&rsquo;mon, would you rather be working or sitting here looking at this view after snowboarding through Christmas?!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That said, Scott and I did carve out some time to chat about the, uh, &ldquo;colourful&rdquo; feedback he&rsquo;s had after finally putting a price on some Report URI features he&rsquo;d been giving away free for years. And there&rsquo;s more data breaches, of course, including a couple I loaded over the previous week that I think were particularly interesting. Enjoy this week&rsquo;s video, next week&rsquo;s will be a 2024 wrap-up from somewhere much, much sunnier ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a certain irony to the Bluesky situation where people are pushing back when I include links to X. Now, where have we seen this sort of behaviour before? ðŸ¤” When I&rsquo;m relying on content that only appears on that platform to add context to a data breach in HIBP <em>and</em> that content is freely accessible from within the native Bluesky app (without needing an X account), we&rsquo;re out of reasonable excuses for the negativity. And if &ldquo;because Elon&rdquo; is the sole reason and someone is firm enough in their convictions on that, there&rsquo;s a very easy solution ðŸ™‚</p>

Armenia&rsquo;s National Computer Incident Response Team AM-CERT now joins three dozen other national counterparts in gaining visibility into how data breaches impact their national interests.</p>

<p>You know how banks really, really want to avoid their customers falling victim to phishing scams? And how they put a heap of effort into education to warn folks about the hallmarks of phishing scams? And how banks are the shining beacons of light when it comes to demonstrating security best practices? Ok, that final one might be a bit of a stretch, but the fact remains that people have high expectations of how banks should communicate to ensure that they themselves don&rsquo;t come across as phishers:</p>

		<p>It was a cold and wet Thursday morning, sometime in early 2006. There I was sitting at the very top back row of an awe-inspiring lecture theatre inside Royal Holloway&rsquo;s Founderâ€™s Building inÂ Egham, Surrey (UK)Â while studying for my MSc in Information Security. Back then, the lecture in progress was from the software security module.</p>
