		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Wave Hello to Privacy: Efficient Mixed-Mode MPC using Wavelet Transforms</strong><br>
<em>José Reis, Mehmet Ugurbil, Sameer Wagh, Ryan Henry, Miguel de Vega</em></p>
<p>This paper introduces new protocols for secure multiparty computation (MPC) leveraging Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWTs) for computing nonlinear functions over large domains. By employing DWTs, the protocols significantly reduce the overhead typically associated with Lookup Table-style (LUT) evaluations in MPC. We state and prove foundational results for DWT-compressed LUTs in MPC, present protocols for 9 of the most common activation functions used in ML, and experimentally evaluate the performance of our protocols for large domain sizes in the LAN and WAN settings. Our protocols are extremely fast &ndash; for instance, when considering 64-bit inputs, computing 1000 parallel instances of the sigmoid function, with an error less than $2^{-24}$ takes only a few hundred milliseconds incurs just 29,KiB of online communication (40 bytes per evaluation).</p>

<p>Apparently, Stefan and I trying to work stuff out in real time about how to build more efficient features in HIBP is entertaining watching! If I was to guess, I think it&rsquo;s just seeing people work through the logic of how things work and how we might be able to approach things differently, and doing it in real time very candidly. I&rsquo;m totally happy doing that, and the comments from the audience did give us more good food for thought too. I&rsquo;ll try and line up a session just like that before the end of the year, we&rsquo;ve certainly got no shortage of material!</p>

<p>Firstly, my apologies for the minute and a bit of echo at the start of this video, OBS had somehow magically decided to start recording both the primary mic and the one built into my camera. Easy fix, moving on&hellip;</p>
<p>During the livestream, I was perplexed as to why the HIBP DB was suddenly maxing out. Turns out that this aligned with <em>dropping</em> a constraint on the table of domains which appears to have caused the table to reindex and massively slow down the queries for breached email addresses. Further, we simultaneously started having problems related to MAXDOP (the maximum degree of parallelism for the stored procedure running the query), which was only resolved after we forced it to <em>not</em> run on multiple CPUs by setting it to 1 (weirdly, 2 is also fine but 3 or higher completely killed perf). Fun times, running a service like this.</p>

<p>I have really clear memories of listening to the Stack Overflow podcast in the late 2000&rsquo;s and hearing Jeff and Joel talk about the various challenges they were facing and the things they did to overcome them. I just suddenly thought of that when realising how long this week&rsquo;s video went for with no real plan other than to talk about our HIBP backlog. People seem to love this in the same way I loved listening to the guys a decade and a half ago. I&rsquo;ll do one of these with Stefan as well over the course of this month, let us know what you&rsquo;d like to hear about 😊</p>

<p>This was a much longer than usual update, largely due to the amount of time spent discussing the Earth 2 incident. As I said in the video (many times!), the amount of attention this has garnered from both Earth 2 users and the company itself is incommensurate with the impact of the incident itself. It&rsquo;s a nothing-burger. Email addresses and usernames, that&rsquo;s it, and of course, their association with the service, which may lead to some very targeted spam or phishing attempts. It&rsquo;s still a breach by any reasonable definition of the term, but it should have been succinctly summarised and disclosed to impacted parties with everyone moving on with more important things in life a few moments later. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do right now 😊</p>
