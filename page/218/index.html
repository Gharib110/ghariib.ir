		<p>Intel is the one to watch in the GPU scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an odd time to be an Intel fan. The company continues to struggle with its desktop CPUs but Lunar Lake mobile processors and Arc discrete graphics cards have been largely well received. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Intel&rsquo;s push into the affordable GPU market segment, offering gamers excellent value with Battlemage GPUs for less than $250. The latest addition to the family is the Intel Arc B570, a 1080p and 1440p GPU for $219, seriously undercutting some of the offerings from direct competitors. It&rsquo;s a great time to be a PC gamer as Intel looks to break up the GPU duopoly and here&rsquo;s why these cards will be a sleeper hit for desktop systems.</p>

		<p>Crafting a PC with a unique aesthetic might have become harder, but it&rsquo;s not impossible</p>
<p>Ask a PC builder whether they care about performance or looks, and they&rsquo;ll probably answer &ldquo;both.&rdquo; Building a PC that looks unique, however, is easier said than done. Since everyone usually builds with the same overused components, it&rsquo;s hard to craft a PC that stands out. You either end up creating the same fish tank PC as countless others, or an understated black or white-themed build with no RGB.</p>

		<p>x86 has seen setback after setback, and now Arm is looking to capitalize.</p>
<p>x86 has been the primary architecture of PCs and servers over the last few decades, and yet, we&rsquo;re starting to see a tangible shift towards something different. Arm is becoming more and more commonplace, with software vendors finally building their applications for Arm platforms on Windows with the release of the Snapdragon X Elite. Plus, Apple&rsquo;s own shift towards Arm means that an entire segment of mainstream and professional machines are no longer using x86, too.</p>

		<p>Access important notes from any device</p>
<p>I take notes on my smartphone, laptop, and tablet all the time. Whether it&rsquo;s new ideas for articles or a bug that I experience on a device I&rsquo;m testing, I make it a point to note them down since I tend to forget things quite easily. Apart from storing all my notes in one place for quick referencing, I need to be able to access my notes from all of my devices. Since a lot of users have similar requirements, app stores on all platforms are flooded with note-taking apps that cater to this exact use case. So, deciding which tool to use for taking notes and syncing them across your devices can be confusing.</p>

		<p>A new PC build might involve dozens of things to worry about, but these 6 are not some of them</p>
<p>Building a PC is often considered to be an &ldquo;adult LEGO&rdquo; activity, but it can sometimes be a tad intimidating, especially for a first-time builder. Even if you manage to get a great PC parts list from a friend, subreddit, or YouTuber, you still need to assemble everything without making mistakes that could cost hundreds of dollars or more to fix.</p>

		<p>These days, technology moves fast, and the old adage of &rsquo;leave it alone if it&rsquo;s working&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply to BIOS updates.</p>
<p>Whether you use a gaming PC with a powerful CPU inside or do most of your gaming on a PC gaming handheld, you&rsquo;ve heard that if your BIOS is working, leave it alone. For the longest time, that was sage advice because BIOS updates ran the risk of bricking the computer, but it&rsquo;s less of a concern with how UEFI BIOS are constructed, and truly bricked devices are rare.</p>
