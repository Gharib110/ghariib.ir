	<div>
		<p>When it comes to tech careers, web development and software development often get tossed around like they&rsquo;re the same thing. But they&rsquo;re not. Web development is like crafting the storefront of a shop, making it look good and work well for customers. Software development, on the other hand, is like building tools and applications that people use, whether on a computer, phone, or other devices. Both are super important in the tech world, but they require different skills and focus on different things. Let&rsquo;s dive into what sets them apart and what you need to know if you&rsquo;re thinking about a career in either field.</p>

		<p>The GPG key used to sign the Firefox release manifests is expiring soon, and so we’re going to be switching over to new key shortly.</p>
<p>The new GPG fingerprint is <code>14F2 6682 D091 6CDD 81E3 7B6D 61B7 B526 D98F 0353</code> and its subkey’s fingerprint is <code>ADD7 0794 7970 0DCA DFDD 5337 E36D 3B13 F3D9 3274</code>, and it expires <code>2025-05-04</code>.</p>
<p>The public key can be fetched from KEY files from the latest Firefox Nightly, keys.openpgp.org, or from below. This can be used to validate existing releases signed with the current key, or future releases signed with the new key.</p>

		<p>In accordance with the Mozilla Manifesto, which emphasizes the open development of policy that protects users’ privacy and security, we have worked with the Mozilla community over the past several months to improve the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) so that we can now announce version 2.8, effective June 1, 2022. These policy changes aim to improve the transparency of Certificate Authority (CA) operations and the certificates that they issue. A detailed comparison of the policy changes may be found here, and the significant policy changes that appear in this version are:</p>

		<p>The high-speed, low-latency data highway powering AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen CPUs</p>
<p>If you own an AMD Ryzen CPU and have done a Google search for information about RAM overclocking, speed, and stability in the last 7 years, chances are you might have come across something called the &ldquo;Infinity Fabric.&rdquo; Usually brought into discussions to explain the somewhat unique relationship of AMD CPUs with high-speed memory, Infinity Fabric is an internal interconnect bus that forms the core of AMD&rsquo;s scalable CPU architecture.</p>

	<div>
		<p>A cybercriminal campaign linked to Russia is deploying QR codes to access the WhatsApp accounts of high-profile targets like journalists, members of think tanks, and employees of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), according to new details revealed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The group, which Microsoft tracks by the name “Star Blizzard,” is also referred to as Coldriver by other researchers. Last year, the group created impersonation accounts where members posed as experts in a field that their targets might be interested in—or that was somehow affiliated with the target. Once a relationship had been established, the target would receive a phishing link or a document that contained a phishing link.</p>
