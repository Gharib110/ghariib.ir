Did you ever own (or covet) one of those e-ink Pebble smartwatches of yore? Well, good news if you did: Google today open-sourced the PebbleOS operating system it used (minus proprietary bits) having acquired Pebble’s assets when buying Fitbit in 2021 (and Fitbit bought Pebble in 2016, but more on that in a mo’.) More open source code in the world is good news, and it means anyone can reuse PebbleOS to build their own smartwatches, or learn from perusing the code how the former Pebble team tackled building a solid real-time OS on such limited hardware.

		<p>A financially motivated threat actor has been linked to a sophisticated cyber campaign that has been targeting users in Poland and Germany since July 2024. </p>
<p>The effort uses phishing emails to spread a range of malware payloads, including Agent Tesla, Snake Keylogger, and an undocumented backdoor called TorNet. </p>
<p>This backdoor leverages Windows Scheduled Tasks for persistence and employs advanced evasion techniques to bypass detection.</p>
<p>Cisco Talos researchers report that the attack begins with phishing emails masquerading as financial institutions or logistics companies. These emails, written predominantly in Polish and German, contain malicious attachments compressed in .tgz format. </p>
