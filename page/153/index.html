		<p>It’s 2025, and it’s time to modernize and (finally) adopt Linux. You don’t have time to retrofit the operating system that shipped with your laptop so it works with the decentralized and cloud-based network the world runs on. Red Hat developers are working harder than ever to make sure it’s easier than ever for you to get started with Linux. Here are the top 10 reasons to get Linux onto your computer and into your data center in 2025.1. Linux helps you with cloud adoptionThe cloud is all about distribution. One of the reasons the cloud is so powerful is because it lets software run in</p>

		<p>Going direct and getting genuine parts for your favorite consoles should be a thing.</p>
<p>Has the fan seized up inside your game console? How about the display or disc drive? Whenever something goes wrong with a specific part of any video game console, it can be a pain to get it rectified. The most common route is to reach out to the manufacturer, which will require you to either send out the device or seek local assistance from a nearby shop. This can prove time-consuming and costly, depending on whether your console is still under warranty. But what about a classic console? Why don&rsquo;t manufacturers stock and sell parts for all console models?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it run Doom&rdquo; is a classic trend where people try to put the classic FPS on as many devices as possible. However, what about the humble Tetris? Everyone knows the famous block-moving game, but people don&rsquo;t really try to get it running on as many weird and wonderful devices as they do Doom.</p>

		<p>Put your gaming and tinkering skills to the test with these fun Raspberry Pi projects</p>
<p>Over the years, the Raspberry Pi SBCs have brought numerous types of projects to life. For coders, you’ve got LAMP web servers, Flask websites, and portable Kali Linux workstations. Meanwhile, home lab enthusiasts can use these tiny boards to build a reliable Docker ecosystem that includes everything from the containers to management/orchestration platforms like Portainer and Kubernetes. Then there are the more practical projects like media servers, NAS, VPN machines, and Home Assistant hubs.</p>

		<p>Make your laptop even better with the right mix of peripherals.</p>
<p>Many of us rely on our laptops for work, school, or entertainment, but even the best laptops trade power and features for the convenience of portability. Gaming laptops come with power-limited GPUs, pretty much all laptops are limited in storage space, and the thinner they get, the harder they are to cool. But with a few wisely chosen pieces of external hardware, that laptop can turn into a powerhouse of productivity and graphical prowess.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Formal Treatment of Homomorphic Encryption Based Outsourced Computation in the Universal Composability Framework</strong><br>
<em>Wasilij Beskorovajnov, Sarai Eilebrecht, Yufan Jiang, Jörn Mueller-Quade</em></p>
<p>The adoption of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) applications in the real world remains lim- ited, even nearly 50 years after the introduction of HE. This is particu- larly unfortunate given the strong privacy and confidentiality guarantees these tools can offer to modern digital life. While attempting to incorporate a simple straw-man PSI protocol into a web service for matching individuals based on their profiles, we en- countered several shortcomings in current outsourcing frameworks. Ex- isting outsourced protocols either require clients to perform tasks beyond merely contributing their inputs or rely on a non-collusion assumption between a server and a client, which appears implausible in standard web service scenarios. To address these issues, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first general construction for non-interactive outsourced computation based on black-box homomorphic encryption. This approach relies on a non- collusion assumption between two dedicated servers, which we consider more realistic in a web-service setting. Furthermore, we provide a proof of our construction within the Universal Composability (UC) framework, assuming semi-honest (i.e., passive) adversaries. Unlike general one-sided two-party SFE protocols, our construction addi- tionally requires sender privacy. Specifically, the sender must contribute its inputs solely in encrypted form. This ensures stronger privacy guar- antees and broadens the applicability of the protocol. Overall, the range of applications for our construction includes all one- sided two-party sender-private SFE protocols as well as server-based arithmetic computations on encrypted inputs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our general outsourced computation frame- work by applying it to the specific use case of Outsourced Private Set Intersection (OPSI) in a real-world scenario, accompanied by a detailed evaluation of its efficiency.</p>
