		<p>Introducing agent mode for GitHub Copilot in VS Code, announcing the general availability of Copilot Edits, and providing a first look at our SWE agent.</p>
<p>The post GitHub Copilot: The agent awakens appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>When we introduced GitHub Copilot back in 2021, we had a clear goal: to make developers’ lives easier with an AI pair programmer that helps them write better code. The name reflects our belief that artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t replacing the developer. Instead, it’s always on their side. And like any good first officer, Copilot can also fly by itself: for example, when providing pull request feedback, autofixing security vulnerabilities, or brainstorming on how to implement an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Holograms for Next-Level Encryption</strong></p>
<p>As the demand for digital security grows, researchers have developed a new optical system that uses holograms to encode information, creating a level of encryption that traditional methods cannot penetrate. This advance could pave the way for more secure communication channels, helping to protect sensitive data.</p>

	<div>
		<p>AWS Network Firewall is a managed, stateful network firewall and intrusion protection service that you can use to implement firewall rules for fine grained control over your network traffic. With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your virtual private cloud (VPC); including filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. In this post, we show you how AWS Network Firewall uses session state replication to help maintain high availability for your application traffic.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Creating an enterprise security-first culture is one of the most impactful things a CISO can do to protect their organization. Sure, high-tech solutions and fancy tools are important, but they are largely ineffective when staff are unable or unwilling to play their part in preventing, identifying, and reporting security incidents. However, in the quest to develop a positive cybersecurity culture, many Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) inadvertently create a toxic environment. This is understandable: after all, when employees make a mistake that results in a security breach, it’s not&hellip;</p>
