	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Today, computers are more sophisticated, interconnected and complex than ever. This means they’re more capable than ever – but it also comes with a downside: that their attack surface is larger than ever, leading to an elevated risk of cyber incidents. Therefore, your approach to managing vulnerabilities needs to be holistic and prepare for all the ways in which vulnerabilities could cause damage to users, systems or your organization’s operations and reputation. In short, you need a vulnerability management plan. </p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As January approaches and the year comes to a close, distinct changes in global Internet usage emerge. Year-end traditions — ranging from Christmas feasts to New Year’s Eve (NYE) countdowns — shape online behavior across continents and cultures. Looking back at Christmas and NYE 2023 offers insights into how these trends may repeat this year, and by January 2025, we’ll be able to directly compare patterns. Examining data from 50 countries and regions reveals how people celebrated in 2023-2024, providing a timely reminder of typical holiday trends.</p>

		<p><strong>“You don’t want to think about security — until you have to.”</strong></p>
<p>That’s what I’d tell you if I were being honest about the state of development at most organizations I have spoken to. Every business out there is chasing one thing: speed. Move faster. Innovate faster. Ship faster. To them, speed is survival. There’s something these companies are not seeing — a shadow. An unseen risk hiding behind every shortcut, every unchecked tool, and every corner cut in the name of “progress.”</p>

		<p>Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions have long served as the indispensable nerve center for the security operations center (SOC). However, the SIEM landscape has undergone seismic shifts and market disruption in recent times, making it that much harder for chief information security officers (CISOs) to navigate and select the optimal SIEM for their needs.</p>

There’s a very extension analysis of WannaCry here where this information comes from WannaCry: Two Weeks and 16 Million Averted Ransoms Later. Yes, WannaCrypt can […]</p>
