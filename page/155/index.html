A new beta release of open source graphics editing app Pinta is available for testing. Pinta 3.0 (beta) gives fans of this cross-platform raster image editor, which is directly inspired by the iconic Paint.NET Windows app, an early opportunity to try out the changes it brings — and there’s a fair few! The most impactful change in Pinta 3.0 is the most obvious one: it’s revamped UI. Newly ported to GTK4 and libadwaita, Pinta 3.0 swaps a traditional window frame and text-based menu bar for a button-based header bar. Long-time users may might themselves taking a bit of time to […]</p>

<p>Remember Plank, the simplest dock on the planet? There’s now a free open-source fork to make it fully functional in recent Linux Distributions.</p>
<p>Plank is a 14 years old application that provides an iOS bottom bar style dock app launcher, that’s great for lightweight Linux Desktops. The goal is to provide just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more.</p>
<p>Plank seems not in active development, though it still works in recent Linux Distributions. However, it has compatibility issues and broken docklets/applets. For those who’re still using or prefer this dock, there’s now an open-source fork worth a try.</p>

	<div>
		<p>PowerSchool, a leading U.S.-based education technology provider, has begun notifying students, teachers, and other affected individuals following a massive data breach that occurred in December 2024.</p>
<p>The breach, which compromised sensitive personal information, is one of the largest cybersecurity incidents to impact the education sector in recent years.</p>
<p>The breach occurred when attackers gained unauthorized access to PowerSchool’s customer support portal using stolen credentials.</p>
<p>This allowed them to extract data from the company’s Student Information System (SIS), which is widely used across North America to manage student records, grades, and attendance.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Preprocessing Security in Multiple Idealized Models with Applications to Schnorr Signatures and PSEC-KEM</strong><br>
<em>Jeremiah Blocki, Seunghoon Lee</em></p>
<p>In modern cryptography, relatively few instantiations of foundational cryptographic primitives are used across most cryptographic protocols. For example, elliptic curve groups are typically instantiated using P-256, P-384, Curve25519, or Curve448, while block ciphers are commonly instantiated with AES, and hash functions with SHA-2, SHA-3, or SHAKE. This limited diversity raises concerns that an adversary with nation-state-level resources could perform a preprocessing attack, generating a hint that might later be exploited to break protocols built on these primitives. It is often notoriously challenging to analyze and upper bound the advantage of a preprocessing attacker even if we assume that we have idealized instantiations of our cryptographic primitives (ideal permutations, ideal ciphers, random oracles, generic groups). Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18) demonstrated a powerful framework to simplify the analysis of preprocessing attacks, but they only proved that their framework applies when the cryptographic protocol uses a single idealized primitive. In practice, however, cryptographic constructions often utilize multiple different cryptographic primitives.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>PRISM: Simple And Compact Identification and Signatures From Large Prime Degree Isogenies</strong><br>
<em>Andrea Basso, Giacomo Borin, Wouter Castryck, Maria Corte-Real Santos, Riccardo Invernizzi, Antonin Leroux, Luciano Maino, Frederik Vercauteren, Benjamin Wesolowski</em></p>
<p>The problem of computing an isogeny of large prime degree from a supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring is assumed to be hard both for classical as well as quantum computers. In this work, we first build a two-round identification protocol whose security reduces to this problem. The challenge consists of a random large prime $q$ and the prover simply replies with an efficient representation of an isogeny of degree $q$ from its public key. Using the hash-and-sign paradigm, we then derive a signature scheme with a very simple and flexible signing procedure and prove its security in the standard model. Our optimized C implementation of the signature scheme shows that signing is roughly $1.8times$ faster than all SQIsign variants, whereas verification is $1.4times$ times slower. The sizes of the public key and signature are comparable to existing schemes.</p>
