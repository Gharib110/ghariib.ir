<p>Click to Read Complete This blog with GitHub repository</p>
<p>Arrow functions are a popular feature in JavaScript introduced with ES6, simplifying the way functions are written. They come in two main syntaxes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Block Body</strong>: <code>( ) =&gt; { }</code></li>
<li><strong>Concise Body</strong>: <code>( ) =&gt; ( )</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding the difference between these two syntaxes is crucial as they differ in behavior, readability, and use cases. Let‚Äôs dive into the details.</p>

		<p>I never imagined a PC building contest would get me an RTX 3080 gaming PC</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had great luck with giveaways or sweepstakes, and frankly, I stopped participating in them years ago. On a fateful day in June 2022, however, I decided to enter an online PC building contest organized by WD and Nvidia. Like always, I didn&rsquo;t really believe I&rsquo;d win something, but a few weeks later, it became a reality. My tale is 2 years old, but better late than never as they say.</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t need a full NAS to get started sharing files on your home network.</p>
<p>We all need more and more storage space for our digital files, but you don&rsquo;t always have to dive straight in to a consumer NAS with expensive hard drives. You can take an old SSD or even a flash drive and turn it into a small network drive to get you on your self-storage journey. That&rsquo;s possible because the best Wi-Fi routers have a USB port on them which can be used as a host device for things like USB modems, but also for storage drives. It&rsquo;s also fairly straightforward to enable in your router settings, so let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>

		<p>The feature had been around for ages, too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been stumped on what a word means in a Microsoft Word document, Smart Lookup always has your back. The handy tool makes it really easy to look up definitions of a word and also powers the software&rsquo;s thesaurus feature to find more ways to express what you&rsquo;re saying. If you get a lot of use out of Smart Lookup, I&rsquo;m afraid to say that Microsoft is now getting rid of it, and you may not like what comes next.</p>

		<p>Reverse all the proxies with Nginx for your NAS-powered services.</p>
<p>Running services on your network-attached storage (NAS) device is one thing but it&rsquo;s a different beast to make these securely available to the outside world with SSL certificates, DDNS, and domain names. That&rsquo;s where handy tools such as Nginx, HAProxy, and Traefik come into play. I&rsquo;ve used HAProxy extensively but recently switched to Nginx for a few reasons. These front-end services will catch incoming traffic and route it accordingly, depending on the configuration, what services you&rsquo;re hosting, and conditions set. Here&rsquo;s why you should consider Nginx when looking at reverse proxies.</p>

		<p>Breaking bad habits takes effort, but it‚Äôs a necessary step toward improving your Photoshop skills</p>
<p>Photoshop offers endless creative control over your projects, but even experienced users develop bad habits. As a 25-year veteran of Photoshop, I still occasionally catch myself falling back on old habits that I picked up early in my career. Many of these mistakes stem from early learning stages, especially for those who are self-taught users or don‚Äôt use Photoshop day-to-day.</p>
