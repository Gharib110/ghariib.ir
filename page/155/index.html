		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On Multi-Key FuncCPA Secure Encryption Schemes</strong><br>
<em>Eri Nakajima, Keisuke Hara, Kyosuke Yamashita</em></p>
<p>The notion of funcCPA security for homomorphic encryption schemes was introduced by Akavia textit{et<del>al.} (TCC 2022). Whereas it aims to capture the bootstrapping technique in homomorphic encryption schemes, Dodis textit{et</del>al.} (TCC 2023) pointed out that funcCPA security can also be applied to non-homomorphic public-key encryption schemes (PKE). As an example, they presented a use case for privacy-preserving outsourced computation without homomorphic computation. It should be noted that prior work on funcCPA security, including the use case presented by Dodis textit{et~al.}, considered only the single-key setting. However, in recent years, multi-party collaboration in outsourced computation has garnered significant attention, making it desirable for funcCPA security to support the multi-key setting. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a new notion of security called Multi-Key funcCPA (MKfunc) to address this need, and show that if a PKE scheme is KDM-secure, then it is also MKfuncCPA secure. Furthermore, we show that similar discussions can be applied to symmetric-key encryption.</p>

<p>P2P networks are more scalable and robust than traditional C/S structures, and these advantages were recognized by the botnet authors early on and used in their botnets. In terms of time, Storm, which appeared in 2007, can be considered the progenitor of this area, when botnet threats were first known to the public. after Storm, there have been Karen, ZeroAccess, GameOver, Hijime, mozi and other kinds of P2P botnes, P2P botnets come and go, and some, for example, Mozi keep on going even though the author had been caught.</p>

		<p>Unless you have been gifted with a photographic memory, this is likely going to sound very familiar. Picture it: You’re away from your desk and you need to access one of your apps from your phone. You attempt to sign in and get the dreaded message: “the username and password entered do not match our records.” Thus begins the time-consuming process of requesting a password reset, including coming up with a new password that doesn’t match something you’ve already used in the past. Despite the frustration you feel, passwords have been the cornerstone of keeping our online data secure fo</p>
