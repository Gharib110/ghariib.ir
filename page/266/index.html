<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 14, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Despite the growing sophistication of cyberattacks, human error remains one of the most common vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Phishing scams, malware attacks, and social engineering tactics often target employees unaware of basic cyber security practices. This lack of awareness can result in breaches that cost companies millions.</p>

<p>Measuring success in human risk management is notoriously tricky. Unlike other areas of cybersecurity, where success is defined by stopping breaches or identifying vulnerabilities, metrics for Human Risk Programs often feels intangible. The absence of &ldquo;bad things happening&rdquo; doesn’t always translate into clear, quantifiable success. Here’s why many programs struggle to show measurable impact—and what can be done about it.</p>

		<p>In today’s cyber threat landscape, good enough is no longer good enough. Cyberattacks don’t clock out at 5 PM, and neither can your security strategy. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), offering customers 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response isn’t just a competitive advantage—it’s an essential service for business continuity, customer trust, and staying ahead of attackers.</p>
<p>But delivering round-the-clock security coverage is easier said than done. It requires the right tools, expertise, and scale. This is why partnering with OpenText for offering managed detection and response (MDR) can help MSPs deliver on this critical need without overburdening their resources.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This post discusses CVE-2024-38193, a use-after-free vulnerability in the afd.sys Windows driver. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the Registered I/O extension for Windows sockets. The vulnerability was patched in the August 2024 Patch Tuesday. This post describes the exploitation process for the vulnerability.</p>
<p>First, we give a general overview of the registered I/O extension for Winsock, describing the driver’s internal structures. We then analyze the vulnerability and proceed to detailing the exploitation strategy.</p>

<p>It’s time to stop proclaiming that “cloud native is the future”. Kubernetes has just celebrated its 10 year anniversary, and 76% of respondents to the latest CNCF Annual Survey reported that they have adopted cloud native technologies, like containers, for much or all of their production development and deployment. Cloud native isn’t the future – it’s here and now.</p>
<p>Data-intensive workloads are no exception. On the contrary, The Voice of Kubernetes Experts Report 2024 found that 97% of organizations are running data workloads on cloud native platforms, with 72% of databases and 67% of analytics services being run on Kubernetes. </p>

<p>Backscatter is a tool developed by the Mandiant FLARE team that aims to automatically extract malware configurations. It relies on static signatures and emulation to extract this information without dynamic execution, bypassing anti-analysis logic present in many modern families. This complements dynamic analysis, providing faster threat identification and high-confidence malware family attribution. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-operations">Google SecOps</a> reverse engineers ensure precise indicators of compromise (IOC) extraction, empowering security teams with actionable threat intelligence to proactively neutralize attacks.</p>

		<p><em>This ongoing</em> <em>Docker Labs GenAI series</em> <em>explores the exciting space of AI developer tools. At Docker, we believe there is a vast scope to explore, openly and without the hype. We will share our explorations and collaborate with the developer community in real time. Although developers have adopted autocomplete tooling like GitHub Copilot and use chat, there is significant potential for AI tools to assist with more specific tasks and interfaces throughout the entire software lifecycle. Therefore, our exploration will be broad. We will be releasing software as open source so you can play, explore, and hack with us, too.</em></p>
