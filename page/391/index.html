		<p>These are some of the best PC games history has to offer.</p>
<p>Struggling to find a PC game to play? It&rsquo;s no secret that games released today don&rsquo;t have as much magic as those from the 1990s and early 2000s. There are some excellent games from talented studios, but many fall short of what came before. So sit back, grab a beverage, and make some notes as I&rsquo;m going to run through a shortlist of classic PC games you can still play today on a desktop or laptop PC running Windows 11.

		<p>Get the thock you always wanted with these simple mods.</p>
<p>I absolutely love my mechanical keyboard. For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been using a Keychron K2 V2 with minor upgrades every now and then. Trust me when I say this &ndash; once you switch to a mechanical keyboard &ndash; there&rsquo;s no going back. There are a plethora of mechanical keyboards out there in the market that you can buy, or you could even build your own mechanical keyboard with custom parts. Regardless of which option you choose, the world of mechanical keyboards is a rabbit hole that keeps going deeper and deeper. What I mean to say is, that you can keep upgrading or modding your keyboard with time to make it even better.</p>

Before you dismiss it as a thing of the past, check out these reasons why Firefox might just be the browser you need in 2025.</p>
