	<div>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t be quick to splurge on the RTX 5090</p>
<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 5090 is the most powerful consumer graphics card you can buy in 2025. One of the main reasons it costs $2,000 is that it has no competition from AMD and Intel. However, even if you can afford to spend that much money on this flagship graphics card, you have to be very careful because there are some important factors to consider before you put it inside your case. Otherwise, you may have to spend even more on additional components to enjoy all the performance gains it brings to the table.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As organizations increasingly adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and manage their cloud environments, ensuring the security of these configurations has become a critical priority.</p>
<p>IaC allows teams to define infrastructure using code, enabling rapid deployment and scalability, but it also introduces risks such as misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can expose systems to attacks.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, specialized tools have emerged to scan IaC templates for vulnerabilities, enforce compliance with security standards, and ensure robust cloud infrastructure.</p>

		<p>The future of the creative industries isn&rsquo;t locked behind subscription paywalls</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons you might choose to use open-source tools, whether it’s to avoid the Adobe corporation and find the best open-source alternatives to Adobe tools, or because you want to be in control of your privacy and security. The future of creative tools and software lies in open-source options for many reasons. Open-source tools will never diminish your creativity or limit your results.</p>

	<div>
		<p>For calibrating your 3D printer, Benchy isn&rsquo;t the only game in town. Here are other 3D test models you can use to dial in your 3D printer.</p>
<p>Benchy is a fantastic tool for testing 3D printer settings and identifying potential issues. Each model tests different printer functions, such as retraction settings, bridging, and overhang angles. Examining these diverse prints allows you to understand how your machine works in various situations.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Query preprocessing is a crucial step in customer-centric applications, ensuring accurate routing and action decisions. Instead of training separate models, I useSetFit with a multi-head classifier— a single shared embedding space with independent classification heads.</p>
<p>Each head specialises in one task, allowing task-specific learning while maintaining efficiency through shared representations. Positive and negative pairs are created using (intent, domain, hitl(human in the loop)) tuples for contrastive learning, ensuring the model effectively distinguishes related queries. This structured approach balances efficiency and flexibility, making it ideal for real-time applications where query classification must be both accurate and scalable. This is just an example. You may modify it as per your needs.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Breaking the Blindfold: Deep Learning-based Blind Side-channel Analysis</strong><br>
<em>Azade Rezaeezade, Trevor Yap, Dirmanto Jap, Shivam Bhasin, Stjepan Picek</em></p>
<p>Physical side-channel analysis (SCA) operates on the foundational assumption of access to known plaintext or ciphertext. However, this assumption can be easily invalidated in various scenarios, ranging from common encryption modes like Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) to complex hardware implementations, where such data may be inaccessible. Blind SCA addresses this challenge by operating without the knowledge of plaintext or ciphertext. Unfortunately, prior such approaches have shown limited success in practical settings.</p>
