		<h2 id="zero-trust-security-model-definition"><strong>Zero Trust Security Model Definition</strong></h2>
<p>With the adoption of cloud computing, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT), the traditional network perimeter no longer exists. This has created challenges for security professionals, requiring a new approach to cybersecurity. Zero Trust has emerged as a transformative security model. Let’s take a closer look into what Zero Trust is, how it works, and the benefits it offers to modern enterprises.</p>
<h2 id="zero-trust-explained"><strong>Zero Trust Explained</strong></h2>
<p>Gone are the days when organizations could secure their assets with firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) alone. Workloads now live in the cloud, users and devices are increasingly mobile, and data flows across diverse locations and applications. This shift has widened visibility gaps and exposed vulnerabilities in legacy security approaches.</p>

<p>DevOps is an evolving field that combines <strong>development</strong> and <strong>operations</strong> into one streamlined process, helping organizations improve collaboration, automation, and delivery of software. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced practitioner, learning DevOps can significantly improve your workflow, especially if you’re focused on <strong>continuous integration (CI)</strong>, <strong>continuous deployment (CD)</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure automation</strong>. <strong>DevOps tutorials</strong> are an excellent way to learn new skills, understand the tools and practices used in the field, and apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.</p>

	<div>
		<p>WhatsApp has accused the professional spyware company Paragon of spying on a select group of users.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, the Meta-owned, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform, said it has reliable information that nearly 100 journalists and other “members of civil society” were targets of a spyware campaign conducted by the Israeli spyware company.</p>
<p>“Members of civil society” usually refers to individuals and organizations that operate independently from government and business sectors, often those advocating for public interests, influencing policy, or holding governments accountable.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>I have been using VMware Core products for the last fifteen years—nine of those years as a VMware Administrator. I went from building basic virtual machines (VMs) to being a VMware Administrator, starting with vSphere/ESXi then handling the other VMware Core products vRealize Operations (Aria Ops), Aria Logs, Site Recovery Manager, and Network and Security (NSX). </p>
<p>Last year, I discovered Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. When I was first introduced to the product, I realized there were many options that would allow me to customize it to my specific environment. OpenShift Virtualization also offered more free rein than VMware. This article explores OpenShift Virtualization as an alternative to VMware.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Wiretapping LLMs: Network Side-Channel Attacks on Interactive LLM Services</strong><br>
<em>Mahdi Soleimani, Grace Jia, In Gim, Seung-seob Lee, Anurag Khandelwal</em></p>
<p>Recent server-side optimizations like speculative decoding significantly enhance the interactivity and resource efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) services. However, we show that these optimizations inadvertently introduce new side-channel vulnerabilities through network packet timing and size variations that tend to be input-dependent. Network adversaries can leverage these side channels to learn sensitive information contained in emph{encrypted} user prompts to and responses from public LLM services.</p>
