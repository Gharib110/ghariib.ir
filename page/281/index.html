<p>We recently shared an article about maximizing disk imaging speeds, which sparked a lot of feedback from our users and, surprisingly, from the developers of one of the disk imaging tools who quickly released an update addressing the issues we discovered in the initial test round. We did an additional test, and we’re ready to share further insights into the performance of disk imaging.</p>
<h2 id="test-environment-and-measuring-methodology">Test Environment and Measuring Methodology</h2>
<p>The hardware setup for the new tests remained largely unchanged from the previous test. We used the same ASUS Vivobook S16 S5606MA laptop (Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 32GB RAM, Thunderbolt 4). However, this time, the storage device used was a powerful Samsung 860 PRO (512GB), which is miles ahead of the previously used test drive. Over 100GB of compressed data (a bunch of zip archives) was written to the drive for testing.</p>

<h2 id="the-unhealthy-obsession-with-measuring-developer-productivity">The unhealthy obsession with measuring developer productivity</h2>
<p>There’s an unhealthy obsession with companies looking for a way to measure developer productivity.</p>
<p>The desire to measure productivity is understandable; senior leaders have been under pressure to deliver results while capitalizing on their investments in teams and technology. There are no sinister intentions behind measuring developer productivity; leaders genuinely want their teams to be as productive as possible. The problem is that developer productivity is incredibly difficult to measure, resulting in organizations allocating disproportionate effort and resources while trying to find the magic measure.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 14, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Despite the growing sophistication of cyberattacks, human error remains one of the most common vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Phishing scams, malware attacks, and social engineering tactics often target employees unaware of basic cyber security practices. This lack of awareness can result in breaches that cost companies millions.</p>

<p>Measuring success in human risk management is notoriously tricky. Unlike other areas of cybersecurity, where success is defined by stopping breaches or identifying vulnerabilities, metrics for Human Risk Programs often feels intangible. The absence of &ldquo;bad things happening&rdquo; doesn’t always translate into clear, quantifiable success. Here’s why many programs struggle to show measurable impact—and what can be done about it.</p>

		<p>In today’s cyber threat landscape, good enough is no longer good enough. Cyberattacks don’t clock out at 5 PM, and neither can your security strategy. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), offering customers 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response isn’t just a competitive advantage—it’s an essential service for business continuity, customer trust, and staying ahead of attackers.</p>
<p>But delivering round-the-clock security coverage is easier said than done. It requires the right tools, expertise, and scale. This is why partnering with OpenText for offering managed detection and response (MDR) can help MSPs deliver on this critical need without overburdening their resources.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This post discusses CVE-2024-38193, a use-after-free vulnerability in the afd.sys Windows driver. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the Registered I/O extension for Windows sockets. The vulnerability was patched in the August 2024 Patch Tuesday. This post describes the exploitation process for the vulnerability.</p>
<p>First, we give a general overview of the registered I/O extension for Winsock, describing the driver’s internal structures. We then analyze the vulnerability and proceed to detailing the exploitation strategy.</p>

<p>It’s time to stop proclaiming that “cloud native is the future”. Kubernetes has just celebrated its 10 year anniversary, and 76% of respondents to the latest CNCF Annual Survey reported that they have adopted cloud native technologies, like containers, for much or all of their production development and deployment. Cloud native isn’t the future – it’s here and now.</p>
<p>Data-intensive workloads are no exception. On the contrary, The Voice of Kubernetes Experts Report 2024 found that 97% of organizations are running data workloads on cloud native platforms, with 72% of databases and 67% of analytics services being run on Kubernetes. </p>

<p>Backscatter is a tool developed by the Mandiant FLARE team that aims to automatically extract malware configurations. It relies on static signatures and emulation to extract this information without dynamic execution, bypassing anti-analysis logic present in many modern families. This complements dynamic analysis, providing faster threat identification and high-confidence malware family attribution. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-operations">Google SecOps</a> reverse engineers ensure precise indicators of compromise (IOC) extraction, empowering security teams with actionable threat intelligence to proactively neutralize attacks.</p>
