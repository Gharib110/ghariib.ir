	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Elon Musk’s and Vivek Ramaswamy’s support for increasing high-skilled immigration visas has stirred up a political storm within conservative circles. Although Trump has supported Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s comments, his words conflict with his first-term immigration policies. If his change in rhetoric is matched by a change in policy, it would help make America great.</p>
<p>Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with improving government efficiency, both recently suggested that increasing the number of high-skill H-1B visas would improve the U.S. economy. Musk wrote on X that more H-1B visas are needed because “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.”</p>

	<div>
		<p>We are happy to announce that Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is now available in Microsoft’s new tar-based distribution architecture. </p>
<p>Ubuntu has been a widely used Linux distribution on WSL, offering a familiar development environment for many users. This new distribution architecture for WSL will make adoption easier in enterprise environments by enabling image customization and deployments at scale. The new tar-based WSL distro format allows developers and system administrators to distribute, install, and manage Ubuntu WSL instances from tar files without relying on the Microsoft Store.</p>

		<p>There is a constant “cat and mouse” game between defenders and attackers, the latter trying to outsmart and get a head start on the former. In the context of online advertising, this involves creating fake identities or using stolen ones to push out malicious ads.</p>
<p>An attacker not only needs to evade detection but also create a lure that will be convincing to most people. In this blog post, we focus on what malvertisers use in almost all of their campaigns, namely decoys also known as “white pages” in order to fool the advertising entity.</p>
