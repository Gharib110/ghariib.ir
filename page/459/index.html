		<p>Maintaining secure and efficient network access is crucial for distributed companies. The challenge lies in balancing convenience with security, often leading organizations to seek innovative solutions. Enter Tailscale, a modern VPN solution that provides a seamless way to connect distributed teams while enhancing security and simplifying network management.</p>

<p>Tailscale operates on a concept known as a mesh VPN, where devices communicate directly instead of routing traffic through a central server. This structure not only increases speed and reliability but also simplifies network configuration for remote teams. By leveraging Tailscale, businesses can build a private network accessible from anywhere in the world, effectively streamlining their digital workspace.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hi there! I&rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.</p>
<p>Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators.</p>

		<p>According to information from our intelligence network, ICA is working on a secret project. We need to find out what the project is. Once you have the access information, send them to us. We will place a backdoor to access the system later. You just focus on what the project is. You will probably have to go through several layers of security. The Agency has full confidence that you will successfully complete this mission. Good Luck, Agent!</p>
