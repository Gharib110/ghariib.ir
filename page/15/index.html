<p><strong>Holograms for Next-Level Encryption</strong></p>
<p>As the demand for digital security grows, researchers have developed a new optical system that uses holograms to encode information, creating a level of encryption that traditional methods cannot penetrate. This advance could pave the way for more secure communication channels, helping to protect sensitive data.</p>

		<p>AWS Network Firewall is a managed, stateful network firewall and intrusion protection service that you can use to implement firewall rules for fine grained control over your network traffic. With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your virtual private cloud (VPC); including filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. In this post, we show you how AWS Network Firewall uses session state replication to help maintain high availability for your application traffic.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Creating an enterprise security-first culture is one of the most impactful things a CISO can do to protect their organization. Sure, high-tech solutions and fancy tools are important, but they are largely ineffective when staff are unable or unwilling to play their part in preventing, identifying, and reporting security incidents. However, in the quest to develop a positive cybersecurity culture, many Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) inadvertently create a toxic environment. This is understandable: after all, when employees make a mistake that results in a security breach, it’s not&hellip;</p>

<p>Like the lead paint and asbestos of decades past, microplastics are the new awful contaminant that we really ought to do something about. They’re particularly abundant in the aquatic environment, and that’s not a good thing. While we’ve all seen heartbreaking photos of beaches strewn with water bottles and fishing nets, it’s the invisible threat that keeps environmentalists up at night. We’re talking about microplastics – those tiny fragments that are quietly infiltrating every corner of our oceans.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-mig-maximizes-gpu-efficiency-on-openshift-ai/">How MIG maximizes GPU efficiency on OpenShift AI</a></h1>
	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Modern data science workloads demand high computational power, and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) are often at the heart of these operations. However, sharing GPU resources efficiently among multiple users or workloads can be challenging. NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology offers a solution. This article explores how I tested MIG on Red Hat OpenShift AI using an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU and the benefits for AI and data science teams.</p>
<h2 id="the-nvidia-mig-solution-and-test">The NVIDIA MIG solution and test</h2>
<p>GPUs in a Kubernetes environment are assigned to pods in a 1:1 ratio by default. This means a single GPU is dedicated to one pod, regardless of whether the workload fully utilizes the GPU’s capacity. This limitation can lead to inefficient resource usage, especially for smaller workloads. NVIDIA MIG solves this issue by splitting a single GPU into multiple independent instances to be used by different pods. This feature maximizes GPU utilization and ensures resources are not wasted. In the next sections, I will demonstrate how I tested MIG on Red Hat OpenShift AI.</p>

		<p>It’s been a tough year for the healthcare sector. Throughout 2024, cybercriminals have unleashed a barrage of attacks on a vast number of healthcare organizations - with disconcerting levels of success. FBI research revealed that healthcare is now the US’s most targeted industry. The attack on Change Healthcare, a United Health-owned health tech company, for example, disrupted operations at thousands of hospitals, pharmacies, and physician practices, led to the theft of up to 6TB of sensitive health data, and is thought to have affected around 100 million people. Although HIPAA regulates&hellip;</p>
