		<p><em>I’m supposed to be finishing a wonky series on proof systems (here and here) and I promise I will do that this week. In the midst of this I’ve been a bit distracted by world events.</em></p>
<p>Last week the Washington Post published a bombshell story announcing that the U.K. had filed “technical capability notices” demanding that Apple modify the encryption used in their Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system for iCloud. For those who don’t know about ADP, it’s a system that enables full “end-to-end” encryption for iCloud backups, including photos and other data. This means that your backup data should be encrypted under your phone’s passcode — and critically, neither Apple nor hackers can access it. The U.K. request would secretly weaken that feature for at least some users.</p>

		<p>Virtualization lets organizations run multiple isolated workloads from the same hardware platform, saving money, and enabling more efficient scaling. It is also used by cloud providers to deliver on-demand computing resources for multiple customers using shared hardware. It’s what allows businesses to pay for only the cloud computing resources they need and quickly (or even &hellip;</p>

		<p>Apple&rsquo;s latest bevy of hardware releases feature processor upgrades and some processor naming confusion. The new iPhone 16e is Apple&rsquo;s least expensive iPhone, and it just may be all the phone you need. And why do the new iPads not support Apple&rsquo;s most advertised feature?</p>

<p>In business, the path to value creation requires more than strategic planning and execution—it demands an ability to connect the dots, anticipate needs, and understand the human elements that drive progress. Women often demonstrate these capabilities through their natural inclination to consider multiple perspectives and implications before making decisions. This approach, which emphasizes understanding the complete picture rather than just individual components, can lead to more sustainable and meaningful business outcomes. In honor of International Women’s Day, this blog post invites readers to take a closer look at how women move mountains in the corporate and technology landscapes, encouraging innovation […]</p>

	<b><time>07.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Just before the year starts to wrap up, we are getting the final 2024 release out! This contains a wide range of updates and changes, which are in already in effect, ready for immediate download, or updating.</p>
<p>The summary of the changelog since the 2024.3 release from September is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python 3.12</strong> - New default Python version <em>(Au revoir <code>pip</code>, hello pipx)</em></li>
<li><strong>The End Of The i386 Kernel and Images</strong> - Farewell x86 <em>(images)</em>, but not goodbye <em>(packages)</em></li>
<li><strong>Deprecations in the SSH Client: DSA keys</strong> - Reminder about using <code>ssh1</code> if required</li>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi Imager Customizations Support</strong> - Able to alter settings at write time</li>
<li><strong>GNOME 47</strong> - Now able to synchronize your favorite colors</li>
<li><strong>Kali Forums Refresh</strong> - New heart of the community home</li>
<li><strong>Kali NetHunter</strong> - Updates to the app, kernels, installer, store and website!</li>
<li><strong>New Tools</strong> - 14 new shiny toys added <em>(and countless updated!)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-new-python-version-312">A New Python Version: 3.12</h2>
<p><strong>Python 3.12 is now the default Python interpreter</strong>. While it was released upstream a year ago , it took a bit of time to become the default in Debian , and then even more time to make it to Kali Linux , but finally it’s here. Every new version of Python brings along some deprecations or subtle changes of behavior, which in turn breaks some Python packages, and we have to investigate and fix all the issues reported by our QA system. Hence the delay.</p>
