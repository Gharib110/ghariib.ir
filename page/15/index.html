<p>Typos. Too-good-to-be-true offers. Urgent warnings.</p>
<p>Scammers are getting smarter—and more convincing. New research from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reveals that Americans lost a staggering <strong>$12.5 billion to fraud in 2024</strong>, a <strong>25% increase from the previous year</strong>. The median reported loss was <strong>$497</strong>, with imposter scams alone accounting for nearly <strong>$3 billion in losses</strong>.</p>
<p>Fraud isn’t just increasing—it’s hitting certain areas harder than others. <strong>Florida, Georgia, and Delaware</strong> ranked as the top three states with the highest per-capita fraud reports, while <strong>California led in total reports with over 500,000 cases</strong>.</p>

		<p>We’re excited to announce that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has completed the annual Dubai Electronic Security Centre (DESC) certification audit to operate as a Tier 1 Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for the AWS Middle East (UAE) Region.</p>
<p>This alignment with DESC requirements demonstrates our continued commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for CSPs. Government customers of AWS can run their applications in AWS Cloud-certified Regions with confidence.</p>
<p>The independent third-party auditor (BSI) issued the Certificate of Compliance to AWS on behalf of DESC on January 23, 2025. The Certificate of Compliance that illustrates the compliance status of AWS is available through AWS Artifact. AWS Artifact is a self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. Sign in to AWS Artifact in the AWS Management Console, or learn more at Getting Started with AWS Artifact.</p>

		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce the publication of our annual compliance assessment report on the Information Assurance Regulation (IAR) established by the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The report covers the AWS Middle East (UAE) Region.</p>
<p>The IAR provides management and technical information security controls to help establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance. AWS alignment with IAR requirements demonstrates our ongoing commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for cloud service providers. As such, IAR-regulated customers can continue to use AWS services with confidence.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is pleased to launch key-level filtering for AWS KMS API usage in Amazon CloudWatch metrics, providing enhanced visibility to help customers improve their operational efficiency and aid in security and compliance risk management.</p>
<p>AWS KMS currently publishes account-level AWS KMS API usage metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, enabling you to monitor and manage your API usage. However, if you’re using numerous KMS keys, pinpointing the ones with the highest request rate quota usage or significant API costs becomes challenging. For example, if you have more than 10 active KMS keys in your account, prior to this launch you would have needed to build a custom CloudTrail and Amazon Athena based solution to locate which specific keys are driving the majority of API usage and costs. With the new CloudWatch metrics, which are available under the <code>AWS/KMS</code> namespace in CloudWatch, you can track, understand, and set alerts on detailed API usage at the individual KMS key level without building a costly customized solution.</p>

		<p>By Marc Ilunga Key derivation is essential in many cryptographic applications, including key exchange, key management, secure communications, and building robust cryptographic primitives. But it’s also easy to get wrong: although standard tools exist for different key derivation needs, our audits often uncover improper uses of these tools that could compromise key security.

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries like healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and even autonomous vehicles—making our daily lives hyperconnected. But as more devices come online, relying solely on cloud computing can lead to slow response times, high bandwidth costs and security risks. The traditional cloud-based infrastructure struggles to keep up with the demands of real-time data processing, low latency, and proactive, preventative security. Before we dive in, let me explain what is edge computing is about and how it applies to IoT. Simply put, edge computing processes data right where it’s generated instead of routing it to remote […]</p>
