		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Access Point that could allow for remote code execution. Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Access Point is Ciscoâ€™s solution to address wireless and mobile use case issues facing enterprises. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to replace any file on the underlying file system. The attacker could then perform any of the following actions: add users with root privileges, modify the device configuration, execute arbitrary code, or cause a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.</p>

		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in multiple Cleo products that could allow for remote code execution. Cleoâ€™s LexiCom, VLTransfer, and Harmony is software that is commonly used to manage file transfers. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Containerized application development has revolutionized modern software delivery, but slow image builds in CI/CD pipelines can bring developer productivity to a halt. Even with AWS CodeBuild automating application testing and building, teams face challenges like resource constraints, inefficient caching, and complex multi-architecture builds that lead to delays, lower release frequency, and prolonged recovery times.</p>
<p>Enter Docker Build Cloud, a high-performance cloud service designed to streamline image builds, integrate seamlessly with AWS CodeBuild, and reduce build times dramatically. With Docker Build Cloud, you gain powerful cloud-based builders, shared caching, and native multi-architecture support â€” all while keeping your CI/CD pipelines efficient and your developers focused on delivering value faster.</p>

		<p><strong>Traditional security approaches donâ€™t work for AI.</strong> Generative AI technology is already transforming our world and has immense positive potential for cybersecurity and business processes, but traditional security models and controls arenâ€™t enough to manage the security risks associated with this new technology.â€¯Â Â </p>
<p>We recently published a new whitepaper that examines the security challenges and opportunities from generative AI, what security must do to adapt to manage risk related to it, how a Zero Trust approach is essential to effectively secure this AI technology (and underlying data), and how different roles across your organization must work together for effective AI security.Â Â </p>

		<p>Being a 100% remote company for eight years and counting now, weâ€™ve managed to pick up employees across the world. Situated in North America, South America, all across Europe, and even as far as South Korea! (Hey, Antonia ðŸ‘‹)</p>
<p>Not to be confused with our yearly onsites where the whole company gets together (previous locations including our own private island in Croatia, an eco-retreat in the mountains surrounding Barcelona, and most recently, a whole village in the South of France), the Giant Mansion focuses on our different teams getting together to focus on big rocks that they want to tackle and spend some time working face to face. Weâ€™re strong advocates of 100% remote work, but sometimes we like to hang out with each other too. So in total, twice a year, our employees get together, both in their teams and then together as the whole company.</p>

		<p>This is a pretty sad case, and one which Iâ€™m sure all of us have followed since it first started. Surprisingly it hasnâ€™t gotten a whole lot of media attention, but then this legal precedent sticks it to the man and has some consequences regarding the infosec industry â€“ and who would want to publicize [â€¦]</p>

		<p>There seems to be a trend towards malware on the Android platform that extorts money from the user somehow, either through premium SMS or services â€“ or the latest trojan â€“ which covertly purchases apps from the mobile market. We first wrote about Android Antivirus software from Symantec back in 2010 and it seems like [â€¦]</p>

		<p>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.</p>
<p>This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committeeâ€™s role in their charter.</p>
