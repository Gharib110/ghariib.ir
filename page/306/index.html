		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Parametrizing Maximal Orders Along Supersingular $ell$-Isogeny Paths</strong><br>
<em>Laia Amorós, James Clements, Chloe Martindale</em></p>
<p>Suppose you have a supersingular $ell$-isogeny graph with vertices given by $j$-invariants defined over $mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, where $p = 4 cdot f cdot ell^e - 1$ and $ell equiv 3 pmod{4}$. We give an explicit parametrization of the maximal orders in $B_{p,infty}$ appearing as endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves in this graph that are $leq e$ steps away from a root vertex with $j$-invariant 1728. This is the first explicit parametrization of this kind and we believe it will be an aid in better understanding the structure of supersingular $ell$-isogeny graphs that are widely used in cryptography. Our method makes use of the inherent directions in the supersingular isogeny graph induced via Bruhat-Tits trees, as studied in [1]. We also discuss how in future work other interesting use cases, such as $ell=2$, could benefit from the same methodology.</p>

		<p>Job Posting: <strong>PhD in Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>King&rsquo;s College London</em></p>
<p>We are inviting applications for a PhD studentship in the cryptography lab at King&rsquo;s College London. Specifically, we are looking for an applicant to work with Martin Albrecht and Benjamin Dowling.</p>
<p>The PhD could, for example, cover cryptanalysing existing cryptographic technologies/protocols, such as Telegram or WhatsApp, or modelling and designing new cryptographic protocols or primitives.</p>
<p>This PhD will work in a team consisting of social scientists, specifically ethnographers, and us cryptographers. Together, we study what the security needs and wants of participants in large-scale protests are and how these relate to the security guarantees provided by cryptographic solutions.</p>

Raspberry Pi has today announced the launch of a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB RAM. A engorged-memory model had been oft-rumoured since the launch of the raspberry Pi 5 in 2024 – and long-desired by fans of this particular single-board computer (SBC). The launch of the new Raspberry Pi CM5 late last year offers up to 16GB RAM whilst utilising the same underlying chipset as the Pi 5, all but confirming a bumper RAM revision for the full-size board was imminent. Why didn’t they launch a 16GB model right away? It’s only with last year’s minor revision to the Broadcom […]</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Detection engineering is becoming increasingly important in surfacing new malicious activity. Threat actors might take advantage of previously unknown malware families - but a successful detection of certain methodologies or artifacts can help expose the entire infection chain.</p>
<p>In previous blog posts, we announced the integration of Sigma rules for macOS and Linux into VirusTotal, as well as ways in which Sigma rules can be converted to YARA to take advantage of VirusTotal Livehunt capabilities. In this post, we will show different approaches to hunt for interesting samples and derive new Sigma detection opportunities based on their behavior.</p>

<p>RetroArch, the popular free open-source front-end for emulators and game engines, released version 1.20.0 a few days ago.</p>
<p>The new release <strong>added illuminance sensor support</strong> for Linux users. Meaning you can play Boktai with real light, just as intended. While, it’s also working on sunlight and camera support.</p>
<p>Also for Linux, the release <strong>added audio driver and microphone driver support for Pipewire</strong>, which is a low-latency multimedia framework that’s default in recent Ubuntu, Fedora, etc distributions.</p>

<p>For a lot of us, soldering just seems to come naturally. But if we’re being honest, none of us was born with a soldering iron in our hand — ouch! — and if we’re good at soldering now, it’s only thanks to good habits and long practice. But what if you’re a company that lives and dies by the quality of the solder joints your employees produce? How do you get them to embrace the dark art of soldering?</p>

<p>The LM3914 LED bar graph driver was an amazing chip back in the day. Along with the LM3915, its logarithmic cousin, these chips gave a modern look to projects, allowing dancing LEDs to stand in for a moving coil meter. But time wore on and the chips got harder to find and even harder to fit into modern projects, what with their giant DIP-18 footprint. What’s to be done when a project cries out for bouncing LEDs? Simple — get a RISC-V microcontroller and roll your own LED audio level meter.</p>
