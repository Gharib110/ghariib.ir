<p>BC Security is the team who is currently maintaining the most active fork of <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/powershell-empire">Empire</a>. In August 2019, the <a href="https://twitter.com/xorrior/status/1156626181107736576">original maintainers</a> archived the project, but with Open-source projects <em>(as long as they don’t break software licenses</em>) other groups can take someone else’s code and improve upon it. This is exactly what BC Security did, forking the project, to keep the flame of <a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire">PowerShell Empire</a> alive.</p>

<p>We had a relationship with Mr Robot, which started during the filming of the 2nd season. While the 1st season was running, we were approached at BlackHat 2015 to give our permission to use Kali in the show. We worked out the legal parts of things (it’s legal to use Kali in media, we don’t care, but studios want that in writing), and starting in the 2nd season from time to time the production staff would reach out to us to ask us questions, have us provide them graphics, provide them with specific versions of Kali that were public on specific dates, and similar to keep the show accurate. We were very impressed with the efforts to keep the show grounded while still carrying on a strong hacking focused narrative.</p>

<p>At a higher level, the last 12 months of Kali Linux <em>(outside of the normal release items - e.g. packages updates)</em>, Kali has had various refreshes, switches and additional new features added.</p>
<p>Looking a little deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There has been a lot of <strong>graphical &amp; visual changes</strong> (e.g. desktop environments &amp; shells refreshes)</li>
<li>With a few “under-the-hood” <strong>core system changes</strong> (e.g. switching to non-root &amp; default shell)</li>
<li>With a sprinkle of <strong>end-user experience</strong> improvements (e.g. new system images &amp; message at login)</li>
<li>We have also been altering and tweaking the <strong>back end infrastructure</strong> <em>(just not been talking about it publicly in release notes)</em></li>
<li>We have also introduced various <strong>new features</strong> (e.g Kali-undercover &amp; Win-KeX)</li>
<li>Added support for <strong>new platforms</strong> &amp; improved current ones (e.g. Vagrant, AWS, ARM &amp; NetHunter)</li>
<li><em>We understand not everyone has liked the Python 2 tool removal, but it was necessary and did to help <strong>future proof Kali</strong>. We know this is a painful process, deep change like this always is. But it will only get easier as time goes by and more tools update</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Breaking it down on a per Kali release, the <strong>feature highlights</strong> from each release:</p>

<p>It’s easy to miss certain news. Not everyone is regularly checking our web page to see if something has been posted <em>(and we don’t have a regular schedule of when we update)</em>. It is easy to be drowned out in social networks with everything else going on. And RSS feeds have not been as common as they once were. So to try and help keep you in the loop with Kali Linux, we now have a newsletter option.</p>

<p>We recently released <a href="/blog/new-groups/">a new version of Signal groups</a> with group admins, @mentions, permissions, and more. Today we’re adding one more feature into the mix: group links, which let you quickly create a link that anyone can follow to join your group. Like our other new group features, you can create a new group to try it out now, but these features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups.</p>

<p>Signal has always benefitted from our engaged and supportive community, and wouldn’t be what it is without your input and feedback. As the number of people using Signal has grown, so have our efforts to keep pace with what people expect from a messaging app, and where we might find new opportunities for Signal.</p>
<p>Software companies typically overflow with data that explains the past and forecasts possible futures. They know exactly who is doing what with their products, how often, and where. While an abundance of data can contribute to their product and user experience decisions, these data collection practices are often rife with overreach and abuse. Signal doesn’t track you, collect your data, or measure which features you use. Anything and everything you do with Signal is your business. Which means that for us to dial in the features and experiences you expect calls for a respectful practice of research.</p>
