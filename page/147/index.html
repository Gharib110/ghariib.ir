		<p>There are a ton of games out there that you should play, and these are some of the classics that formulated my childhood.</p>
<p>While we hear all about the newest games as they release, there are countless classics out there that have stood the test of time for different reasons. While some are just genuinely good games, others are an important piece of history that you should try out to get a feel for what games were like at the time.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-10574<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 22 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the &lsquo;ays_save_google_credentials&rsquo; function in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Sheets integration credentials within the plugin&rsquo;s settings. Because the &lsquo;client_id&rsquo; parameter is not sanitized or escaped when used in output, this vulnerability could also be leveraged to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 7.2 | HIGH<br>

<p>Click to Read Complete This blog with GitHub repository</p>
<p>Arrow functions are a popular feature in JavaScript introduced with ES6, simplifying the way functions are written. They come in two main syntaxes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Block Body</strong>: <code>( ) =&gt; { }</code></li>
<li><strong>Concise Body</strong>: <code>( ) =&gt; ( )</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding the difference between these two syntaxes is crucial as they differ in behavior, readability, and use cases. Let’s dive into the details.</p>

		<p>I never imagined a PC building contest would get me an RTX 3080 gaming PC</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had great luck with giveaways or sweepstakes, and frankly, I stopped participating in them years ago. On a fateful day in June 2022, however, I decided to enter an online PC building contest organized by WD and Nvidia. Like always, I didn&rsquo;t really believe I&rsquo;d win something, but a few weeks later, it became a reality. My tale is 2 years old, but better late than never as they say.</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t need a full NAS to get started sharing files on your home network.</p>
<p>We all need more and more storage space for our digital files, but you don&rsquo;t always have to dive straight in to a consumer NAS with expensive hard drives. You can take an old SSD or even a flash drive and turn it into a small network drive to get you on your self-storage journey. That&rsquo;s possible because the best Wi-Fi routers have a USB port on them which can be used as a host device for things like USB modems, but also for storage drives. It&rsquo;s also fairly straightforward to enable in your router settings, so let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>

		<p>The feature had been around for ages, too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been stumped on what a word means in a Microsoft Word document, Smart Lookup always has your back. The handy tool makes it really easy to look up definitions of a word and also powers the software&rsquo;s thesaurus feature to find more ways to express what you&rsquo;re saying. If you get a lot of use out of Smart Lookup, I&rsquo;m afraid to say that Microsoft is now getting rid of it, and you may not like what comes next.</p>

		<p>Reverse all the proxies with Nginx for your NAS-powered services.</p>
<p>Running services on your network-attached storage (NAS) device is one thing but it&rsquo;s a different beast to make these securely available to the outside world with SSL certificates, DDNS, and domain names. That&rsquo;s where handy tools such as Nginx, HAProxy, and Traefik come into play. I&rsquo;ve used HAProxy extensively but recently switched to Nginx for a few reasons. These front-end services will catch incoming traffic and route it accordingly, depending on the configuration, what services you&rsquo;re hosting, and conditions set. Here&rsquo;s why you should consider Nginx when looking at reverse proxies.</p>
