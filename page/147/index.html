<p>The DoJ has indicted three Russian nationals – Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov – for operating cryptocurrency mixing services Blender[.]io and Sinbad[.]io. These mixers, used heavily by ransomware gangs and North Korean hackers, laundered criminal proceeds, including ransomware payouts and stolen cryptocurrency. Blender[.]io operated from 2018 to 2022 and helped Lazarus Group launder $500 million of the $617 million stolen in the Axie Infinity Ronin bridge attack. After the site was shut down, Sinbad[.]io emerged, offering similar services until it was seized in November 2023 in a joint law enforcement operation.</p>

<p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), set to become fully enforceable on January 17, 2025, represents a significant evolution in the regulatory landscape for financial institutions operating within, or engaging with, the European Union (EU). Although DORA is primarily targeted at entities within the EU, its implications extend globally, notably impacting U.S.-based banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) organizations that have business relationships with EU financial institutions. </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Triple Ratchet: A Bandwidth Efficient Hybrid-Secure Signal Protocol</strong><br>
<em>Yevgeniy Dodis, Daniel Jost, Shuichi Katsumata, Thomas Prest, Rolfe Schmidt</em></p>
<p>Secure Messaging apps have seen growing adoption, and are used by billions of people daily. However, due to imminent threat of a &ldquo;Harvest Now, Decrypt Later&rdquo; attack, secure messaging providers must react know in order to make their protocols $textit{hybrid-secure}$: at least as secure as before, but now also post-quantum (PQ) secure. Since many of these apps are internally based on the famous Signal&rsquo;s Double-Ratchet (DR) protocol, making Signal hybrid-secure is of great importance.</p>

		<p>I have recently discovered <code>ctypes</code> and decided to use it to manipulate Python in a way I should not. The purpose was to see some of the <em>Python&rsquo;s internals</em> at work directly from the interpreter.<br>
The article studies to the <code>CPython</code> implementation of Python 2.7.</p>
<h2 id="reference-counting-and-the-garbage-collector">Reference counting and the Garbage Collector</h2>
<p>One thing to know about Python is that its Garbage Collector uses reference counting. It means that every Python object has a <em>ref counter</em> that knows how many references are pointing to the object.<br>
Our first goal is to visualise that <em>ref counter</em> for any object from the Python interpreter.</p>

		<p>After my first article I kept playing with <code>ctypes</code> and tried to see what fun things that could be possible with little modifications to the Python&rsquo;s objects at runtime. The goal of this article is to explain how to <strong>get reliable native code execution as a simple Python objet</strong>. By reliable I mean: that, if our payload respect certain rules, we can call it multiple times from the same Python code.</p>

		<p>Lately, I have been looking at the Python&rsquo;s execution model. I was curious about the implementation of some opcodes like <code>YIELD_VALUE</code> and <code>YIELD_FROM</code>, how were compiled list comprehensions, generator expressions and other fun Python features, and what happens at the bytecode level when exceptions were raised. Reading the <code>CPython</code> code is really instructive, but I was feeling like something was missing to fully understand the bytecode execution and the stack evolution. Yeah, <code>GDB</code> is cool but I&rsquo;m a lazy guy who wanted a high-level interface and code some Python.</p>

	<div>
		<p>When it comes to tech careers, web development and software development often get tossed around like they&rsquo;re the same thing. But they&rsquo;re not. Web development is like crafting the storefront of a shop, making it look good and work well for customers. Software development, on the other hand, is like building tools and applications that people use, whether on a computer, phone, or other devices. Both are super important in the tech world, but they require different skills and focus on different things. Let&rsquo;s dive into what sets them apart and what you need to know if you&rsquo;re thinking about a career in either field.</p>
