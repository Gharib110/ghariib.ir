<p>As your city adopts Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to enhance mobility and safety, securing these interconnected networks is more critical than ever. The distributed nature of ITS networks, IT-OT convergence, limited physical security controls, and vulnerabilities in interconnected IoT devices can pose significant challenges. When physical and operational systems converge, the risks grow â€“ cyberattacks can have real-world consequences.</p>
<p>If you manage transportation systems, you face fragmented tools and siloed approaches among government agencies, private operators and vendors. This lack of coordination complicates the protection of real-time critical operations. Meanwhile, railroads and public transit remain prime targets for operational disruption, financial harm and geopolitical agendas, with nearly a third of threats coming from insiders.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Cloud-native infrastructure is still evolving, and one thing that&rsquo;s clear is the need for scalability and efficiency in managing your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. Hosted control planes (HCP) is a paradigm-shifting approach in OpenShift designed to optimize the way control planes are deployed and operated. For cluster service providers operating Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift, the HCP model aligns perfectly with the demands of modern infrastructure. By separating concerns of management and workloads, providers can achieve better resource utilization with high density control, help ensur</p>

<h2 id="detection-content-creation-submission--release">Detection Content Creation, Submission &amp; Release</h2>
<p>December was another impressive month for the Threat Bounty Program, with the community showcasing a collaborative spirit and detection engineering skills.</p>
<p>Despite the end-of-year hustle, Program members continued actively submitting detections to address emerging threats. In total, 33 new detection rules were successfully released to the SOC Prime Platform after being validated by the team of SOC Primeâ€™s experts.</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-changes-and-program-enhancements">Ongoing Changes and Program Enhancements</h2>
<p>Starting January 2025, we have temporarily suspended the acceptance of new Threat Bounty detections. While the <strong>Threat Bounty Program activities are on hold</strong>, we are working on several enhancements to the SOC Prime Platform that aim to improve the overall experience for all users and extend opportunities for Threat Bounty Program members, including submission of content across different formats and additional ways to monetize your work. See details here.</p>

</p>
<p>A simple yet intriguing idea is worth sharing, even if it wasnâ€™t a flawless success: it can inspire others. [Richard]â€™s experiment with a motion-powered AirTag fits this bill. Starting with our call for simple projects, [Richard] came up with a circuit that selectively powers an AirTag based on movement. His concept was to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a microcontroller to switch the AirTag on only when itâ€™s on the move, creating a stealthy and battery-efficient tracker.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The evolution of computing has been marked by a series of remarkable technology transitions, each reshaping industries, economies, and everyday life. From the early days of mainframes to the rise of cloud computing and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), these transitions have been pivotal in defining the digital age we live in today. Some of the most significant changes in computing history have had a profound impact on how we interact with technology and how businesses and individuals leverage the power of computing. These large-scale transitions were not just incremental improvements but transformative shifts that forever altered the landscape of technology and society.</p>

<p>The post Supporting the next generation of developers appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>We believe that software is at the center of human progress and that all software builds on the work of others, especially open source, through an interconnected community of developers. We need to level the playing field to spark innovation on a global level, and that includes helping early developers get the best start possible. We believe that all developers can solve problems, innovate, and create collaboratively through code. This is why we aspire to empower 1 billion individuals to become developers, and work to help break down barriers to entry for those who wish to join the field and participate in the community.</p>

		<p><strong>2025: AI, Sustainability, Local Clouds, and Data Detox</strong></p>
<p>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Predicting 2025.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2025! where technology doesn&rsquo;t just evolve; it grows, adapts, and occasionally drawing interests at our habits. From mind-liked communication that might finally feel texting a thing of the past, to 3D-printed organs(because who wouldn&rsquo;t want to have a backup heart and organs on our hand, right?), the innovations of the future are set to not only disrupt industries but to redefine how one can live, work, and maybe even procrastinate. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll explore the most mind-blowing, game-changing technologies that might become a mainstream in coming years, and let us just say-the future? It might just be stranger (and more exciting) than we think.<br>
So, get ready for a sneak peak into this chapter of human innovation!</p>
