		<p>As of October 2023, researchers at Bitdefender Labs have been actively keeping tabs on steam-jacking attacks against high-profile YouTube accounts used to conduct a myriad of crypto doubling scams.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2024; our investigation into the fraudulent takeovers and usage of YouTube accounts has rendered new findings, as financially motivated threat actors meticulously evolve their attacks.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of months, stream-jacking attacks have steadily evolved, and our research show</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of those &ldquo;your parcel couldn&rsquo;t be delivered&rdquo; phishing attacks lately and if you&rsquo;re a human with a phone, you probably have been too. Just as a brief reminder, they look like this:</p>

<p>I actually thought that once I didn’t bother connecting a landline after moving house recently, it would be the end of scam calls. I used to get them all the time – the ones where they’d call up and say you had viruses on your PC – and my recordings of those turned out to be rather popular. But today I had another call, although this one went a bit differently.</p>

</p>
<p>As the European Union solidifies the framework for the EUDI (European Digital Identity) wallet, the certification process outlined in the Implementing Acts has made significant progress. By establishing the certification requirements for the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (WSCD) and the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application (WSCA), the act lays down important steps toward ensuring the security of this critical digital identity solution. However, challenges remain—particularly in how these certifications interact and how the evolving nature of mobile applications like the WSCA might create bottlenecks in achieving a truly secure and agile EUDI wallet. </p>

</p>
<p>The conundrum I refer to in the title of this post is the one faced by a breached organisation: disclose or suppress? And let me be even more specific: should they disclose to <em>impacted individuals,</em> or simply never let them know? I&rsquo;m writing this after many recent such discussions with breached organisations where I&rsquo;ve found myself wishing I had this blog post to point them to, so, here it is.</p>

<p>They asked me to censor the Bitcoin address because as you can see above, it’s unique to them and quite understandably, they don’t want anything that can tie this blackmail attempt back to them going public. Except that the address is a perfect match with this one:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been harbouring some thoughts about the state of data breaches over recent months, and I feel they&rsquo;ve finally manifested themselves into a cohesive enough story to write down. Parts of this story relate to very sensitive incidents and parts to criminal activity, not just on behalf of those executing data breaches but also very likely on behalf of some organisations handling them. As such, I&rsquo;m not going to refer to any specific incidents or company names, rather I&rsquo;m going to speak more generally to what I&rsquo;m seeing in the industry.</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote about The State of Data Breaches and got loads of feedback. It was predominantly sympathetic to the position I find myself in running HIBP, and that post was mostly one of frustration: lack of disclosure, standoffish organisations, downplaying breaches and the individual breach victims themselves making it worse by going to town on the corporate victims. But the other angle that&rsquo;s been milling around in my brain is the one represented by the image here:</p>
