<p><em>At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been developing open source “consumer-facing” software for the past four years. We want to share some of the things we’ve learned while doing it.</em></p>
<p>As a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers. Unlike software, when they create something, it is really done — forever. A recorded album can be just the same 20 years later, but software has to change.</p>

<p>Today marks an important milestone for us with the first public release of our <strong>Kali Linux rolling distribution</strong>. Kali switched to a rolling release model back when we hit <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/">version 2.0</a></strong> (codename), however the rolling release was only available via an upgrade from 2.0 to kali-rolling for a select brave group. After 5 months of testing our rolling distribution (and its supporting infrastructure), we’re confident in its reliability - giving our users the best of all worlds - the stability of Debian, together with the latest versions of the many outstanding <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">penetration testing tools</a> created and shared by the information security community.</p>

<p>Back in 2012, <a href="http://conference.hackinthebox.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/D1T2%20-%20Mark%20Dowd%20&amp;%20Tarjei%20Mandt%20-%20iOS6%20Security.pdf">Mark and I detailed</a> a number of iOS kernel mitigations that were introduced in iOS 6 to prevent an attacker from leveraging well-known exploitation techniques such as the zone free list pointer overwrite. Most of these mitigations rely on entropy (of varying degree) provided by the kernel, and are therefore supported by a separate random number generator known as the <strong>early_random()</strong> PRNG. As this generator is fundamental to the robustness of these mitigations, and has received additional improvements in iOS 7, it is unarguably a very interesting target that deserves further study.</p>
