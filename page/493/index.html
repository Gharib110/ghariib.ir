		<p>The Australian financial services regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), has provided its most substantial guidance on generative AI to date in Member Therese McCarthy Hockey’s remarks to the AFIA Risk Summit 2024. The guidance gives a green light for banks, insurance companies, and superannuation funds to accelerate their adoption of this transformative technology, but reminded the financial services industry of the need for adequate guardrails to make sure that the benefits of generative AI don’t come at an unacceptable cost to the community.</p>

<p>Especially within the world of multi-threaded programming does atomic access become a crucial topic, as multiple execution contexts may seek to access the same memory locations at the same time. Yet the exact meaning of the word ‘atomic’ is also essential here, as there is in fact not just a single meaning of the word within the world of computer science. One type of atomic access refers merely to whether a single value can be written or read atomically (e.g. reading or writing a 32-bit integer on a 32-bit system versus a 16-bit system), whereas atomic operations are a whole other kettle of atomic fish.</p>

<p>We all know that “Can it run <em>DOOM</em>?” is the first question of a hardware hacker. The 1993 first person shooter from id Software defined an entire genre of games, and has since been made open source, appearing on almost everything. Everything, that is, except a Captcha, those annoying “Are you a human” tests where we’re all expected to do a search giant’s image classification for them. So here’s [Guillermo Rauch] with a <em>DOOM</em> captcha, in which you must gun down three bad guys to proceed.</p>
