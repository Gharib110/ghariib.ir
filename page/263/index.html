	<div>
		<p>Many organizations use Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization to manage and deploy virtualized workloads alongside containerized ones on the same unified OpenShift platform. For those prioritizing virtualization, Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine, a new edition of OpenShift, provides a dedicated option focused entirely on virtualization workloads. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling virtual machines by removing non-virtualization capabilities that they may not currently need. This targeted approach ensures teams can maximize the value of OpenShift Virtualization while</p>

		<p>The fourth episode is dedicated to the most analyzed family of applications: communication and social networking apps.</p>
<p>Before I start, I would like to mention that I have made some corrections to the previous blog post, based on feedback by tool developers. Also, most of them have confirmed to me that they are working on improving their parsing capabilities, based on this blog series. I am happy to support them in that direction!</p>

		<p>I am finally back with the third blog post in the series!</p>
<p>Before I introduce this new post, I want to point out some updates to the previous blog post. </p>
<p>I have corrected a couple of errors related to the Belkasoft tool, in particular the device UDID and the device phone number.</p>
<p>Also, after the blog post, Alexis Brignoni released some new iLEAPP parsers that cover most of the “red” boxes and MSAB confirmed to me that they have already fixed all the “red” boxes from the previous blog post. At the end of the series, I will re-process the dataset with the latest version of the various tools, and create a separate table with the updated comparison.</p>

		<p>As explained in the first blog post, I would like to start discussing the acquisition and processing details.</p>
<p>The acquisition was done by Josh Hickman using the Cellebrite Premium tool and the result is a Full File System capture in the traditional file format created by UFED.</p>
<p>If you open the file EXTRACTION _FFS.zip ZIP you will see that UFED organizes the extracted full file system into 5 subfolders;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>filesystem1</strong>: extraction of system partition, without the mount point “/private/var/mobile/” (“user data&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>filesystem2:</strong> extraction of the mount point for user data (“/private/var/mobile”)</li>
<li><strong>metadata1:</strong> metadata for files stored in “filesystem1”</li>
<li><strong>metadata1:</strong> metadata for files stored in “filesystem2”</li>
<li><strong>extra:</strong> iOS Keychain</li>
</ul>

		<p>Following up my previous blog post, I decided to create a curated list of iOS Forensics References, organized by folder with specific references (links to blog post, research paper, articles, and so on) for each interesting file. </p>
<p>The list is available as a GitHub repository to make it easier to keep it updated. If you have any proposal for addition in terms of file/folders or a specific reference, please let me know and I&rsquo;ll be happy to add it to the list.</p>

		<p>Hello world, it’s been a while since my last series of blog posts! But now I am ready to share with you the results of my recent research.</p>
<p>I face many different challenges in my daily work as a digital forensics analyst, who deals mainly with mobile devices. <strong>All modern smartphones are encrypted</strong> (usually with file-based encryption (FBE)), so obtaining or cracking the passcode is required to gain access to all the data stored on the device. And even if we know the passcode (or the user has not set the passcode, which is increasingly rare these days), we still need an exploit to gain “root” access to the device to read and copy all the data and get our “best acquisition”, usually a full file system (FFS).</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of mobile forensics, where extracting data is the first (and arguably the most critical) step. Whether you’re working with an ancient Apple device or attempting to break into the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, there is a method for every gadget – each with its own share of challenges. We love explaining the differences between the extraction techniques, detailing their pros and contras, but sometimes you are limited to the one and only method that is the most likely to succeed.</p>

		<p>This blog is reserved for more serious things, and ordinarily I wouldn’t spend time on questions like the above. But much as I’d like to spend my time writing about exciting topics, sometimes the world requires a bit of what Brad Delong calls “Intellectual Garbage Pickup,” namely: correcting wrong, or mostly-wrong ideas that spread unchecked across the Internet.</p>
<p>This post is inspired by the recent and concerning news that Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov has been arrested by French authorities for its failure to sufficiently moderate content. While I don’t know the details, the use of criminal charges to coerce social media companies is a pretty worrying escalation, and I hope there’s more to the story.</p>
