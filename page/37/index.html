		<p>Why crypto exchanges struggle to guard against targeted attacks, and how to store cryptocurrency threat-free.</p>
<p>February 21 was a dark day for the crypto market as it suffered the largest heist in its history. Attackers made off with around $1.5 billion from Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, with experts citing it as the biggest theft – of anything – of all time. Although neither this loss nor the withdrawal of a further $5 billion by panicked investors were fatal for Bybit, the incident underscores the fundamental flaws in the modern crypto ecosystem, and serves up some valuable lessons for regular users.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When hackers started using automation and AI, traditional cybersecurity stopped being enough. During the past years, security teams focused more on proactively searching for hidden threats and stopping their escalation. And this is exactly what threat hunting does. Instead of waiting for an alert, security experts investigate unusual behavior, correlate data, and uncover hidden attacks. […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is designed to simplify the experience of building, deploying, and managing Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a bootc container image. It reduces complexity across the enterprise by letting development, operations, and solution providers use the same container-native tools and techniques to manage everything from applications to the underlying OS. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve written several articles detailing the experience of using image mode. We discussed the various use cases of image mode, creating automated CI/CD pipelines, managing containerized workloads, the full GitOps experience for sysadmins of RHEL, and how image mode facilitates building software appliances. There is plenty to talk about.</p>

		<p>DeepSeek and vLLM optimizations have been a top priority for our team and the vLLM community as a whole, and we are excited to share a deep dive into our work. In this article, we will cover the key inference improvements we have made, detail the integration of DeepSeek’s latest advancements into vLLM, and discuss how we are scaling DeepSeek-R1 for real-world deployment. Additionally, we will review the various open source contributions from DeepSeek and outline our roadmap for integrating them into vLLM.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Modern websites rely heavily on JavaScript. Leveraging third-party scripts accelerates web app development, enabling organizations to deploy new features faster without building everything from scratch. However, supply chain attacks targeting third-party JavaScript are no longer just a theoretical concern — they have become a reality, as recent incidents have shown. Given the vast number of scripts and the rapid pace of updates, manually reviewing each one is not a scalable security strategy.</p>

Is Huawei planning to ship Linux on its upcoming MateBook laptops instead of HarmonyOS NEXT? A fresh leak out of China this week suggests so. Huawei is no stranger to selling laptops with Linux. Various models in its MateBook 13, 14, 15, and MateBook X Pro lines have been sold in both Windows and Linux configurations, with the latter typically exclusive to China and reloaded with Debian-based Deepin. The—somewhat contentious—company has previously said all PCs released in 2025 would run the newer home-grown, closed-source HarmonyOS NEXT (viewed as an effort to wean reliance off of western-led tech companies, solidify control, […]</p>

		<p>Bitdefender&rsquo;s security researchers have identified a large-scale ad fraud campaign that deployed hundreds of malicious apps in the Google Play Store, resulting in more than 60 million downloads total. The apps display out-of-context ads and even try to persuade victims to give away credentials and credit card information in phishing attacks.</p>
