		<p>Ah our favourite database in the news again, being hailed as the MongoDB Ransack a whole bunch of people have turned the insecure MongoDB default configuration into a ransom opportunity. They are deleting/stealing databases and soliciting bitcoin payments to return the data. With multiple actors doing the same stuff though it’s hard to know who […]</p>

Mozilla’s overall revenue saw a sizeable boost in 2023, despite a drop in income from its lucrative search engine deals. According to its latest financial report, Mozilla’s revenue in 2023 hit <del>$653 million (US), up from <del>$593 million in 2022. The cause of the increase? Not any flashy new products, services, or deals – just ol’ fashioned interest and dividends (</del>$47 million) and returns on its investments (</del>$24 million). In fact, Mozilla’s income from search engine deals actually fell by ~$15 million in 2023. Revenue from ads, sponsored links, and its own product subscriptions (like Pocket) also dipped by ~$9 […]</p>

		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apple products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
