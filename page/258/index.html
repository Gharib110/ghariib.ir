<p>A Mirai botnet variant has been found exploiting a newly disclosed security flaw impacting Four-Faith industrial routers since early November 2024 with the goal of conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>The botnet maintains approximately 15,000 daily active IP addresses, with the infections primarily scattered across China, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and the United States.</p>
<p>Exploiting an arsenal of over 20 known security vulnerabilities and weak Telnet credentials for initial access, the malware is known to have been active since February 2024. The botnet has been dubbed “gayfemboy” in reference to the offensive term present in the source code.</p>

	<b><time>15.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console. FortiOS is the Fortinet’s proprietary Operation System which is utilized across multiple product lines. FortiProxy is a secure web gateway that attempts to protects users against internet-borne attacks, and provides protection and visibility to the network against unauthorized access and threats. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Multiple Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Avalanche, the most severe of which could allow for authentication bypass. Ivanti Avalanche is a mobile device management system. Network security features allow one to manage wireless settings (including encryption and authentication) and apply those settings on a schedule throughout the network. Successful exploitation could allow for a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication. Depending on the privileges associated with the logged-on user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have found that bad actors are continuing to have success by spoofing sender email addresses as part of various malspam campaigns.</p>
<p>Faking the sender address of an email is widely seen as an attempt to make the digital missive more legitimate and get past security mechanisms that could otherwise flag it as malicious.</p>
<p>While there are safeguards such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) that can be used to prevent spammers from spoofing well-known domains, such measures have increasingly led them to leverage old, neglected domains in their operations.</p>
