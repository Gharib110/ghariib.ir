	<div>
		<p>AI applications are rapidly evolving, and with the right tools, building flexible and efficient systems has never been easier. One such powerful tool is <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong>, a technique that allows you to pass dynamic data, configurations, or even database connections directly to your tools. This enhances the flexibility and scalability of your agents, making them more adaptable and powerful. With <strong>PydanticAI</strong>, DI is seamlessly integrated, making it simpler to handle and manipulate structured data.</p>

		<p>How to work with suppliers to reduce the risk of incidents related to supply-chain cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The old saying, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link”, directly applies to enterprise cybersecurity. Businesses these days often rely on dozens or even hundreds of suppliers and contractors, who, in turn, use the services and products of yet more contractors and suppliers. And when these chains involve not raw materials but complex IT products, ensuring their security becomes significantly more challenging. This fact is exploited by attackers, who compromise a link in the chain to reach its end — their main target. Accordingly, it’s essential for business leaders and the heads of IT and information security to understand the risks of supply-chain attacks in order to manage them effectively.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Trustless Bridges via Random Sampling Light Clients</strong><br>
<em>Bhargav Nagaraja Bhatt, Fatemeh Shirazi, Alistair Stewart</em></p>
<p>The increasing number of blockchain projects introduced annually has led to a pressing need for secure and efficient interoperability solutions. Currently, the lack of such solutions forces end-users to rely on centralized intermediaries, contradicting the core principle of decentralization and trust minimization in blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and efficient interoperability solution (aka Bridge Protocol) that operates without additional trust assumptions, relying solely on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) of the two chains being connected. In particular, relayers (actors that exchange messages between networks) are permissionless and decentralized, hence eliminating any single point of failure. We introduce Random Sampling, a novel technique for on-chain light clients to efficiently follow the history of PoS blockchains by reducing the signature verifications required. Here, the randomness is drawn on-chain, for example, using Ethereum&rsquo;s RANDAO. We analyze the security of the bridge from a crypto- economic perspective and provide a framework to derive the security parameters. This includes handling subtle concurrency issues and randomness bias in strawman designs. While the protocol is applicable to various PoS chains, we demonstrate its feasibility by instantiating a bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum (currently deployed), and discuss some practical security challenges. We also evaluate the efficiency (gas costs) of an on-chain light-client verifier implemented as a smart contract on ethereum against SNARK-based approaches. Even for large validator set sizes (up to $10^6$), the signature verification gas costs of our light-client verifier are a magnitude lower.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding optional static types. This means that while you can write JavaScript in TypeScript, you also have the ability to define the types of variables, function parameters, and objects, leading to improved code quality and developer experience. Types in TypeScript allow you to specify what kind of data can be used, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.</p>

<p>What if your old, neglected toys could come to life — with a bit of sass? That’s exactly what [Binh] achieved when he transformed his sister’s worn-out teddy bear into ‘Ted’, an interactive talking plush with a personality of its own. This project, which combines the GLaDOS Personality Core project from the <em>Portal</em> series with clever microcontroller tinkering, brings a whole new personality to a childhood favorite.</p>
