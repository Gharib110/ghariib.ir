		<p>Job Posting: <strong>Faculty position in Computer Science</strong><br>
<em>Free University of Brussels</em></p>
<p>The Faculty of Sciences of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) invites applications for a full-time academic position in Computer Science to begin October 1st, 2025. All areas of Computer Science, <strong>including Cryptography</strong>, will be considered.</p>
<p>ULB and the Computer Science Department is <strong>strongly committed to improving gender equality</strong>. Therefore, a proactive attitude to supporting and encouraging underrepresented groups, particularly women in Computer Science, will be one of the criteria for appointment. To combat the under-representation of women in STEM disciplines, the University will ensure that a minimum of 30% of women with the required qualifications are on the shortlist. Additionally, other criteria being equal, the appointment will be given to a woman. The scheme also includes awareness raising of unconscious biases among members of selection boards.</p>

<p>In a world driven by rapid development and continuous innovation, failure isn’t always a setback—in fact, it can be a <strong>winning strategy</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about <em>Fail Fast</em>, a fundamental methodology in software development that aims to quickly identify the limitations and critical issues of a solution.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-fail-fast"><strong>What is Fail Fast?</strong></h4>
<p><em>Fail Fast</em> is an approach with a single goal: to find a potential stopping point. If Descartes said <em>Cogito ergo sum</em> (I think, therefore I am), here we could say <em>Deficio ergo sum</em> (I fail, therefore I exist).</p>

Mozilla Firefox 134 has landed, making the browser’s first release of the new year. It’s been a month since Firefox 133 delivered time-saving tab overview access, beefed up bounce tracking protection, finessed flaws with Flatpak file opening, and smoothed out issues causing slow DNS lookup/connection timings on 64-bit Linux distributions. Do the changes in Firefox 134 best those? Let’s take a look! Firefox 134: New Features Touch hold gestures on Linux On Linux, Firefox 134 supports touchpad hold gestures. This allows kinetic scrolling to be stopped simply by placing two fingers on the touchpad. If you ever scroll down a lengthy article […]</p>

		<p>When Southwest Airlines’ crew scheduling system became overwhelmed during the 2022 holiday season, the company faced what would become a $800 million operational meltdown. CIO Lauren Woods and her technology team hadn’t caused the crisis, but they would need to solve it. </p>
<p>“I liken it to being like a designated driver at a party,” Woods reflects. “You didn’t bring the Wild Turkey, but all of a sudden you’re responsible for getting everybody home safe.”</p>
