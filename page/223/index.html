		<p>CES 2025 was packed with announcements, but here&rsquo;s all you need to know about AMD and Nvidia.</p>
<p>If you somehow missed it, CES 2025 happened earlier this month and it was a blast for PC hardware announcements. AMD outed a bunch of new processors, as did Intel, and Nvidia announced the new GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards. We&rsquo;ve covered each announcement here at XDA, but if you&rsquo;d like an easily digestible roundup of what AMD and Nvidia announced, I&rsquo;ve got you covered with the heavy-hitting news right here.</p>

<p>In my previous blog, we ran through what NIS2 is and who it applies to. In this second part of the series, I’ll break down the main requirements you’ll find in NIS2 and help translate them into actionable and practical measures you can take to achieve NIS2 compliance. Join me in this post and start understanding what NIS2 is all about.</p>
<h1 id="ok-nis2-is-applicable-to-you-now-what-do-you-need-to-do-to-achieve-nis2-compliance"><strong>Ok, NIS2 is applicable to you. Now, what do you need to do to achieve NIS2 Compliance?</strong> </h1>
<p>If you are reading this, you probably came to the conclusion that EU NIS2 is applicable to your company. Let’s dig into the requirements and what you need to do to become compliant.</p>

<p>If you love reading books and have yet to experience an e-reader, we highly recommend giving it a try. Not only are you able to carry thousands of books on a single device, but it&rsquo;s also better for the eyes when compared to a tablet or smartphone. Of course, there are lots of different options out there, but we recommend going with Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle.</p>
