<p>If hacking on consumer hardware is about figuring out what it can do, and pushing it in directions that the manufacturer never dared to dream, then this is a very fine hack indeed. [Portasynthica3] takes on the Yamaha PSR-E433, a cheap beginner keyboard, discovers a shell baked into it, and takes it from there.</p>
<p>[Portasynthinca3] reverse engineered the firmware, wrote shellcode for the device, embedded the escape in a MIDI note stream, and even ended up writing some simple LCD driver software totally decent refresh rate on the dot-matrix display, all to support the lofty goal of displaying arbitrary graphics on the keyboard’s dot-matrix character display.</p>

		<p>What’s holding you back from making money with open-source software? Is it fear? A lack of direction? Or maybe you think the market is “too saturated.” Stop it. Right now. Open source isn’t just a playground for hobbyists and code nerds; it’s a goldmine waiting for <em>you</em> to take action. But here’s the catch—you need to stop overthinking and start moving. Ready? Let’s get to work.</p>
<h2 id="1-sell-your-expertise-turn-knowledge-into-cash"><strong>1. Sell Your Expertise: Turn Knowledge into Cash</strong></h2>
<p>Do you know more than the average person about an open-source tool? Perfect. That’s your edge. Start offering your services to businesses that use that software but don’t know how to maximize it. Whether it’s <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, or <strong>Linux</strong>, companies will pay top dollar to save time and headaches.</p>

	<div>
		<p>We’ve all been there. Sitting on ideas, drowning in analysis, and talking about the future like it’s guaranteed. Guess what? It’s not. Overthinking is the silent killer of dreams. You don’t need a perfect plan—you need a plan you’ll execute. Let’s dive in and get to work. No fluff, no excuses.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don’t Over-Promise, Just Over-Deliver</strong></p>
<p>When you bite off more than you can chew, you set yourself up for failure and disappointment. Over-promising might sound impressive in the moment, but under-delivering kills credibility—fast. Instead, under-promise and then blow people’s expectations out of the water.</p>

		<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In September 2024, LevelBlue conducted a comprehensive threat hunt targeting artifacts indicative of Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) activity across our monitored customer fleet. During the investigation, the LevelBlue Managed Detection and Response (MDR) Blue Team discovered a new PhaaS kit, now identified as RaccoonO365. The hunt confirmed true-positive compromises of Office 365 accounts, prompting swift customer notifications and guidance on remediation actions. The initial findings were handed over to the LevelBlue Labs Threat Intelligence team, which further uncovered additional infrastructure and deconstructed the kit’s JavaScript. This analysis provided critical insights into the features and capabilities of the emerging PhaaS kit.</p>

	<b><time>23.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Ansible execution environments provide a reusable and supported operating environment for running Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. These container-based instances provide everything that the desired automation needs to execute successfully, including any of the necessary dependencies and supporting components, while also eliminating many of the challenges faced when running automation at scale. During the process of building execution environments, there may be a need to access content from sources that require authentication. Hardcoding these properties into the build process may present a security concern and does not align with recommended operating practices. In this article, I will present several areas where hardcoded properties are typically used when building execution environments and the alternative options available to produce software more securely.</p>

<p>With ready availability of single board computers, displays, keyboards, power packs, and other hardware, a home-made laptop is now a project within most people’s reach. Some laptop projects definitely veer towards being cyberdecks while others take a more conventional path, but we’ve rarely seen one as professional looking as [Byran Huang]’s anyon_e open source laptop. It really takes the art to the next level.</p>
<p>The quality is immediately apparent in the custom CNC-machined anodised aluminium case, and upon opening it up the curious user could be forgiven for thinking they had a stylish commercial machine in their hands. There’s a slimline mechanical keyboard and a glass trackpad, and that display is an OLED. In fact the whole thing had been built from scratch, and inside is an RK3588 SoC on a module sitting on a custom-designed motherboard. It required some effort for it to drive the display, a process we’ve seen cause pain to other designers, but otherwise it runs Debian. The batteries are slimline pouch cells, with a custom controller board driven by an ESP32.</p>
