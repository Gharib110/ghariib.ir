<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 15, 2025</p>
<p>Many people have idly fantasized about wanting to be rid of their ex, or boss, or perhaps a celebrity. But a few, motivated by hatred, jealousy or rage, have taken matters a step further.</p>
<p>The Times reports that a hitman-for-hire website set up on the dark web is estimated to have taken more than £400,000 from individuals who have ordered the deaths of about 175 innocent people. Unbeknown to its customers, the website is a scam by criminals — but the threat to the targets is real.</p>

<h1 id="how-will-your-role-work-with-ai">How Will Your Role Work with AI? </h1>
<p><em><strong>Author: Hugo Farinha, co-founder of Virtuoso QA</strong></em></p>
<p>Integrating AI sensitively into the workplace while acknowledging the perceptions, negative and positive, around the impact AI may have is going to be an essential skill for the C-suite over the next few years. The landscape will shift, putting greater emphasis on certain skills that will be needed to cover the requirements of working alongside AI, and others better suited for areas where human involvement is still essential… </p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>While working on a POC I accidentally set a bucket policy like this one &hellip;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
    &#34;Version&#34;: &#34;2012-10-17&#34;,
    &#34;Statement&#34;: [{
        &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;s3:*&#34;,
        &#34;Effect&#34;: &#34;Deny&#34;,
        &#34;Resource&#34;: [
            &#34;arn:aws:s3:::dummybucket&#34;,
            &#34;arn:aws:s3:::dummybucket/*&#34;
        ],
        &#34;Principal&#34;: &#34;*&#34;
    }]
}
</code></pre><p>Yeah &hellip; That&rsquo;s the problem of copy&amp;paste and a barely edit without double check. A policy that caused a bunch of errors and locked me out of the bucket, even though I had an AdministratorAccess policy.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the fix would be easy—just delete the bucket policy using root access. But there was a catch, the bucket was in an account that’s part of an AWS Organization, and by default, member accounts don’t have root credentials.</p>

		<p>GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub, and our CLI extensions are no exception. Read on to find out how we built the GitHub Skyline CLI extension using GitHub!</p>
<p>The post How we built the GitHub Skyline CLI extension using GitHub appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>In December 2024, we announced gh-skyline, a GitHub CLI extension that allows our developer community to generate a 3D version of their GitHub Contribution Graph into an STL file ready for printing on a 3D printer, just in time to capture all of those contributions!</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Why pay out big bucks for UI design when you can use this instead.</p>
<p>Sketch and Figma are two of the popular UI/UX design tools out there. While Figma’s free plan feels restrictive, Sketch is an outright paid app. Being a freelancer or a newcomer in the field, the monthly subscription fees for design tools can really put a dent in your budget. That’s where Penpot comes in, which offers a powerful yet affordable solution to anyone who doesn’t compromise on quality.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As our Microsoft AI Tour reached Brussels, Paris, and Berlin toward the end of last year, we met with European organizations that were energized by the possibilities of our latest AI technologies and engaged in deployment projects. They were also alert to the fact that 2025 is the year that key obligations under the European Union’s AI Act come into effect, opening a new chapter in digital regulation as the world’s first, comprehensive AI law becomes a reality.  </p>

	<div>
		<p>Most container-based development starts with a base image on top of which developers can layer any additional libraries, binaries, and files needed to run an application. The Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) is a collection of OCI-compliant, freely redistributable, container-based images. These images are designed to be a foundation for cloud-native and web application use cases, maintained and updated regularly by Red Hat. While most Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) packages (RPMs) are available as a freely redistributable part of UBI images, there are use cases where developers need to install RPMs that require an active RHEL subscription (entitlement) for building images (i.e., via Dockerfile).</p>
