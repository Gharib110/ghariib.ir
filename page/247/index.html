<p><strong><em>Author: Richard Farrell, CIO at</em> <em>Netcall</em></strong></p>
<p>Whilst 2024 saw the adoption of <strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> accelerate, it also witnessed significant debates and challenges surrounding its use within business from security and data privacy perspectives, with questions surrounding its true value.</p>
<p>As CIOs prepare to tackle AI in 2025, Richard Farrell, CIO of Netcall, shares the top trends that must be prioritised in the year ahead to ensure successful adoption.</p>

Enlightenment 0.27, released this week, brings a wealth of incremental improvements to users of this unique desktop environment. Though not as well known or widely used as GNOME, Xfce, KDE Plasma, et al, Enlightenment (often abbreviated as just ‘E’) differentiates itself through the use of Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). An assembly of modules, Enlightenment offers a lightweight window manager, compositor, and desktop shell built using Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), plus a small set of native EFL-based apps including a file manager, photo viewer, and terminal. Enlightenment’s aesthetics aren’t to everyone’s tastes (it’d be a boring world if it did; most […]</p>

<p>Enlightenment, the extremely lightweight window manager and minimal desktop, released new 0.27.0 few days ago.</p>
<p>According to the official release note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is the latest release of Enlightenment. This has a lot of fixes mostly with some new features.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing else!</p>
<p>But if you’re interested in this new e27 release, here are the changes that I summarized by digging through the source page.</p>

<p>First, e27 <strong>reduced CPU usage when gaming with proto/steam</strong>. These games change their props all the time, causing e to keep looking things up. The developer updated the code to workaround that can drop CPU usage drastically by about 60-70% or more.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR — Email addresses in stealer logs can now be queried in HIBP to discover which websites they&rsquo;ve had credentials exposed against.

<p>Using a firewall is essential to secure the installation of the extraction agent when performing low-level extraction from a variety of iOS devices. We developed two solutions: a software-based firewall for macOS and a hardware-based firewall using a Raspberry Pi (or similar microcomputer) with our own custom firmware. This guide will help you choose the best option for your needs.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let us clarify that the solutions described in this article are neither traditional nor fully-featured firewalls. Instead, they are designed to restrict internet access to specific endpoints during a critical phase of the sideloading process.</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced web development world, creating visually appealing and responsive user interfaces is crucial. One popular solution to this problem is Tailwind CSS.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-tailwind-css">What is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
<p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without having to leave your HTML. Instead of writing custom stylesheets, you can apply predefined classes to your elements to quickly style them. This approach helps in maintaining a clean and manageable codebase, as each class corresponds to a specific style (like colors, spacing, and typography).</p>

<em>Gefei Tan, Adrià Gascón, Sarah Meiklejohn, Mariana Raykova, Xiao Wang, Ning Luo</em></p>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs of training (zkPoT) allow a party to prove that a model is trained correctly on a committed dataset without revealing any additional information about the model or the dataset. Existing zkPoT protocols prove the entire training process in zero knowledge; i.e., they prove that the final model was obtained in an iterative fashion starting from the training data and a random seed (and potentially other parameters) and applying the correct algorithm at each iteration. This approach inherently requires the prover to perform work linear to the number of iterations.</p>

		<p>A new set of Git releases were published to address a variety of security vulnerabilities. All users are encouraged to upgrade. Take a look at GitHub’s view of the latest round of releases.</p>
<p>The post Git security vulnerabilities announced appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Today, the Git project released new versions to address a pair of security vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-50349 and CVE-2024-52006, that affect all prior versions of Git.</p>
<h2 id="cve-2024-50349">CVE-2024-50349</h2>
<p>When Git needs to fill in credentials interactively without the use of a credential helper, it prints out the hostname and asks the user to fill in the appropriate username/password pair for that host. However, Git prints out the hostname after URL-decoding it. This allows an attacker to craft URLs containing ANSI escape sequences that may be used to construct an intentionally misleading prompt. The attacker may then tweak the prompt to trick a user into providing credentials for a different Git host back to the attacker.</p>

When GNOME 48 is released in March it will debut with a brand-new audio player. Per a recent merge request, Decibels graduates from GNOME Incubator to GNOME Core Apps as part of GNOME 48, making the software something GNOME recommends downstream Linux distributions include to give users a fully-featured GNOME experience. You may be familiar with or even using Decibels already. I wrote about the app in late 2023, and it’s been available to install from Flathub for almost as long. For anyone not familiar with it, Decibels is a no-frills audio player designed for the GNOME desktop (but can […]</p>
