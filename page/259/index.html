<p>We’re big fans of OpenSCAD here at Hackaday — it’s free and open source software, runs on pretty much anything, and the idea of describing objects via code seems like a natural fit for producing functional parts. Rather than clicking and dragging elements on the screen, you can knock out a quick bracket or other simple component with just a few lines of code. But one of the things we don’t often get a chance to showcase is the incredible potential of generating 2D and 3D objects algorithmically.</p>

		<p>With the release of Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift, there is a major change in the design and architecture that impacts how OpenStack is deployed and managed. The OpenStack control plane has moved from traditional standalone containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to an advanced pod-based Kubernetes managed architecture.Introducing Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShiftIn this new form factor, the OpenStack control services such as keystone, nova, glance and neutron that were once deployed as standalone containers on top of bare metal or virtual machines (VMs) are now deployed</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Registered ABE and Adaptively-Secure Broadcast Encryption from Succinct LWE</strong><br>
<em>Jeffrey Champion, Yao-Ching Hsieh, David J. Wu</em></p>
<p>Registered attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables fine-grained access control to encrypted data (like standard ABE), but without needing a central trusted authority. In a key-policy registered ABE scheme, users choose their own public and private keys and then register their public keys together with a decryption policy with an (untrusted) key curator. The key curator aggregates all of the individual public keys into a short master public key which serves as the public key for an ABE scheme.</p>

		<p><em>On March 23 I was invited to participate in a panel discussion at the European Internet Services Providers Association (EuroISPA). The focus of this discussion was on recent legislative proposals, especially the EU Commission’s new “chat control” content scanning proposal, as well as the future of encryption and fundamental rights. These are the introductory remarks I prepared.</em></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting me today.</p>
<p>I should start by making brief introduction. I am a professor of computer science and a researcher in the field of applied cryptography. On a day-to-day basis this means that I work on the design of encryption systems. Most of what I do involves building things: I design new encryption systems and try to make existing encryption technologies more useful.</p>

<p>The Display/Keyboard unit – DSKY for short – is the primary way that Apollo-era astronauts communicated with the onboard computers. Not all DSKYs ended up in space, however, with the MIT hosting a simulator that features one of these units. Unfortunately the unit that ended up at [CuriousMarc]’s lab had seen better days, with the assumption being that it was the same DSKY that was installed in a photo of the old simulator. In addition to the busted EL display and two (improper) replacement keys, the insides show signs of damaged modules and possibly worse.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Security researchers at Google (Pedro Gallegos, Simon Scannell, and Jasiel Spelman) discovered vulnerabilities in the rsync server and rsync client. The rsync server vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-12084 and CVE-2024-12085) ultimately allow remote code execution (RCE). The rsync client vulnerabilities allow a malicious server to read arbitrary files (CVE-2024-12086), create unsafe symlinks (CVE-2024-12087) and overwrite arbitrary files in certain circumstances (CVE-2024-12088).</p>
<p>During the coordinated vulnerability response of the above issues, a sixth vulnerability (CVE-2024-12747) which affects how the rsync server handles symlinks was reported by Aleksei Gorban.</p>

<p>The devastating wildfires sweeping through Southern California have left countless neighborhoods in ruins, forcing thousands to evacuate and destroying homes in their path. While many people across the nation are moved to support those affected, this goodwill often becomes a target for opportunistic cybercriminals. McAfee researchers have discovered that social media networks have been flooded with deceptive images, showing how cryptocurrencies can be used to make donations for fire relief efforts. We believe these to be scams trying to dupe consumers. McAfee CTO, Steve Grobman says, “It’s really unfortunate because it’s such a tragic event, and we’re seeing cybercriminals and scammers take advantage of the situation in a whole host of ways, from fake GoFundMe sites to fraudulent campaign donation pages.”</p>
