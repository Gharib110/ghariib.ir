<p>You probably get a few of these things each week in the mail. And some of them actually do a good job of obscuring the contents inside, even if you hold the envelope up to the light. But have you ever taken the time to appreciate the beauty of security envelope patterns? Yeah, I didn’t think so.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing is just how many different patterns are out there when a dozen or so would probably cover it. But there are so, so many patterns in the world. In my experience, many utilities and higher-end companies create their own security patterns for mailing out statements and the like, so that right there adds up to some unknown abundance.</p>

<p>At the end of a year when Texas employees were among those targeted by hackers, the state has awarded a multi-million-dollar contract to a company that works with entities to increase technological efficiency and offer cybersecurity protection. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) announced Dec. 18 that it was awarded a $170.9 million contract from the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) to provide cybersecurity services in protection of state networks.</p>

		<p>Before we ring in the New Year, SentinelOne reviews and reflects on some of the most formative cyber news stories that occurred in 2024.</p>
<p>It’s almost time to wave goodbye to the year that was 2024, and as we look ahead to 2025 and the challenges that might bring, now is a good time to reflect on the best, the worst and the ugliest cybersecurity news stories over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>We always enjoy videos from the [Mathologer], but we especially liked the recent video on the Helicone, a toy with a surprising connection to mathematics. The toy is cool all by itself, but the video shows how a sufficiently large heliocone models many “natural numbers” and acts, as [Mathologer] puts it, acts as “microscope to probe the nature of numbers.”</p>
<p>The chief number of interest is the so-called golden ratio. A virtual model of the toy allows easy experimentation and even some things that aren’t easily possible in the real world. The virtual helicone also allows you to make a crazy number of layers, which can show certain mathematical ideas that would be hard to do in a 3D print or a wooden toy.</p>

		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will reportedly arrive in April 2025, according to an accessory manufacturer.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is buzzing with the latest hardware from NVIDIA, AMD, Lenovo, and plenty of other tech giants — all of which were expected, but unexpectedly, it&rsquo;s also buzzing with news about the new Nintendo Switch that&rsquo;s slated to arrive this year. The latest being a report from Numerama (thanks, VGC) where accessory maker Genki has potentially spilled the beans that Nintendo&rsquo;s next generation of hardware will arrive sometime in April 2025.</p>

		<p>In a compelling analysis of modern enterprise platforms, former Amazon platform architect and enterprise technology veteran Gregor Hohpe challenges conventional wisdom about how organizations can balance standardization with innovation. His insights arrive at a critical moment when enterprises are grappling with unprecedented technological complexity while seeking ways to accelerate development and ensure compliance.</p>
