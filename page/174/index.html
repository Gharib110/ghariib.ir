		<p>With Cloudflare conducting media resource caching at the data center closest in proximity to its users, security researcher Daniel discovered that an information-disclosure intrusion could be conducted through the delivery of a unique image hosted on Cloudflare&rsquo;s CDN to a vulnerable app, which would use the Cloudflare Teleport tool to route the requests to certain data centers.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky enough to work from home, you’ll soon find that it presents its own set of challenges, mostly related to work/life balance. It can get so bad that you don’t know what day of the week it is. Really. Ask us how we know.</p>
<p>Rather than miss a meeting (or a day off), prolific hacker [Arnov Sharma] created this day of the week clock. It uses a customized LED driver board with seven sets of three LEDs, each driven by a MOSFET. Each MOSFET is controlled by a DFRobot Mini Beetle ESP32-C3. It runs on a 2200 mAh, 3.7 V lithium-ion battery.</p>

		<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>For years, Jira has been a go-to tool for project management, especially in software development. However, more and more agencies and startups are reconsidering their reliance on Jira. While it’s a powerful platform, many smaller teams find it overwhelming, expensive, and unnecessarily complex for their needs. In this post, we’ll dive into why agencies and startups are moving away from Jira and explore alternatives that better suit their dynamic workflows.</p>

	<b><time>23.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The worlds of user experience (UX) design and open source technology are increasingly converging. At Red Hat, where open source fuels innovation, this synergy is reshaping how designers and developers collaborate to create impactful tools and workflows. For many UX designers, including myself, the idea of stepping into technical realms like using command line interfaces (CLIs), opening an issue on GitHub, or diving into codebases can feel intimidating and out of reach. But the most impactful opportunities lie within these technical spaces. These opportunities to create new tools and workflows empower users and bridge the gap between design and development.</p>

	<b><time>23.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In programming, it’s common to come across 0, null, and undefined. These three values might seem similar at first glance, but they serve different purposes and behave differently in code. Let’s explore what each means and how they work, with simple examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-zero-0">What is Zero (0)?</h2>
<p>The value 0 represents a number, specifically the smallest non-negative number. It is a defined value and is treated as a number in JavaScript.</p>

<p>By and large, our clothes don’t actively <em>move.</em> They’re simple pieces of fabric assembled to sit nicely on our bodies, and little more. [anoukwipprecht] created something a little more technological and confronting, though, with the Robotic Open-Source Scale Dress.

<p>Right from the drop, you can see what the dress is all about. It’s an open-shoulder design that has eight large moving scales mounted on the front. These scales are printed, and each features its own servo for independent movement. The scale baseplates are designed to hide the servos themselves, creating a sleeker look that hides the mechanism underneath. Each baseplate is also perforated with holes, allowing it to be sewn on to the base garment in a stout fashion. The dress itself is created with thick neoprene fabric, enabling it to take the weight of the scale assemblies without sagging or pulling away from the body. You can even customize the scales in various ways—such as adding feathers instead.</p>
