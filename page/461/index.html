<p>AWS is aware of CVE-2024-30164 and CVE-2024-30165 in AWS Client VPN. These issues could potentially allow an actor with access to an end user&rsquo;s device to escalate to root privilege and execute arbitrary commands on that device. We addressed these issues on all platforms. Customers using AWS Client VPN should upgrade to version 3.11.1 or higher for Windows, 3.9.2 or higher for MacOS, and 3.12.1 or higher for Linux.</p>

<p>Data.all is an open source development framework to help customers build a data marketplace on AWS.</p>
<p>We have identified the following issues within data.all version 1.0.0 through 2.6.0. On November 8, 2024, we released a fix and recommend customers upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code are patched to incorporate the new fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-52311 relates to an issue where data.all does not invalidate authentication token upon user logout.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-52312 relates to an issue where data.all authenticated users can perform restricted operations against DataSets and Environments.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-52313 relates to an issue where data.all authenticated users can obtain incorrect object level authorizations.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-52314 relates to an issue where data.all admin user may access potentially sensitive data stored by producers via logs.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-10953 relates to an issue where data.all authenticated users can perform mutating update operations on persisted notification records.</li>

<p>AWS is aware of CVE-2022-1471 in SnakeYaml software, included in DynamoDB local jar and Docker distributions from version 1.21 and version 2.0. If leveraged, this issue could allow an actor to perform remote code execution using the SnakeYaml&rsquo;s Constructor(), as the software does not restrict the types that can be instantiated during deserialization. AWS has found no evidence that this issue has been leveraged, however, customers should still take action. On November 6, 2024, we released a fix for this issue. Customers should upgrade DynamoDB local to the latest version: v1.25.1 and above, or 2.5.3 and above.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>

<p>A security researcher recently reported an issue with AWS’s recently-released (November 16th, 2022) support for multiple multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices for IAM user principals. The reported issue could have potentially arisen only when the following three conditions were met: (1) An IAM user had possession of long-term access key (AK)/secret key (SK) credentials, (2) that IAM user had the privilege to add an MFA to their own identity without using an MFA, and (3) that IAM user’s overall access privileges beyond console sign-in had been configured by an administrator to be greater after adding the MFA. Under those narrow conditions, possession of AK/SK alone was equivalent to possession of AK/SK and a previously configured MFA.</p>
