	<b><time>15.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console. FortiOS is the Fortinet’s proprietary Operation System which is utilized across multiple product lines. FortiProxy is a secure web gateway that attempts to protects users against internet-borne attacks, and provides protection and visibility to the network against unauthorized access and threats. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Multiple Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Avalanche, the most severe of which could allow for authentication bypass. Ivanti Avalanche is a mobile device management system. Network security features allow one to manage wireless settings (including encryption and authentication) and apply those settings on a schedule throughout the network. Successful exploitation could allow for a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication. Depending on the privileges associated with the logged-on user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have found that bad actors are continuing to have success by spoofing sender email addresses as part of various malspam campaigns.</p>
<p>Faking the sender address of an email is widely seen as an attempt to make the digital missive more legitimate and get past security mechanisms that could otherwise flag it as malicious.</p>
<p>While there are safeguards such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) that can be used to prevent spammers from spoofing well-known domains, such measures have increasingly led them to leverage old, neglected domains in their operations.</p>

		<p>One of the most common questions I got asked during presentations and conferences is: &ldquo;<strong>During a search and seizure we found a wiped iPhone, what can we do next?</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6xIfngOuvXrGpaenivhwwqQadArE3RoQ9MynGYodzJ1SjdkoYvo1KOqbz23sL8xmL9t7IAxSgrKELQZZ6NEBRYFJu3wWr1ZxBQOW3lBtjyCq5gtrLgBKemMqluauKuC5lvteSiMW7t1Y/w296-h640/image.png" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>First and foremost: <strong>you cannot recover data stored on the device before wiping occurred</strong>.<br>
The encryption keys you need to decrypt the data are gone forever.<br>
Full stop :)</p>
<p>If you are aware of any method, technique, tool or magic box that can do that, please let me know :)</p>

		<p>Back in March I was fortunate to spend several days visiting Brussels, where I had a chance to attend a panel on “chat control“: the new content scanning regime being considered by the EU Commission. Among various requirements, this proposed legislation would mandate that <em>client-side scanning</em> technology be incorporated into encrypted text messaging applications like Signal, WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. The scanning tech would examine private messages for certain types of illicit content, including child sexual abuse media (known as CSAM), along with a broad category of textual conversations that constitute “grooming behavior.”</p>
