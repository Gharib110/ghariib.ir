Google is teaming up with the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Meta, and Opera to form a new Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers group. Members of the group, managed by the Linux Foundation, will work together, pool resources, talent, time, and expertise to improve, innovate, and accelerate development of the open-source Chromium codebase. Why the Linux Foundation? Google cites their ‚Äúlong established practices for open governance, prioritizing transparency, inclusivity, and community-driven development.‚Äù For its part, Google says it has no intention of reducing its contributions to Chromium (which made up roughly 94 percent of all commits to the codebase in 2024), but will [‚Ä¶]</p>

		<p>I was recently brushing up on my Data Structures and Algorithms skills, specifically, sorting algorithms; and I found myself in an interesting situation.</p>
<p>How do I create a random array of length <code>n</code> of values to test my sorting algorithm? You might say that&rsquo;s easy, and it truly is. In your head you probably came up with something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>function randomArray(n) {
    const arrToReturn = [];

    for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        arrToReturn.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
    }
    return arrToReturn;
}
</code></pre><p>This definitely works as intended. But I was looking for something much simpler. Preferably a one-liner. Well, the first thought that came to mind was to use <code>new Array()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="meson-build-system">Meson build system</h2>
<p>For a long time, Git could be built using either a Makefile-based build system or an Autoconf-based build system. Git developers have been using mostly the Makefile-based build system, so the Autoconf-based build system has lagged behind in features and maintenance. Another issue was that a lot of Windows developers use integrated development environments (IDEs) that don‚Äôt have good support for Makefile- and Autoconf-based build systems.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re building a custom PC, chances are you don&rsquo;t want cable clutter crowding your chassis.</p>
<p>When purchasing a new PC, you have two options: buy the parts and build your own custom PC, or get a prebuilt PC from a custom PC builder or an OEM. Either way, cable management is going to be an important factor in how good the finished custom PC looks and that can be a challenge. Things like ARGB fans introduce tons of additional cabling to the mix, as do USB hubs and other considerations. Even just handling the front panel connectors alone can be a challenge in some chassis, but with a few handy tips and some pre-planning, cable management can be tackled with a minimum of fuss.</p>

		<p>Raspberry Pi is almost always the right choice</p>
<p>If you need a small, affordable computer for a personal project you‚Äôre trying to put together, there‚Äôs never been a better time. Single-board computers comprise a $3 billion market that‚Äôs only projected to grow for the next decade. That means there are a lot of options to choose from, but unless you have a very specific need in mind, there‚Äôs one name you should consider before any others: Raspberry Pi. Yes, there are dozens of SBC makers out there, but there are tons of reasons why Raspberry Pi still stands above them all.</p>
