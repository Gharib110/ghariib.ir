<p>I thought I’d seen it all when it comes to cold call virus scammers, you know, the guys who call you up from “Windows” because they’ve had reports of viruses from your machine? I’ve recorded their audio, recorded their video, antagonised them, interviewed one of the blokes behind it, tried to tell them I was Dutch and even convinced them that I was Mick Dundee.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Secure Vault scheme in the Cloud Operating Model</strong><br>
<em>Rishiraj Bhattacharyya, Avradip Mandal, Meghna Sengupta</em></p>
<p>The rising demand for data privacy in cloud-based environments has led to the development of advanced mechanisms for securely managing sensitive information. A prominent solution in this domain is the &ldquo;Data Privacy Vault,&rdquo; a concept that is being provided commercially by companies such as Hashicorp, Basis Theory, Skyflow Inc., VGS, Evervault, Protegrity, Anonomatic, and BoxyHQ. However, no existing work has rigorously defined the security notions required for a Data Privacy Vault or proven them within a formal framework which is the focus of this paper.</p>

		<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: VT Crowdsourced Sigma rules will now also match suspicious activity for macOS and Linux binaries, in addition to Windows.</p>
<p>We recently discussed how to maximize the value of Sigma rules by easily converting them to YARA Livehunts. Unfortunately, at that time Sigma rules were only matched against Windows binaries.</p>
<p>Since then, our engineering team worked hard to provide a better experience to Sigma lovers, increasing Crowdsourced Sigma rules value by extending matches to macOS and Linux samples.</p>

		<p>As of October 2023, researchers at Bitdefender Labs have been actively keeping tabs on steam-jacking attacks against high-profile YouTube accounts used to conduct a myriad of crypto doubling scams.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of those &ldquo;your parcel couldn&rsquo;t be delivered&rdquo; phishing attacks lately and if you&rsquo;re a human with a phone, you probably have been too. Just as a brief reminder, they look like this:</p>

<p>I actually thought that once I didn’t bother connecting a landline after moving house recently, it would be the end of scam calls. I used to get them all the time – the ones where they’d call up and say you had viruses on your PC – and my recordings of those turned out to be rather popular. But today I had another call, although this one went a bit differently.</p>
