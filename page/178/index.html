<p>Online criminals are targeting individuals and businesses that advertise via Google Ads by phishing them for their credentials â€” ironically â€” via fraudulent Google ads.</p>
<p>The scheme consists of stealing as many advertiser accounts as possible by impersonating Google Ads and redirecting victims to fake login pages. We believe their goal is to resell those accounts on blackhat forums, while also keeping some to themselves to perpetuate these campaigns.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>The HHE Land: Exploring the Landscape of Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption</strong><br>
<em>Hossein Abdinasibfar, Camille Nuoskala, Antonis Michalas</em></p>
<p>Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) is considered a promising solution for key challenges that emerge when adopting Homomorphic Encryption (HE). In cases such as communication and computation overhead for clients and storage overhead for servers, it combines symmetric cryptography with HE schemes. However, despite a decade of advancements, enhancing HHE usability, performance, and security for practical applications remains a significant stake. This work contributes to the field by presenting a comprehensive analysis of prominent HHE schemes, focusing on their performance and security. We implemented three superior schemes&ndash;PASTA, HERA, and Rubato&ndash;using the Go programming language and evaluated their performance in a client-server setting. To promote open science and reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available on GitHub. Furthermore, we conducted an extensive study of applicable attacks on HHE schemes, categorizing them under algebraic-based, differential-based, linear-based, and LWE-based attacks. Our security analysis revealed that while most existing schemes meet theoretical security requirements, they remain vulnerable to practical attacks. These findings emphasize the need for improvements in practical security measures, such as defining standardized parameter sets and adopting techniques like noise addition to counter these attacks. This survey provides insights and guidance for researchers and practitioners to design and develop secure and efficient HHE systems, paving the way for broader real-world adoption.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Treating dishonest ciphertexts in post-quantum KEMs &ndash; explicit vs. implicit rejection in the FO transform</strong><br>
<em>Kathrin HÃ¶velmanns, Mikhail Kudinov</em></p>
<p>We revisit a basic building block in the endeavor to migrate to post-quantum secure cryptography, Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). KEMs enable the establishment of a shared secret key, using only public communication. When targeting chosen-ciphertext security against quantum attackers, the go-to method is to design a Public-Key Encryption (PKE) scheme and then apply a variant of the PKE-to-KEM conversion known as the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, which we revisit in this work. Intuitively, FO ensures chosen-ciphertext security by rejecting dishonest messages. This comes in two flavors &ndash; the KEM could reject by returning &rsquo;explicit&rsquo; failure symbol $bot$ or instead by returning a pseudo-random key (&lsquo;implicit&rsquo; reject). During the NIST post-quantum standardization process, designers chose implicit rejection, likely due to the availability of security proofs against quantum attackers. On the other hand, implicit rejection introduces complexity and can easily deteriorate into explicit rejection in practice. While it was proven that implicit rejection is not less secure than explicit rejection, the other direction was less clear. This is relevant because the available security proofs against quantum attackers still leave things to be desired. When envisioning future improvements, due to, e.g., advancements in quantum proof techniques, having to treat both variants separately creates unnecessary overhead. In this work, we thus re-evaluate the relationship between the two design approaches and address the so-far unexplored direction: in the classical random oracle model, we show that explicit rejection is not less secure than implicit rejection, up to a rare edge case. This, however, uses the observability of random oracle queries. To lift the proof into the quantum world, we make use of the extractable QROM (eQROM). As an alternative that works without the eQROM, we give an indirect proof that involves a new necessity statement on the involved PKE scheme.</p>

<p>AI isnâ€™t just powering innovationâ€”itâ€™s powering threats. From deepfake scams to AI-generated phishing attacks, cybercriminals are using these advanced tools to bypass traditional defenses and target organizations with alarming precision. While many businesses are scrambling to address these risks, most are underestimating the scale, complexity, and urgency of the challenge.</p>
