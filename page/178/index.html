Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS is scheduled for release on February 13th – in time for Valentines Day, aww. Canonical’s Florent Jacquet shares the date on the Ubuntu Developer mailing list today along with a note to developers to be mindful of their package uploads to noble in the coming weeks. As a result, if you’re using the latest long-term support release you may notice a slightly drop-off in the number of non-essential updates Software Updater bugs you to install between now and February 13. This allow devs to create a snapshot and test it properly. Ubuntu point releases rarely deliver new […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Unveiling Privacy Risks in Quantum Optimization Services</strong><br>
<em>Mateusz Leśniak, Michał Wroński, Ewa Syta, Mirosław Kutyłowski</em></p>
<p>As cloud-based quantum computing services, such as those offered by D-Wave, become more popular for practical applications, privacy-preserving methods (such as obfuscation) are essential to address data security, privacy, and legal compliance concerns. Several efficient obfuscation methods have been proposed, which do not increase the time complexity of solving the obfuscated problem, for quantum optimization problems. These include {em sign reversing}, {em variable permutation}, and the combination of both methods assumed to provide greater protection. Unfortunately, sign reversing has already been shown to be insecure.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 24, 2025</p>
<p>With the financial toll of cybersecurity incidents expected to reach $10.5 trillion by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, the need for robust cyber resilience has never been more urgent.</p>
<p>Cyber resilience can be best achieved by addressing gaps in emerging and niche technologies, such as machine learning security and operational technology security, which are often underinvested in and diversifying technology stacks to eliminate single points of failure, posits a trio of thought leaders in a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) story.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Verification-efficient Homomorphic Signatures for Verifiable Computation over Data Streams</strong><br>
<em>Gaspard Anthoine, Daniele Cozzo, Dario Fiore</em></p>
<p>Homomorphic signatures for NP (HSNP) allow proving that a signed value is the result of a non-deterministic computation on signed inputs. At CCS'22, Fiore and Tucker introduced HSNP, showed how to use them for verifying arbitrary computations on data streams, and proposed a generic HSNP construction obtained by efficiently combining zkSNARKs with linearly homomorphic signatures (LHS), namely those supporting linear functions. Their proposed LHS however suffered from an high verification cost. In this work we propose an efficient LHS that significantly improves on previous work in terms of verification time. Using the modular approach of Fiore and Tucker, this yields a verifier-efficient HSNP. We show that the HSNP instantiated with our LHS is particularly suited to the case when the data is taken from consecutive samples, which captures important use cases including sliding window statistics such as variances, histograms and stock market predictions.</p>

Vivaldi web browser has just released its first major update of the year – a corker it is, too! Fans of the Chromium-based browser—though Vivaldi Technologies doesn’t appear to be part of the new Linux Foundation-led Supporters of Chromium Browsers project—will discover a bunch of improvements to the Dashboard feature Vivaldi 7.0 delivered. A new weather widget can be added to see current conditions and hourly and weekly weather forecasts for custom locations, plus the ability to set a preferred temperate, precipitation and wind speed unit (celsius, mm, and mph ftw). Keeping things scandi-cool, the Norway-based browser makes use of […]</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re heading back to London! And making a trip to Reykjavik. And Dublin. I talked about us considering this in the video yesterday, and just before publishing this post, we pulled the trigger and booked the tickets. The plan is to pretty much repeat the US and Canada trip we did in September and spend the time meeting up with some of the law enforcement agencies and various other organisations we&rsquo;ve been working with over the years. As I say in the video, if you&rsquo;re in one of these locations and are in a position to stand up a meetup or user group session, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. Europe is a hell of a long way to go so we do want to make the most of the travel, stand by for more plans as they emerge.</p>

		<p>Every click, swipe, or pause we make online is tracked, often through pixel tracking. This tracking is used by advertisers, big tech, and even political groups to monitor your email activity (often without you knowing). Also referred to as web beacons or tracking pixels, these embedded spies collect your personal data: such as your device type, your location, and interaction behavior with the email. Let’s take an in-depth look at what tracking pixels are, why they’re used, how to spot email trackers, and lastly how you can stop pixel tracking by using email providers with automatic tracking protection like Tuta Mail.</p>

		<p>I am working on a AI model that have a few files larger than 10MiB of trained model. While pushing those models to huggingface repository I got an error saying the files are too large to upload. Hugging Face has a size limit for single files, and files larger than 10MiB need special handling. This means I need to change the way I upload or store these files.</p>
<p>This article will help you understand why this error happens and how you can fix it. You will learn how to push large files to a Hugging Face repository step by step.</p>
