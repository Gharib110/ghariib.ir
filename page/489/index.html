		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox is a web browser used to access the Internet.</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox ESR is a version of the web browser intended to be deployed in large organizations.</li>
<li>Mozilla Thunderbird is an email client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
