<p>Allan Pinkerton (Alexander Gardnerâ€Šâ€”â€ŠLibrary of Congress)</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At the onset of the Civil War, a man whose name would eventually become synonymous with famous American detectives was reportedly providing false reports to the Unionâ€™s top general. Allan Pinkerton, who once successfully smuggled Abraham Lincoln into Washington, D.C. to avoid a rumored assassination attempt before he was even sworn in as president, acted as General George McClellanâ€™s top intelligence officer. He was considered one of the best spymasters in the United States, responsible for effectively founding the nationâ€™s first secretÂ service.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Cloudflare Radar celebrated its fourth birthday in September 2024. As weâ€™ve expanded Radarâ€™s scope over the last four years, the value that it provides as a resource for the <strong>global</strong> Internet has grown over time, and with Radar data and graphs often appearing in publications and social media around the world, we knew that we needed to make it available in languages beyond English.</p>
<p>Localization is important because most Internet users do not speak English as a first language. According to W3Techs, English usage on the Internet has dropped 8.3 points (57.7% to 49.4%) since January 2023, whereas usage of other languages like Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch is steadily increasing. Furthermore, a CSA Research study determined that 65% of Internet users prefer content in their language.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Weâ€™re pleased to announce an enhanced version of the AWS Secrets Manager transform: <code>AWS::SecretsManager-2024-09-16</code>.Â This update is designed to simplify infrastructure management by reducing the need for manual security updates, bug fixes, and runtime upgrades.</p>
<p>AWS Secrets ManagerÂ helps you manage, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycles. Some AWS services offer managed rotation of secrets, but for other secrets, you perform rotation by using an AWS Lambda function that updates your secret and the database or service.</p>
