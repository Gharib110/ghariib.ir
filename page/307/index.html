<p>Imagine you wanted to buy some shit on the internet. Not the metaphorical kind in terms of &ldquo;I bought some random shit online&rdquo;, but literal shit. Turds. Faeces. The kind of thing you never would have thought possible to buy online until&hellip; Shitexpress came along. Here&rsquo;s a service that enables you to send <em>an actual piece of smelly shit</em> to &ldquo;An irritating colleague. School teacher. Your ex-wife. Filthy boss. Jealous neighbour. That successful former classmate. Or all those pesky haters.&rdquo; But it would be weird if the intended recipient of the aforementioned shit knew it came from you, so, Shitexpress makes a bold commitment:</p>

<p>I thought I’d seen it all when it comes to cold call virus scammers, you know, the guys who call you up from “Windows” because they’ve had reports of viruses from your machine? I’ve recorded their audio, recorded their video, antagonised them, interviewed one of the blokes behind it, tried to tell them I was Dutch and even convinced them that I was Mick Dundee.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Secure Vault scheme in the Cloud Operating Model</strong><br>
<em>Rishiraj Bhattacharyya, Avradip Mandal, Meghna Sengupta</em></p>
<p>The rising demand for data privacy in cloud-based environments has led to the development of advanced mechanisms for securely managing sensitive information. A prominent solution in this domain is the &ldquo;Data Privacy Vault,&rdquo; a concept that is being provided commercially by companies such as Hashicorp, Basis Theory, Skyflow Inc., VGS, Evervault, Protegrity, Anonomatic, and BoxyHQ. However, no existing work has rigorously defined the security notions required for a Data Privacy Vault or proven them within a formal framework which is the focus of this paper.</p>

		<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: VT Crowdsourced Sigma rules will now also match suspicious activity for macOS and Linux binaries, in addition to Windows.</p>
<p>We recently discussed how to maximize the value of Sigma rules by easily converting them to YARA Livehunts. Unfortunately, at that time Sigma rules were only matched against Windows binaries.</p>
<p>Since then, our engineering team worked hard to provide a better experience to Sigma lovers, increasing Crowdsourced Sigma rules value by extending matches to macOS and Linux samples.</p>
