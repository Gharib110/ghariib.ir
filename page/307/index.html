		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Round-Optimal Compiler for Semi-Honest to Malicious Oblivious Transfer via CIH</strong><br>
<em>Varun Madathil, Alessandra Scafuro, Tanner Verber</em></p>
<p>A central question in the theory of cryptography is whether we can build protocols that achieve stronger security guarantees, e.g., security against malicious adversaries, by combining building blocks that achieve much weaker security guarantees, e.g., security only against semi-honest adversaries; and with the minimal number of rounds. An additional focus is whether these building blocks can be used only as a black-box. Since Oblivious Transfer (OT) is the necessary and sufficient building block to securely realize any two-party (and multi-party) functionality, theoreticians often focus on proving whether maliciously secure OT can be built from a weaker notion of OT.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Scalable Post-Quantum Oblivious Transfers for Resource-Constrained Receivers</strong><br>
<em>Aydin Abadi, Yvo Desmedt</em></p>
<p>It is imperative to modernize traditional core cryptographic primitives, such as Oblivious Transfer (OT), to address the demands of the new digital era, where privacy-preserving computations are executed on low-power devices. This modernization is not merely an enhancement but a necessity to ensure security, efficiency, and continued relevance in an ever-evolving technological landscape.</p>
<p>This work introduces two scalable OT schemes: (1) Helix OT, a $1$-out-of-$n$ OT, and (2) Priority OT, a $t$-out-of-$n$ OT. Both schemes provide unconditional security, ensuring resilience against quantum adversaries. Helix OT achieves a receiver-side download complexity of $O(1)$. In big data scenarios, where certain data may be more urgent or valuable, we propose Priority OT. With a receiver-side download complexity of $O(t)$, this scheme allows data to be received based on specified priorities. By prioritizing data transmission, Priority OT ensures that the most important data is received first, optimizing bandwidth, storage, and processing resources. Performance evaluations indicate that Helix OT completes the transfer of 1 out of $n=$ 16,777,216 messages in 9 seconds, and Priority OT handles $t=$ 1,048,576 out of $n$ selections in 30 seconds. Both outperform existing $t$-out-of-$n$ OTs (when $tgeq 1$), underscoring their suitability for large-scale applications. To the best of our knowledge, Helix OT and Priority OT introduce unique advancements that distinguish them from previous schemes.</p>

<p>This tutorial shows how to search and print which files contain your specified text or string in Ubuntu and other Linux in command line, with examples.</p>
<p>Search file or file content is an important skill for Linux administrator. I’ve shown how to use locate command to search files through the keyword in its file-name, path, and file type.</p>
<p>Here I’m going to show you how to search files if you know any text or string they contain.</p>

		<p>Securing an event of the magnitude of AWS re:Invent—the Amazon Web Services annual conference in Las Vegas—is no small feat. The most recent event, in December, operated on the scale of a small city, spanning seven venues over twelve miles and nearly seven million square feet across the bustling Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Keeping all 60,000 in-person attendees, 400,000 online participants, and their data secure requires a sophisticated blend of physical and logical security measures—a challenge that we’ve addressed by building an integrated security strategy that brings both sides together. We used every resource available to us, including drones, K9 units, our network security teams, and much more, to help protect every person attending the event and their data.</p>

<p>Here we are a quarter of the way through the 21st century and the rate of change in technology shows no signs of slowing. And, while we are not quite the jet-setting hipsters that cartoons of the 1960’s predicted, we are living in a world where everything and everyone is connected. We all want our technology to work seamlessly, frictionless, and securely.</p>

<p>Sheet metal is very easy to form, including the pressing in of intricate shapes with dies and a hydraulic press, but the dies themselves are slightly harder to come by. What if we could 3D print custom dies to stamp logos and more into sheet metal? This is the premise of a recent video by the <em>Stick Shift Garage</em> channel on YouTube in which dies are printed in PLA+ (solid infill) and used to stamp 1 and 2 mm thick sheet metal with the channel’s logo.</p>

		<p>What is Space Bears? Space Bear is a relatively new ransomware group that first appeared on the radar in April 2024. The gang, which is aligned to the Phobos ransomware-as-a-service group, steals sensitive data from organisations, encrypts victims&rsquo; computer systems, and demands that a ransom be paid for a decryption key or the data will be published on the dark web. So far, so normal. What makes Space Bears noteworthy? Space Bears has gained a certain amount of notoriety by the way in which it presents itself. Unlike other ransomware gangs, Space Bears presents a very &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; image of&hellip;</p>

		<p>By using Python libraries in Excel, you can automate tasks, build dashboards, and more.</p>
<p>While Excel is a powerful tool for data management and analysis, it often feels limited when dealing with complex data transformations, large datasets, and repetitive tasks. Here is where Python comes into play. By integrating Python libraries into your workflow, you can unlock its true potential.</p>
