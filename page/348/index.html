		<p>Security information and event management, SIEM for short, is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations.</p>
<p>SIEM, pronounced “sim,” combines both security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into one security management system. SIEM technology collects event log data from a range of sources, identifies activity that deviates from the norm with real-time analysis, and takes appropriate action.</p>

		<p>A portion of the internet known as the “dark web” cannot be found by search engines and must be accessed through the use of the anonymizing browser Tor.</p>
<p>A portion of the internet known as the “dark web” is not indexed by search engines. You’ve likely heard of the “dark web” being a hub for illegal activity, and this is true. After classifying the contents of 2,723 active dark web sites over five weeks in 2015, researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid of King’s College in London discovered that 57% of them hosted illegal content. </p>

		<p>Today’s workforce is more distributed than ever. Globally, 16% of companies are fully remote, while 40% have a hybrid arrangement. </p>
<p>As workforces become increasingly distributed, security leaders face many challenges. They must monitor potential malicious activity across a wide array of devices scattered throughout the entire network. With the rise of endpoint monitoring tools, it has become easier to monitor devices. But challenges remain.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll go over everything you need to know about endpoint monitoring to improve your organization’s security posture.</p>

		<p>As quantum computing leapfrogs at great speed, the spotlight is now on post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Recently, NIST released the first three PQC encryption algorithm standards, urging organizations to test the new algorithms and prepare their cryptographic infrastructures for the inevitable shift to quantum-resistant methods. This push for PQC readiness is driven by a growing concern […]</p>

		<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>WhatApp for Android retains contact info locally after contacts get deleted. This would allow an attacker with physical access to the device to check if the WhatsApp user had interactions with specific contacts, even though they have been deleted.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<p>When a contact is deleted on WhatsApp, their information about security code changes is retained (while the chat content is not). The only way to get rid of that is to select “Clear Chat” for the contact before deleting it. Even deleting the chat itself doesn’t do it unless the “Clear Chat” operation is done first. The “security code change notifications” option must be enabled in order for this to work.</p>

		<p>Facebook-owned social media platforms, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram are facing a worldwide outage, according to Downdetector, which offers real-time status and outage information for all kinds of services.</p>
<p>.https://d-31038805491725975734.ampproject.net/2109102127000/frame.html</p>
<p>Downdetector showed that WhatsApp outage was reported at 8:23 pm (Pakistan Standard Time) and it shot up to 1,082 complaints by 8:38 pm.</p>
<p>The website mentioned that the Instagram outage was reported first at 7:59 pm, while Facebook went down almost around the same time.</p>

		<p>When it comes to insider threats and cybersecurity in general, experts often discuss how to practice policies of containment, and use these to mitigate threats. One fundamental way to do this is through the process of network segmentation. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-network-segmentation">What is network segmentation?</h2>
<p>Network segmentation means that you essentially create smaller subnetworks linked to each other, so that you structure your network better, for a few key benefits. First, it’s easier to see network activity and monitor it within these smaller systems. Second, it can enhance performance across the network. Third, it promotes the use of a zero trust strategy.</p>

		<p>Well before arriving on campus, Peninah (Nina) Levine knew what she wanted from her undergraduate education:</p>
<p>“I came to MIT to be in an environment that would push me beyond my comfortable limits,” says Levine, a senior majoring in nuclear science and engineering (NSE). “I had to find where my passions lay and forge my own path.”</p>
<p>Today, Levine is well along that path, engaged in a five-year combined undergraduate and master’s program and helping develop technologies for characterizing nuclear material — tools to aid in nuclear weapons verification or to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear material. Her research is based in the Laboratory for Applied Nuclear Physics, directed by Associate Professor Areg Danagoulian.</p>
