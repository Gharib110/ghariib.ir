		<p>Heutzutage wird das Active Directory (AD) von Angreifern sehr hÃ¤ufig ins Visier genommen, denn es ist eine Art GeneralschlÃ¼ssel, der den Zugang zum gesamten Netzwerk ermÃ¶glicht. AD stellt die Verzeichnisdienste bereit, mit denen Administratoren im gesamten Netzwerk Berechtigungen verwalten und Zugriff auf Ressourcen gewÃ¤hren. Es ist somit fÃ¼r die tÃ¤glichen AblÃ¤ufe eines Unternehmens unverzichtbarÂ â€“ und [â€¦]</p>

		<p>From the apps on our smartphones to chatbot assistant services, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our lives in both big and small ways. But as exciting as AI can be, itâ€™s also important to understand its potential risks. October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, making it the perfect time to become more cyber-savvy about AI. Letâ€™s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>AI is a technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. In everyday life, AI is behind many of the technologies we use. It powers recommendations on streaming TV services like Netflix, improves photo quality on your smartphone, and even aids in driving cars. AI is like having a smart assistant that can process information quickly, automate daily tasks, and make technology more intuitive.</p>

		<p>The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), a prominent national association for amateur radio enthusiasts, recently confirmed that it paid a staggering $1 million ransom to cybercriminals.</p>
<h2 id="arrl-hit-by-cyber-attack">ARRL Hit by Cyber Attack</h2>
<p>ARRL found itself at the mercy of a sophisticated ransomware attack. Upon realizing the severity of the attack, the ARRL was left with limited options. The decision to pay the $1 million ransom was not made lightly, but it was deemed necessary to regain access to critical data and ensure the organizationâ€™s continued operation. The move, while effective in recovering data, raises ethical and practical concerns about the long-term implications of complying with ransom demands.</p>

		<p>In the final quarter of 2022, the infostealer malware, Rhadamanthys, was found. Given that it could target browser extensions and wallet clients installed on the victimâ€™s computer, its capabilities demonstrated a particular interest in cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>The primary means of distribution for this threat that have been noticed are phishing emails and phony software websites that are advertised through Google Ads, regardless of the vertical or region.</p>
<p>Although its distribution and information theft methods have been observed previously, its downloader component makes it stand out. It analyzes by conventional security methods extremely difficult by combining sophisticated anti-analysis techniques with heavy obfuscation.</p>

		<p>Automation of the web is now an indispensable tool in modern software development and testing. In this comprehensive Selenium Python tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to build a robust web automation framework capable of handling real-world scenarios. If you are interested in implementing automated testing in Python or creating complex web scraping automation solutions, this guide will give you industry-tested approaches and Selenium best practices.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-web-automation-fundamentals">Understanding Web Automation Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Web automation is vital in modern software development, testing, and data collection. Its applications span from end-to-end testing of web applications to simplifying repetitive workflows, such as form submissions or web scraping. While Selenium WebDriver Python integration offers powerful capabilities, robust web automation is more than just writing scripts to mimic user interactions. Itâ€™s about designing workflows and frameworks that are maintainable, adaptable, and resilient to changes to the target web application.</p>
