		<p>There were several new releases focusing on automation in 2024, which is just one sign that automation is now officially mission critical. With IT systems and networks more complex than ever, it’s unreasonable and unreliable to try to manage important settings manually. It’s time to embrace and implement automation in 2025. To help, here are the top 10 articles we published last year on the topic of automation.1. Complexity, AI and more: Why automation is now mission-criticalIn this article, author Cindy Russell references a recent IDC study commissioned by Red Hat, which revealed that “</p>

<p>McAfee Total Protection users can feel even more secure online knowing that AV-Comparatives has named it the best in 2024 for both real-world protection and overall speed.</p>
<p>The two awards – the <strong>2024 Real-World Protection Gold Award</strong> and the <strong>Best Overall Speed Gold Award</strong> – underscore McAfee’s commitment to providing powerful security without compromising PC performance, a critical combination at a time <strong>when 59% of people globally report falling victim to an online scam</strong> or knowing someone who has, <strong>with 87% of these individuals losing money</strong>—an astounding average loss of $1,366 USD.</p>

		<p>The consequences of a wave of credit card skimmers—which is normal around the holidays—are starting to show.</p>
<p>Label maker Avery has filed a data breach notification, saying 61,193 people may have had their credit card details stolen.</p>
<p>On December 9, Avery said it became aware of an attack on its systems. An investigation showed that cybercriminals had inserted malicious software that was used to “scrape” credit card information used on its website. This credit card skimmer was active between July 18, 2024, and December 9, 2024.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Beyond Optimal Fault-Tolerance</strong><br>
<em>Andrew Lewis-Pye, Tim Roughgarden</em></p>
<p>One of the most basic properties of a consensus protocol is its fault-tolerance&ndash;the maximum fraction of faulty participants that the protocol can tolerate without losing fundamental guarantees such as safety and liveness. Because of its importance, the optimal fault-tolerance achievable by any protocol has been characterized in a wide range of settings. For example, for state machine replication (SMR) protocols operating in the partially synchronous setting, it is possible to simultaneously guarantee consistency against $alpha$-bounded adversaries (i.e., adversaries that control less than an $alpha$ fraction of the participants) and liveness against $beta$-bounded adversaries if and only if $alpha + 2beta leq 1$.</p>

<p>The Strandbeest is a walking machine, a creation of the celebrated artist Theo Jansen. They can look intimidating in their complexity, but it’s quite possible to build your own. In fact, if you’ve got a 3D-printer, it can be remarkably straightforward, as [Maker 101] demonstrates.</p>
<p>The build relies on an Arduino Uno as the brains. It’s equipped with an L293D motor driver shield to run two DC gear motors which drive the walking assemblies. Power is courtesy of a 3-cell lithium-polymer battery. The chassis, legs, and joints are all 3D-printed, and rather attractively in complimentary colors, we might add.</p>

<p><em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> was a paradigm-shifting piece of software, using raycasting techniques to create a game with pseudo-3D graphics. Now, [izabera] has done something very similar, creating a raycasting display engine that runs entirely within bash.</p>
<p>The work was developed with an eye cast over an existing raycasting tutorial online. As you might imagine, implementing these graphical techniques in a text console proved difficult. The biggest problem [izabera] encountered was that bash is slow. It’s not supposed to display full frames of moving content at 25+ fps. It’s supposed to display text. Making it display graphics by using tons of colorful characters is really pushing the limits. Bash also doesn’t have any ability to work with floating points, so all the calculations are done with massive integers. Other problems involved the limited ways to read the keyboard in bash, and keeping track of the display as a whole.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>CAPSS: A Framework for SNARK-Friendly Post-Quantum Signatures</strong><br>
<em>Thibauld Feneuil, Matthieu Rivain</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we present a general framework for constructing SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature schemes based on minimal assumptions, specifically the security of an arithmetization-oriented family of permutations. The term &ldquo;SNARK-friendly&rdquo; here refers to the efficiency of the signature verification process in terms of SNARK constraints, such as R1CS or AIR constraints used in STARKs. Within the CAPSS framework, signature schemes are designed as proofs of knowledge of a secret preimage of a one-way function, where the one-way function is derived from the chosen permutation family. To obtain compact signatures with SNARK-friendly verification, our primary goal is to achieve a hash-based proof system that is efficient in both proof size and arithmetization of the verification process.</p>
