<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 7, 2025</p>
<p>Data science technology is about to revolutionize even the most traditional industries as it uses AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data, according to a story in Medium.</p>
<p>Total global data storage is projected to exceed 200 zettabytes by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. This includes data stored on private and public IT infrastructures, on utility infrastructures, on private and public cloud data centers, and personal computing devices; PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and IoT devices</p>

		<p>One of the best things about working in quantum computing is being exposed to a whole new set of skills and tools. For those of us coming from the software engineering side, discovering the things our academic peers are using is an interesting experience. One of the best for me personally was coming across the Julia programming language, and learning why it has become the go-to language for serious scientific programming in some circles.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 23, 2024</p>
<p>Cyberattacks are as old as the internet, but over the past several years they have become more insidious and destructive, in part by harnessing social engineering at scale and deploying increasingly sophisticated technology like generative AI. This year, cybercrime is projected to cost an estimated $9.5 trillion across the globe, according to Cybersecurity Ventures — approximately 9 percent of the world’s GDP.</p>

		<p>One of the best ways to make sure your web apps work well in different environments is to containerize them. Containers let you work in a more controlled way, which makes development and deployment easier. This guide will show you how to containerize a Django web app with Docker and explain why it’s a good idea.</p>
<p>We will walk through creating a Docker container for your Django application. Docker gives you a standardized environment, which makes it easier to get up and running and more productive. This tutorial is aimed at those new to Docker who already have some experience with Django. Let’s get started!</p>

		<p>If you made a mistake in an email and need to recall it, see how to unsend an email in Outlook.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why someone may want to recall an email, whether it&rsquo;s a simple mistake, the wrong recipient, or something more serious, like leaking confidential data. Fortunately, Microsoft Outlook users need not fret on such an occasion as Outlook has a built-in and easy-to-use recall feature to help unsend emails. However, there are caveats to the process, so it is important to consider a few factors before taking advantage of this feature.</p>
