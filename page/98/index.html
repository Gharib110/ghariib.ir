	<div>
		<p>The cyber threat to critical infrastructure has never been greater. The growing sophistication of cybercriminals, deteriorating geopolitical relations, and the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) have created unprecedented risks for critical infrastructure organizations. Fortunately, resources are available to help these organizations protect themselves. In late October 2024, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) released Zero Trust Guidance for Critical Infrastructure, a systematic, five-step roadmap to help the world&rsquo;s most important organizations&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="what-is-docker-bake">What is Docker Bake?</h2>
<p>Docker Bake is an orchestration tool that streamlines Docker builds, similar to how Compose simplifies managing runtime environments. With Bake, you can define build stages and deployment environments in a declarative file, making complex builds easier to manage. It also leverages BuildKit’s parallelization and optimization features to speed up build times.</p>

		<p>At Docker, we’re committed to simplifying the developer experience and empowering enterprises to scale securely and efficiently. With the Docker Desktop 4.38 release, teams can look forward to improved developer productivity and enterprise governance. </p>
<p>We’re excited to announce the General Availability of Bake, a powerful feature for optimizing build performance and multi-node Kubernetes testing to help teams “shift left.” We’re also expanding availability for several enterprise features designed to boost operational efficiency. And last but not least, Docker AI Agent (formerly Project: Agent Gordon) is now in Beta, delivering intelligent, real-time Docker-related suggestions across Docker CLI, Desktop, and Hub. It’s here to help developers navigate Docker concepts, fix errors, and boost productivity.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, precision medicine stands as a beacon of hope, promising tailored treatments that cater to our unique genetic makeup. Yet, despite its potential, many individuals find themselves grappling with the complexities surrounding polygenic risk scores (PRS) — powerful tools designed to predict disease susceptibility based on multiple genetic factors. Are you one of those who feel overwhelmed by medical jargon or unsure about how these scores could impact your health journey? You’re not alone; countless patients and practitioners alike face significant barriers in understanding and implementing PRS effectively. This blog post aims to demystify polygenic risk scores while addressing common challenges such as accessibility, education gaps, and ethical considerations that hinder their widespread use. Through insightful case studies showcasing successful applications of PRS and a forward-looking perspective on future advancements in this field, we will explore how you can harness these insights for better health outcomes. Join us as we unlock the door to precision medicine together—your pathway to informed decisions awaits!</p>
