<p>If someone tells you, &ldquo;Don‚Äôt worry, my website is secure,&rdquo; then you‚Äôre not paranoid enough‚Äîthis guide is for you. As scammers and hackers become increasingly sophisticated, securing your WordPress website is more critical than ever. Below, I‚Äôve compiled a practical guide to help you mitigate common WordPress vulnerabilities and exploits.</p>
<h2 id="1-use-secure-and-maintained-wordpress-themes">1. Use Secure and Maintained WordPress Themes</h2>
<h3 id="avoid-stolen-plugins-or-themes">Avoid Stolen Plugins or Themes</h3>
<p>Never use pirated or unsupported themes or plugins‚Äîthey‚Äôre often compromised. Avoid one-off sales for plugins if they don‚Äôt offer ongoing support.</p>

		<p>Learn how specially crafted artifacts can be used to attack Maven repository managers. This post describes PoC exploits that can lead to pre-auth remote code execution and poisoning of the local artifacts in Sonatype Nexus and JFrog Artifactory.</p>
<p>The post Attacks on Maven proxy repositories appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>As someone who‚Äôs been breaking the security of Java applications for many years, I was always curious about the supply chain attacks on Java libraries. In 2019, I accidentally discovered an arbitrary file read vulnerability on search.maven.org, a website that is closely tied to the Maven Central Repository. Maven Central is a place where most of the Java libraries are downloaded from and its security is paramount for all companies who develop in Java. If someone is able to infiltrate Maven Central and replace a popular library, they can get the key to the whole kingdom, as almost every large tech company uses Java.</p>

<p>Back in November we first brought you word of a slicing technique by which the final strength of 3D printed parts could be considerably improved by adjusting the first layer height of each wall so that subsequent layers would interlock like bricks. It was relatively easy to implement, didn‚Äôt require anything special on the printer to accomplish, and testing showed it was effective enough to pursue further. Unfortunately, there was some patent concerns, and it seemed like nobody wanted to be the first to step up and actually implement the feature.</p>

		<p>Spanish version ¬ª</p>
<p>The Spanish National Cryptologic Center (CCN) has published a new STIC guide (CCN-STIC-887 Anexo A) that provides a comprehensive template and supporting artifacts for implementing landing zones that comply with Spain‚Äôs National Security Framework (ENS) Royal Decree 311/2022 using the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS. Spain‚Äôs ENS establishes a common framework of basic principles and requirements of security for Spanish public sector organizations and their service providers, including supply chain providers. Over the years, the collaboration between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the CCN has resulted in the publication of eight secure configuration guides (Series STIC 887) that provide comprehensive advice on the configuration of AWS services to align with the ENS. The guide CCN-STIC-887 Anexo A is the last addition to this series.</p>
