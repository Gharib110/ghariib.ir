		<p>Cybercriminals are spreading a stealer disguised as a &ldquo;cheat manager&rdquo; via YouTube videos to steal login credentials. Get the lowdown!</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, our experts discovered a new stealer called Arcane, which collects a wide range of data from infected devices. Now cybercriminals have taken it a step further by releasing ArcanaLoader — a downloader that claims to install cheats, cracks, and other “useful” gaming tools, but which actually infects devices with the Arcane stealer. Despite their lack of creativity in naming the loader, their distribution scheme is actually quite original.</p>

<p>A new ransomware operator named ‘Mora_001’ is exploiting two Fortinet vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to firewall appliances and deploy a custom ransomware strain dubbed SuperBlack.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities, both authentication bypasses, are CVE-2024–55591 and CVE-2025–24472, which Fortinet disclosed in January and February, respectively.</p>
<p>When Fortinet first disclosed CVE-2024–55591 on January 14, they confirmed it had been exploited as a zero-day, with Arctic Wolf stating it had been used in attacks since November 2024 to breach FortiGate firewalls.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Microsoft Threat Intelligence has uncovered a new variant of XCSSET, a sophisticated modular macOS malware that infects Xcode projects, in the wild during routine threat hunting. Its first known variant since 2022, this latest XCSSET malware features enhanced obfuscation methods, updated persistence mechanisms, and new infection strategies. These enhanced features help this malware family steal and exfiltrate files and system and user information, such as digital wallet data and notes, among others.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the <em>default</em>.)</p>
<h2 id="why-nftables-part-1-data-plane-latency">Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latency</h2>
<p>The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.</p>
