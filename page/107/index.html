<p>One of the major limitations of 3D printers is the size of the printable area. The robotic arm holding the printer head can only print where it can reach, after all. Some methods of reducing this constraint have been tried before, largely focusing on either larger printers or printer heads that are mobile in some way. Another approach to increasing the size of prints beyond the confined space typical of most consumer-grade 3D printers is to create some sort of joinery into the prints themselves so that larger things can be created. [Cal Bryant] is developing this jigsaw-based method which has allowed him to produce some truly massive prints.</p>

		<p>A little bit of ingenuity (and some Lego) can go a long way.</p>
<p>You know, when it comes to DIY projects, we like to see ideas that use 3D printers and pre-bought materials that get the job done. However, when we do, we lose sight of the <em>real</em> foundation of DIY fans everywhere: Lego blocks. If you&rsquo;re tired of telling yourself that your electronic projects can&rsquo;t use colorful building blocks to house them, then check out this cool example that uses Lego to get the job done.</p>

<p>With the slow demise of physical media the past years, companies are gradually closing shop on producing everything from the physical media itself to their players and recorders. For Sony this seems to have now escalated to where it’ll be shuttering its recordable optical media storage operations, after more than 18 years of producing recordable Blu-ray discs. As noted by [Toms Hardware] this also includes minidisc (MD) media and MiniDV cassettes.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Subnetting is a crucial networking technique that divides a large network (IP address range) into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. This improves network efficiency, security, and scalability. Instead of a single, large broadcast domain, subnetting allows for multiple smaller ones, reducing broadcast traffic and enhancing performance.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<p>Understanding IP addressing (IPv4 and its classful/classless addressing), binary number systems, and basic networking concepts is essential before delving into subnetting. Familiarity with subnet masks is also crucial.</p>

<p>In this paper, we show that subset sum problem consists on finding a solution over $mathbb{N}_2$ of equation $n = textbf{A}X bullet U$ where A and n are given matrix and integer and U = $[(2^0) (2^1) &hellip;. (2^{d-2}) (2^{d-1})]$. We show that it can be subdivized into 2 solvable subproblems.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Technology-Dependent Synthesis and Optimization of Circuits for Small S-boxes</strong><br>
<em>Zihao Wei, Siwei Sun, Fengmei Liu, Lei Hu, Zhiyu Zhang</em></p>
<p>Boolean formula minimization is a notoriously hard problem that is known to be $varSigma_2^P$-complete. Circuit minimization, typically studied in the context of a much broader subject known as synthesis and optimization of circuits, introduces another layer of complexity since ultimately those technology-independent epresentations (e.g., Boolean formulas and truth tables) has to be transformed into a netlist of cells of the target technology library. To manage those complexities, the industrial community typically separates the synthesis process into two steps: technology-independent optimization and technology mapping. In each step, this approach only tries to find the local optimal solution and relies heavily on heuristics rather than a systematic search. However, for small S-boxes, a more systematic exploration of the design space is possible. Aiming at the global optimum, we propose a method which can synthesize a truth table for a small S-box directly into a netlist of the cells of a given technology library. Compared with existing technology-dependent synthesis tools like LIGHTER and PEIGEN, our method produces improved results for many S-boxes with respect to circuit area. In particular, by applying our method to the $mathbb{F}_{2^4}$-inverter involved in the tower field implementation of the AES S-box, we obtain the currently known lightest implementation of the AES S-box. The search framework can be tweaked to take circuit delay into account. As a result, we find implementations for certain S-boxes with both latency and area improved.</p>

<p>Threat actors on X are exploiting the news around Ross Ulbricht to direct unsuspecting users to a Telegram channel that tricks them into run PowerShell code that infects them with malware.</p>
<p>The attack, spotted by vx-underground, is a new variant of the “Click-Fix” tactic that has become very popular among threat actors to distribute malware over the past year.</p>
<p>However, instead of being fixes for common errors, this variant pretends to be a captcha or verification system that users must run to join the channel.</p>

		<p>The Texas Attorney General’s Office has started an investigation into how Ford, Hyundai, Toyota, and Fiat Chrysler collect, share, and sell consumer data, expanding an earlier probe launched last year into how modern automakers are potentially using customer driving data.</p>
<p>We’ve addressed cars and privacy at some length on Malwarebytes Labs and came to the conclusion—with the help of many experts in the field—that modern cars simply aren’t very good at it. Many politicians in the US agree with that point of view, too, as US senators have asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate car makers’ privacy practices.</p>

<p>2024 saw an escalation in cyber attacks on the critical Education Sector. Looking at overall numbers, cyber attacks are surging at an alarming rate, with organizations experiencing an average of 1,673 weekly attacks in 2024—a staggering 44% increase from the previous year, according to Check Point’s The State of Cyber Security 2025 report. Out of all sectors, the education sector has been hit hardest, suffering an alarming 75% year-over-year rise to 3,574 weekly attacks, as cyber criminals exploit the vast troves of personal data held by schools. As we mark the International Day of Education on January 24th, it’s crucial […]</p>
