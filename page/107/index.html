		<p>Empowering humanitarian action with open source: A natural language search tool for UN Resolutions.</p>
<p>The post 4 steps to building a natural language search tool appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p><strong>“We have a problem. Our current search method for sifting through PDFs is extremely manual and time consuming. Is there an easier way?”</strong></p>
<p>As a developer, this is one of those questions that really gets me excited. I was tasked with finding a way to transform a cumbersome, archival process into an efficient, intuitive search experience. It’s a way to make a group of people’s lives easier, and because of the organizations they work for, help them be more effective in providing humanitarian assistance to people in need around the world. I couldn’t imagine a better project to be working on.</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Today, I’m thrilled to announce that Amazon Redshift, a widely used, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse, is taking a significant step forward in strengthening the default security posture of our customers’ data warehouses. Some default security settings for newly created provisioned clusters, Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroups, and clusters restored from snapshots have changed. These changes include disabling public accessibility, enabling database encryption, and enforcing secure connections.</p>
<p>Amazon Redshift already supports encryption in transit and at rest. Database encryption is crucial because it helps safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access. Furthermore, restricting public access can be advantageous because it limits the threat surface and helps prevent unauthorized access to the database. By confining the Amazon Redshift cluster within the customer’s virtual private cloud (VPC), the cluster is isolated from the public internet, which significantly reduces the possibility of unauthorized parties discovering and accessing the data warehouse.</p>

</p>
<p>Remember the ZEOS Pocket PC? Perhaps you knew it as the Tidalwave PS-1000. Either way, it was a small clamshell computing device that was first released all the way back in 1992, and perhaps most accurately known as a DOS-based palmtop. Over at [Robert’s Retro] on YouTube, one of these fine devices was put through a repair and a modern upgrade program.</p>
<p>[Robert] educates us on the basics of the machine as he sets about the routine repairs so familiar to anyone in the retrocomputing scene. The first order of business is to clean up the damage to the battery compartment, which had suffered corrosion from leaking AA batteries. We get a solid look inside, and a walk-through on how to modify the device to run off USB-C power. It’s as simple as wiring up a small power module PCB and integrating that into the case, but it’s a neat mod done well—and it makes toying with the device much easier in 2025.</p>
