<p>Threat actors on X are exploiting the news around Ross Ulbricht to direct unsuspecting users to a Telegram channel that tricks them into run PowerShell code that infects them with malware.</p>
<p>The attack, spotted by vx-underground, is a new variant of the “Click-Fix” tactic that has become very popular among threat actors to distribute malware over the past year.</p>
<p>However, instead of being fixes for common errors, this variant pretends to be a captcha or verification system that users must run to join the channel.</p>

		<p>The Texas Attorney General’s Office has started an investigation into how Ford, Hyundai, Toyota, and Fiat Chrysler collect, share, and sell consumer data, expanding an earlier probe launched last year into how modern automakers are potentially using customer driving data.</p>
<p>We’ve addressed cars and privacy at some length on Malwarebytes Labs and came to the conclusion—with the help of many experts in the field—that modern cars simply aren’t very good at it. Many politicians in the US agree with that point of view, too, as US senators have asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate car makers’ privacy practices.</p>

<p>2024 saw an escalation in cyber attacks on the critical Education Sector. Looking at overall numbers, cyber attacks are surging at an alarming rate, with organizations experiencing an average of 1,673 weekly attacks in 2024—a staggering 44% increase from the previous year, according to Check Point’s The State of Cyber Security 2025 report. Out of all sectors, the education sector has been hit hardest, suffering an alarming 75% year-over-year rise to 3,574 weekly attacks, as cyber criminals exploit the vast troves of personal data held by schools. As we mark the International Day of Education on January 24th, it’s crucial […]</p>

<p>Cisco’s ClamAV has a heap-based buffer overflow in its OLE2 file scanning. That’s a big deal, because ClamAV is used to scan file attachments on incoming emails. All it takes to trigger the vulnerability is to send a malicious file through an email system that uses ClamAV.</p>
<p>The exact vulnerability is a string termination check that can fail to trigger, leading to a buffer over-read. That’s a lot better than a buffer overflow while writing to memory. That detail is why this vulnerability is strictly a Denial of Service problem. The memory read results in process termination, presumably a segfault for reading protected memory. There are Proof of Concepts (PoCs) available, but so far no reports of the vulnerability being used in the wild.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Twist and Shout: Faster memory checking arguments via one-hot addressing and increments</strong><br>
<em>Srinath Setty, Justin Thaler</em></p>
<p>A memory checking argument enables a prover to prove to a verifier that it is correctly processing reads and writes to memory. They are used widely in modern SNARKs, especially in zkVMs, where the prover proves the correct execution of a CPU including the correctness of memory operations.</p>
<p>We describe a new approach for memory checking, which we call the method of one-hot addressing and increments. We instantiate this method via two different families of protocols, called Twist and Shout. Twist supports read/write memories, while Shout targets read-only memories (also known as lookup arguments). Both Shout and Twist have logarithmic verifier costs. Unlike prior works, these protocols do not invoke &ldquo;grand product&rdquo; or &ldquo;grand sum&rdquo; arguments.</p>

Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS is scheduled for release on February 13th – in time for Valentines Day, aww. Canonical’s Florent Jacquet shares the date on the Ubuntu Developer mailing list today along with a note to developers to be mindful of their package uploads to noble in the coming weeks. As a result, if you’re using the latest long-term support release you may notice a slightly drop-off in the number of non-essential updates Software Updater bugs you to install between now and February 13. This allow devs to create a snapshot and test it properly. Ubuntu point releases rarely deliver new […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Unveiling Privacy Risks in Quantum Optimization Services</strong><br>
<em>Mateusz Leśniak, Michał Wroński, Ewa Syta, Mirosław Kutyłowski</em></p>
<p>As cloud-based quantum computing services, such as those offered by D-Wave, become more popular for practical applications, privacy-preserving methods (such as obfuscation) are essential to address data security, privacy, and legal compliance concerns. Several efficient obfuscation methods have been proposed, which do not increase the time complexity of solving the obfuscated problem, for quantum optimization problems. These include {em sign reversing}, {em variable permutation}, and the combination of both methods assumed to provide greater protection. Unfortunately, sign reversing has already been shown to be insecure.</p>
