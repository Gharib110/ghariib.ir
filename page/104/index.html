		<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In September 2024, LevelBlue conducted a comprehensive threat hunt targeting artifacts indicative of Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) activity across our monitored customer fleet. During the investigation, the LevelBlue Managed Detection and Response (MDR) Blue Team discovered a new PhaaS kit, now identified as RaccoonO365. The hunt confirmed true-positive compromises of Office 365 accounts, prompting swift customer notifications and guidance on remediation actions. The initial findings were handed over to the LevelBlue Labs Threat Intelligence team, which further uncovered additional infrastructure and deconstructed the kit’s JavaScript. This analysis provided critical insights into the features and capabilities of the emerging PhaaS kit.</p>

		<p>Ansible execution environments provide a reusable and supported operating environment for running Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. These container-based instances provide everything that the desired automation needs to execute successfully, including any of the necessary dependencies and supporting components, while also eliminating many of the challenges faced when running automation at scale. During the process of building execution environments, there may be a need to access content from sources that require authentication. Hardcoding these properties into the build process may present a security concern and does not align with recommended operating practices. In this article, I will present several areas where hardcoded properties are typically used when building execution environments and the alternative options available to produce software more securely.</p>

<p>With ready availability of single board computers, displays, keyboards, power packs, and other hardware, a home-made laptop is now a project within most people’s reach. Some laptop projects definitely veer towards being cyberdecks while others take a more conventional path, but we’ve rarely seen one as professional looking as [Byran Huang]’s anyon_e open source laptop. It really takes the art to the next level.</p>
<p>The quality is immediately apparent in the custom CNC-machined anodised aluminium case, and upon opening it up the curious user could be forgiven for thinking they had a stylish commercial machine in their hands. There’s a slimline mechanical keyboard and a glass trackpad, and that display is an OLED. In fact the whole thing had been built from scratch, and inside is an RK3588 SoC on a module sitting on a custom-designed motherboard. It required some effort for it to drive the display, a process we’ve seen cause pain to other designers, but otherwise it runs Debian. The batteries are slimline pouch cells, with a custom controller board driven by an ESP32.</p>

		<p>Keep an eye on your internet performance using this app.</p>
<p>As someone who’s been working remotely for well over a decade, reliable internet connectivity isn’t just essential — it’s non-negotiable. Whether it’s researching for an article, joining a video call, or catching up on YouTube, inconsistent internet performance can seriously hamper productivity — and leisure. Speed drops, intermittent lags, or latency issues aren’t always consistent; they come and go, making it challenging to hold your internet service provider accountable. In fact, a poor ISP can make investing in the best Wi-Fi routers futile. To address this problem, I’ve been using a Docker-based app to track my internet speed and uptime. Here’s how it worked out.</p>

		<p>With Cloudflare conducting media resource caching at the data center closest in proximity to its users, security researcher Daniel discovered that an information-disclosure intrusion could be conducted through the delivery of a unique image hosted on Cloudflare&rsquo;s CDN to a vulnerable app, which would use the Cloudflare Teleport tool to route the requests to certain data centers.</p>
