<p>DEF CON thrives on community collaboration and has operated for over 30 years successfully working with hundreds of vendors including the dozens that have helped with our badges over the years. For this year’s Raspberry Pi badges, DEF CON hired Entropic Engineering to do the hardware development and firmware. After going overbudget by more than 60%, several bad-faith charges, and with a product still in preproduction, DEF CON issued a stop work order. Any claims that DEF CON did not pay Entropic Engineering for its hardware or firmware development are false. Unfortunately, we heard that these issues with Entropic Engineering were not unique to DEF CON. We decided at that point to finish the badge on our own. We paid to send engineers to Vietnam to work onsite to finalize and test the badges in order to ensure they would be done on time for the conference. We never removed Entropic Engineering’s logo from our badge, it is still on the PCB. However, Entropic was not involved in the design and production of the case, and we removed their logo we had added as a courtesy.</p>

		<p><strong>Dell Technologies,</strong> together with <strong>Wind River</strong> (owned by Intel and Delphi Automotive), is introducing a new telecom cloud infrastructure solution to help communications service providers (CSPs) reduce complexity and accelerate their “<strong>cloud-native”</strong> network deployments.</p>
<p>To facilitate these solutions, <strong>Dell’s telecom partner certification program</strong> simplifies the process for technology partners to validate and integrate their products within a rapidly growing open technology ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks</strong> help accelerate open, cloud-native network deployments.  Dell is taking an entirely new approach to solve the complexities of cloud-native network deployments with Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks. The fully engineered, cloud-native infrastructure blocks simplify telecom cloud network deployment and management, while accelerating the introduction of new technologies and lowering operational expenses (OpEX).</p>

		<p>Rapid advancements in generative AI have enabled organizations to build powerful applications by integrating foundation models with internal data and systems. The potential rewards are high, but so are the risks — from sensitive data exposure and compliance violations to prompt injection and attacks against deployed applications.</p>
<p>To mitigate AI-related risk, organizations need a comprehensive approach that covers the application lifecycle from data collection to model output. In today’s blog post, we look at the current state of genAI security and how Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks can be used alongside Amazon Bedrock to build, manage and deploy secure, AI-powered applications.</p>

		<h2 id="the-problem--the-complexity-of-cloud-environments">The Problem — The Complexity of Cloud Environments</h2>
<p>The complex landscape of cloud services, particularly in multi-cloud environments, poses significant security challenges for organizations. Unmanaged cloud resources, human error, misconfigurations and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, including those from AI-powered applications, create vulnerabilities that can expose sensitive data and disrupt business operations. Organizations are increasingly turning to cloud providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), to address these challenges and power their digital transformation initiatives. However, the vastness of AWS environments and the ease of spinning up new resources and services can lead to cloud sprawl and ongoing security risks.</p>

<p>We’ve always found the various methods for adding text and graphics to 3D prints somewhat underwhelming. Embossed or debossed characters are fuzzy, at best, and multi-color printers always seem to bleed one color into the next. Still, the need for labels and logos is common enough that it’s worth exploring other methods, such as this easy toner transfer trick.</p>
<p>Home PCB makers will probably find the method [Squalius] describes in the video below very familiar, and with good reason. We’ve seen toner transfer used to mask PCBs before etching, and the basic process here is very similar. It starts with printing the desired graphics on regular paper using a laser printer; don’t forget to mirror the print. The printed surface is scuffed up a bit, carefully cleaned, and coated with a thick layer of liquid acrylic medium, of the kind used in paint pouring. The mirrored print is carefully laid on the acrylic, toner-side down, and more medium is brushed on the back of the paper. After the print dries, the paper is removed with a little water and some gentle friction, leaving the toner behind. A coat of polyurethane protects the artwork reasonably well.</p>

<p>Please enjoy Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s fantastic presentation on taking back the internet from last month at DEF CON 32. Cory&rsquo;s takes are always thoughtful, provocative and it was his deshittification concept that helped inspire the DC32 theme. More videos from DEF CON coming soon.</p>
