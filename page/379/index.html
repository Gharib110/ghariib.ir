		<p>Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) firms face growing pressure to protect their investments from cyber threats. Whether it’s a high-profile data breach or tightening regulatory requirements like SOC2 compliance, the stakes are higher than ever. Yet, many portfolio companies—especially those in growth stages—often lack the internal expertise and resources to maintain a robust cybersecurity posture. This reality presents a significant risk, not only to the individual companies but also to the broader investment portfolio.</p>

As another year transitions from present to past, I want1 to recap the notable new features, changes, updates and innovations Ubuntu saw over the past 12 months.
