		<p>Every time you check the weather on your phone, send a message on WhatsApp or pay through PayPal, you interact with APIs. But what exactly are these invisible bridges that power our digital world? Let&rsquo;s dive into the fascinating world of APIs and understand why they&rsquo;re crucial in modern software development.<br>
Before we dive into the tutorial, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at what you should expect:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>Why Do We Need APIs?</li>
<li>Types of APIs</li>
<li>What are the common API architectural styles?</li>
<li>How do APIs work?</li>
<li>Real-world API examples and use cases</li>
<li>What are the benefits of APIs?</li>
<li>What Next?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-an-api-">What is an API? ü§î</h2>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re at a restaurant. You don&rsquo;t walk into the kitchen to cook your meal - instead, you interact with a waiter who takes your order to the kitchen and brings back your food. An API works similarly ‚Äì it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;waiter&rdquo; that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.</p>

		<p><em>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Retro‚Äôing and Debugging 2024.</em></p>
<p>A ruptured tendon in my dominant hand just before Christmas 2023 didn&rsquo;t just derail my coding - it catalyzed an unexpected transformation in my career. Within weeks, I found myself thrust from being &lsquo;just another dev&rsquo; into leading a team of six junior developers, compressing what should have been a gradual transition into a sudden leap.</p>

	<b><time>10.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In technical writing, the choice between active and passive voice plays a crucial role in clarity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The active voice is often preferred for its directness and clarity, making it ideal for instructions and explanations where the focus is on who is performing the action.</p>
<p>In contrast, the passive voice is useful when the action itself or its outcome is more important than the performer, often appearing in scientific or procedural contexts.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>ZODA: Zero-Overhead Data Availability</strong><br>
<em>Alex Evans, Nicolas Mohnblatt, Guillermo Angeris</em></p>
<p>We introduce ZODA, short for &lsquo;zero-overhead data availability,&rsquo; which is a protocol for proving that symbols received from an encoding (for tensor codes) were correctly constructed. ZODA has optimal overhead for both the encoder and the samplers. Concretely, the ZODA scheme incurs essentially no incremental costs (in either computation or size) beyond those of the tensor encoding itself. In particular, we show that a slight modification to the encoding scheme for tensor codes allows sampled rows and columns of this modified encoding to become proofs of their own correctness. When used as part of a data availability sampling protocol, both encoders (who encode some data using a tensor code with some slight modifications) and samplers (who sample symbols from the purported encoding and verify that these samples are correctly encoded) incur no incremental communication costs and only small additional computational costs over having done the original tensor encoding. ZODA additionally requires no trusted setup and is plausibly post-quantum secure.</p>
