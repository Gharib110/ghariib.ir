<p>I’m frequently amused by the sort of stuff my Facebook friends “like”. For example:</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>The more salacious content you find around Facebook often has a hidden agenda, for example the classic She did WHAT in school scam I wrote about last year. Snapchat allows you to take a pic or a video and set an expiry date after which it’s “theoretically” destroyed, just the sort of stuff that appeals to sexting teens. By extension, “leaked” Snapchats are just the sort of stuff that appeal to a whole different audience.</p>

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), security, high performance, and strong encryption for everyone are top priorities for all our services. With these priorities in mind, less than a year after QUIC ratification in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), we are introducing support for the QUIC protocol which can boost performance for web applications that currently use Transport Layer Security (TLS) over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). We are pleased to announce the availability of s2n-quic, an open-source Rust implementation of the QUIC protocol added to our set of AWS encryption open-source libraries.</p>

	<div>
		<p>SMS services remain a critical part of telecommunications; they don&rsquo;t require Internet access, and companies use them to inform their customers. This combination of features makes them incredibly useful for criminals who use the technology as a stepping stone in their never-ending campaigns. And if you think that the new RCS messaging standard will offer any protection, you would be wrong. These types of scams will continue to spread regardless of the messaging standard used.</p>

<p>I want to try something new here - bear with me here:</p>
<p>Data breach processing is <em>hard</em> and the hardest part of all is getting in touch with organisations and disclosing the incident before I load anything into Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). It&rsquo;s also something I do almost entirely in isolation, sitting here on my own trying to put the pieces together to work out what happened. I don&rsquo;t want to just chuck data into HIBP and the first an organisation knows about it is angry customers smashing out their inbox, there&rsquo;s got to be a reasonable attempt from my side to get in touch, disclose and then coordinate on communication to impacted parties and the public at large. Very frequently, I end up reaching out publicly and asking for a security contact at the impacted company. I dislike doing this because it&rsquo;s a very public broadcast that regular followers easily read between the lines of and draw precisely the correct conclusion before the organisation has had a chance to respond. And the vast majority of the time, nobody has a contact anyway but a small handful of people trawl through the site and find obscure email addresses or look up employees on LinkedIn or similar. There has to be a better way.</p>

<p>The EUDI (European Digital Identity) wallet solution reference architecture (ARF) is designed to provide a secure framework for managing digital identities across various services. However, it is essential to identify and address potential vulnerabilities within the ARF. Failure to do so will compromise the security, privacy and integrity of the system. </p>

<p>As a first step, we search for threat actors that traditionally both targeted the <strong>financial industry</strong> and <strong>Singaporean companies</strong>.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Leuvenshtein: Efficient FHE-based Edit Distance Computation with Single Bootstrap per Cell</strong><br>
<em>Wouter Legiest, Jan-Pieter D&rsquo;Anvers, Bojan Spasic, Nam-Luc Tran, Ingrid Verbauwhede</em></p>
<p>This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called LVS{}. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 28 operations—required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm—to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilizing preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to $205times$ faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to $39times$ faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional $3times$ speedup can be achieved.</p>

<strong>Yoran&rsquo;s Passing Comes 10 Months After Cancer Diagnosis, 1 Month After Taking Leave</strong><br>
Amit Yoran - a West Point graduate who founded NetWitness, sold the company to RSA and took Tenable public - died Friday. He was 54. Yoran was diagnosed in March 2024 with a treatable form of cancer, and in December temporarily stepped away from his role as Tenable&rsquo;s CEO to get additional treatment.</p>
