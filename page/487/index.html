		<p>Upgrades are necessary in any industry that relies upon IT infrastructure to do business. From adopting new features and addressing common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) to enhancing security and complying with support requirements, there are many business-critical reasons to upgrade your software infrastructure. This is especially true for service providers operating in rapidly changing market conditions. By offering the fastest network with advanced services and features, upgrades help service providers maintain customer satisfaction, grow revenue, and ensure long-term success. Even so,</p>

		<p>I’ve noticed that many shops are increasingly using e-paper displays. They’re impressive: high contrast, no backlight, and no visible cables. Unlike most electronics, these displays are seamlessly integrated and feel very natural. This got me wondering: is it possible to use such a display for a pet project? I want to experiment with this technology myself.</p>

<p>My main goal in this project is to understand the hardware and its capabilities. Here, I&rsquo;ll be using an e-paper display to show the current weather, but at its core, I’m simply feeding data from a website to the display. While it sounds straightforward, it actually requires three layers of software to pull off. Still, it’s a fun challenge and a great opportunity to work with both embedded hardware and Cloudflare Workers.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The stakes of compliance and risk management have reached unprecedented heights. Organizations are not just dealing with regulations; they are fighting to protect their reputation, assets, and, most importantly, their people. Among the most effective yet often overlooked methods to ensure preparedness against these threats are tabletop tests.</p>

<p>Tabletop tests serve as a simulation platform where teams can walk through potential incidents in a structured format, offering a deep dive into the intricacies of business continuity plans (BCPs), disaster recovery plans (DRPs), and incident response plans (IRPs). With regulatory requirements from authorities like FFIEC, FDIC, and NCUA, alongside industry standards such as SOC2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR, regular tabletop exercises are not just beneficial—they’re essential to maintaining compliance and ensuring operational resilience.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Anthropic recently unveiled the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants and models to reliable data and tools. However, packaging and distributing MCP servers is very challenging due to complex environment setups across multiple architectures and operating systems. Docker is the perfect solution for this — it allows developers to encapsulate their development environment into containers, ensuring consistency across all team members’ machines and deployments consistent and predictable. In this blog post, we provide a few examples of using Docker to containerize Model Context Protocol (MCP) to simplify building AI applications. </p>

		<p>Difficulty: Easy</p>
<p>Earth is an easy box though you will likely find it more challenging than &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; in this series and on the harder side of easy, depending on your experience. There are two flags on the box: a user and root flag which include an md5 hash. This has been tested on VirtualBox so may not work correctly on VMware.
