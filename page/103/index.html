		<p>A sophisticated race condition vulnerability affecting Windows 11 (x64) kernel operations, highlighting ongoing concerns about kernel-level security in modern operating systems.</p>
<p>These race conditions, which stem from the operating system’s inability to synchronize shared resources during concurrent operations properly, could potentially allow attackers to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or crash critical systems.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities identified by the researcher with handled wetw0rk have been dubbed “KernelSyncLeaks” and represent a significant challenge for Microsoft’s most advanced operating system to date.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Optimizing Key Recovery in Impossible Cryptanalysis and Its Automated Tool</strong><br>
<em>Jianing Zhang, Haoyang Wang</em></p>
<p>Impossible differential (ID) cryptanalysis and impossible boomerang (IB) cryptanalysis are two methods of impossible cryptanalysis against block ciphers. Since the seminal work introduced by Boura et al. in 2014, there have been no substantial advancements in the key recovery process for impossible cryptanalysis, particularly for the IB attack.In this paper, we propose a generic key recovery framework for impossible cryptanalysis that supports arbitrary key-guessing strategies, enabling optimal key recovery attacks. Within the framework, we provide a formal analysis of probabilistic extensions in impossible cryptanalysis for the first time. Besides, for the construction of IB distinguishers, we propose a new method for finding contradictions in multiple rounds.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Quantum function secret sharing</strong><br>
<em>Alex B. Grilo, Ramis Movassagh</em></p>
<p>We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $ket{psi}$ and a projection $Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $lVertPi Cket{psi}rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover, the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$. Our protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the Cayley path, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Shadowfax: Combiners for Deniability</strong><br>
<em>Phillip Gajland, Vincent Hwang, Jonas Janneck</em></p>
<p>As cryptographic protocols transition to post-quantum security, most adopt hybrid solutions combining pre-quantum and post-quantum assumptions. However, this shift often introduces trade-offs in terms of efficiency, compactness, and in some cases, even security. One such example is deniability, which enables users, such as journalists or activists, to deny authorship of potentially incriminating messages. While deniability was once mainly of theoretical interest, protocols like X3DH, used in Signal and WhatsApp, provide it to billions of users. Recent work (Collins et al., PETS'25) has further bridged the gap between theory and real-world applicability. In the post-quantum setting, however, protocols like PQXDH, as well as others such as Apple’s iMessage with PQ3, do not support deniability. This work investigates how to preserve deniability in the post-quantum setting by leveraging unconditional (statistical) guarantees instead of computational assumptions - distinguishing deniability from confidentiality and authenticity.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>TallyGuard: Privacy Preserving Tallied-as-cast Guarantee</strong><br>
<em>Athish Pranav Dharmalingam, Sai Venkata Krishnan, KC Sivaramakrishnan, N.S. Narayanaswamy</em></p>
<p>This paper presents a novel approach to verifiable vote tallying using additive homomorphism, which can be appended to existing voting systems without modifying the underlying infrastructure. Existing End-to-End Verifiable (E2E-V) systems like Belenios and ElectionGuard rely on distributed trust models or are vulnerable to decryption compromises, making them less suitable for general elections. Our approach introduces a tamper-evident commitment to votes through cryptographic hashes derived from homomorphic encryption schemes such as Paillier. The proposed system provides tallied-as-cast verifiability without revealing individual votes, thereby preventing coercion. The system also provides the ability to perform public verification of results. We also show that this system can be transitioned to quantum-secure encryption like Regev for future-proofing the system. We discuss how to deploy this system in a real-world scenario, including for general political elections, analyzing the security implications and report on the limitations of this system. We believe that the proposed system offers a practical solution to the problem of verifiable vote tallying in general elections.</p>
