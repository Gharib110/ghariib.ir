		<p>Last week, I had the delightful experience of reviewing the rough cuts of <em>The Phoenix Project Graphic Novel</em>, Volume 2. It resurrected so many memories from working on the original book nearly 15 years ago. (The first working drafts that George Spafford and I worked on together were from 2005, so that’s 20 years ago!)</p>
<p>In Volume 2 of the graphic novel, which comes out later this year, there are many scenes with Bill and his wife and kids. These scenes were originally written around 2011, right after I left Tripwire. Seeing those blissful scenes of Bill and his young children brings back so many memories!</p>

		<p>Red Hat recently released an integration with PagerDuty, allowing events detected by Insights and the Hybrid Cloud Console (aka the console) to be sent from the console to PagerDuty. From the docs: “When an issue in the Hybrid Cloud Console is detected, PagerDuty automatically notifies the appropriate team members through phone calls, SMS, emails, or push notifications. PagerDuty uses scheduling to ensure team members are alerted only during their designated times. You can create escalation policies to escalate an issue to another team member if the first on-call team member does not respon</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Signatures with Tight Adaptive Corruptions from Search Assumptions</strong><br>
<em>Keitaro Hashimoto, Wakaha Ogata, Yusuke Sakai</em></p>
<p>We construct the first tightly secure signature schemes in the multi-user setting with adaptive corruptions from classical discrete logarithm, RSA, factoring, or post-quantum group action discrete logarithm assumption. In contrast to our scheme, the previous tightly secure schemes are based on the decisional assumption (e.g., (group action) DDH) or interactive search assumptions (e.g., one-more CDH). The security of our schemes is independent of the number of users, signing queries, and RO queries, and forging our signatures is as hard as solving the underlying search problem. Our starting point is an identification scheme with multiple secret keys per public key (e.g., Okamoto identification (CRYPTO'92) and parallel-OR identification (CRYPTO'94)). This property allows a reduction to solve a search problem while answering corruption queries for all users in the signature security game. To convert such an identification scheme into a signature scheme tightly, we employ randomized Fischlin&rsquo;s transformation introduced by Kondi and shelat (Asiacrypt 2022) that provides straight-line extraction. Intuitively, the transformation properties guarantee the tight security of our signature scheme in the programmable random oracle model, but we successfully prove its tight security in the non-programmable random oracle model.</p>

<p>One of the major limitations of 3D printers is the size of the printable area. The robotic arm holding the printer head can only print where it can reach, after all. Some methods of reducing this constraint have been tried before, largely focusing on either larger printers or printer heads that are mobile in some way. Another approach to increasing the size of prints beyond the confined space typical of most consumer-grade 3D printers is to create some sort of joinery into the prints themselves so that larger things can be created. [Cal Bryant] is developing this jigsaw-based method which has allowed him to produce some truly massive prints.</p>

		<p>A little bit of ingenuity (and some Lego) can go a long way.</p>
<p>You know, when it comes to DIY projects, we like to see ideas that use 3D printers and pre-bought materials that get the job done. However, when we do, we lose sight of the <em>real</em> foundation of DIY fans everywhere: Lego blocks. If you&rsquo;re tired of telling yourself that your electronic projects can&rsquo;t use colorful building blocks to house them, then check out this cool example that uses Lego to get the job done.</p>

<p>With the slow demise of physical media the past years, companies are gradually closing shop on producing everything from the physical media itself to their players and recorders. For Sony this seems to have now escalated to where it’ll be shuttering its recordable optical media storage operations, after more than 18 years of producing recordable Blu-ray discs. As noted by [Toms Hardware] this also includes minidisc (MD) media and MiniDV cassettes.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Subnetting is a crucial networking technique that divides a large network (IP address range) into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. This improves network efficiency, security, and scalability. Instead of a single, large broadcast domain, subnetting allows for multiple smaller ones, reducing broadcast traffic and enhancing performance.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<p>Understanding IP addressing (IPv4 and its classful/classless addressing), binary number systems, and basic networking concepts is essential before delving into subnetting. Familiarity with subnet masks is also crucial.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Technology-Dependent Synthesis and Optimization of Circuits for Small S-boxes</strong><br>
<em>Zihao Wei, Siwei Sun, Fengmei Liu, Lei Hu, Zhiyu Zhang</em></p>
<p>Boolean formula minimization is a notoriously hard problem that is known to be $varSigma_2^P$-complete. Circuit minimization, typically studied in the context of a much broader subject known as synthesis and optimization of circuits, introduces another layer of complexity since ultimately those technology-independent epresentations (e.g., Boolean formulas and truth tables) has to be transformed into a netlist of cells of the target technology library. To manage those complexities, the industrial community typically separates the synthesis process into two steps: technology-independent optimization and technology mapping. In each step, this approach only tries to find the local optimal solution and relies heavily on heuristics rather than a systematic search. However, for small S-boxes, a more systematic exploration of the design space is possible. Aiming at the global optimum, we propose a method which can synthesize a truth table for a small S-box directly into a netlist of the cells of a given technology library. Compared with existing technology-dependent synthesis tools like LIGHTER and PEIGEN, our method produces improved results for many S-boxes with respect to circuit area. In particular, by applying our method to the $mathbb{F}_{2^4}$-inverter involved in the tower field implementation of the AES S-box, we obtain the currently known lightest implementation of the AES S-box. The search framework can be tweaked to take circuit delay into account. As a result, we find implementations for certain S-boxes with both latency and area improved.</p>
