<p>Threat actors are exploiting an unspecified zero-day vulnerability in Cambium Networks cnPilot routers to deploy a variant of the AISURU botnet called AIRASHI to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>According to QiAnXin XLab, the attacks have leveraged the security flaw since June 2024. Additional details about the shortcomings have been withheld to prevent further abuse.</p>
<p>Some of the other flaws weaponized by the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet include CVE-2013–3307, CVE-2016–20016, CVE-2017–5259, CVE-2018–14558, CVE-2020–25499, CVE-2020–8515, CVE-2022–3573, CVE-2022–40005, CVE-2022–44149, CVE-2023–28771, as well as those impacting AVTECH IP cameras, LILIN DVRs, and Shenzhen TVT devices.</p>

	<div>
		<p>This past December, I dedicated my winter vacation to diving into the world of blockchain technology. My main goal was to learn enough to contribute to a project my club was working on for an upcoming event. Here’s a little about my journey, what I learned, and what we built!</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h3>
<p>I started with the <strong>basics of blockchain technology</strong>, including fundamental terms, hashing algorithms, and how blockchains achieve decentralization. Then, I explored two of the most popular blockchains:</p>

		<p>Metadata can reveal information that should remain confidential. We explain how to remove it.</p>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you probably share plenty of photos, videos and documents, and send lots of voice messages and emails every single day too. But how often do you stop to consider the additional data contained in these files? For each of these files/media contains metadata — which can reveal a lot of interesting details not meant for prying eyes; for example, a photo’s time and location, a document’s editing history, device information, IP address, geolocation, and much more. So, for example, whenever you post an innocent selfie on social media, you’re also making public a whole ton of extra information that you might not necessarily want others to see.</p>

		<p>JavaScript is a powerhouse. It’s flexible, powerful, and frankly, one of the biggest reasons the web feels as interactive as it does today. But with great power comes great responsibility (to not ship bloated, laggy code).</p>
<p>In 2025, the game isn’t just about writing code that works—it’s about writing code that works fast. Users demand speed. They’ll bounce from your app if it takes even a second longer to load than they expect.</p>

		<p>As a child, I was told by many people that the United States was the only free country in the world, the land of the free, which implicitly suggested that every other country was somehow not free. I thought that other countries were tyrannical states, which subjugated their citizens and treated them like slaves. As I grew older, I realized that nothing was further from the truth. A myriad of free societies exist throughout the world, many of which are free in ways that are completely different from the United States.</p>
