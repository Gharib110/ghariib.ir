		<p>JavaScript is a powerhouse. It’s flexible, powerful, and frankly, one of the biggest reasons the web feels as interactive as it does today. But with great power comes great responsibility (to not ship bloated, laggy code).</p>
<p>In 2025, the game isn’t just about writing code that works—it’s about writing code that works fast. Users demand speed. They’ll bounce from your app if it takes even a second longer to load than they expect.</p>

		<p>As a child, I was told by many people that the United States was the only free country in the world, the land of the free, which implicitly suggested that every other country was somehow not free. I thought that other countries were tyrannical states, which subjugated their citizens and treated them like slaves. As I grew older, I realized that nothing was further from the truth. A myriad of free societies exist throughout the world, many of which are free in ways that are completely different from the United States.</p>

		<p>The Turkish government is proposing a controversial new cybersecurity law that could make it a criminal act to report on data breaches. The new legislation proposes penalties for various cybersecurity-related offences. But they key one which has people concerned is this: &ldquo;Those who carry out activities aimed at targeting institutions or individuals by creating the perception that there has been a data breach in cyberspace, even though there has been no data breach, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two to five years.&rdquo; The problem is, of course, that such a law may discourage the&hellip;</p>
