		<p><strong>Open-source technology</strong> has significantly shaped how industries approach complex technical challenges and foster innovation. It has expanded beyond software to impact hardware and systems design, opening up new pathways for researchers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts to develop advanced solutions. This collective approach fuels innovation and contributes to sustainable development by creating accessible, adaptable tools that solve real-world problems at scale.</p>

<p>Open-source technology fundamentally changes how we access and utilise high-tech tools. Traditionally, advanced instruments like oscilloscopes, signal generators, and spectrum analysers were accessible primarily to well-funded research labs. With open-source tools such as Red Pitaya’s “pocket lab,” engineers and students can now access powerful measurement and testing capabilities in a compact, cost-effective format. This allows universities, startups, and even independent researchers and enthusiasts to innovate without being restricted by cost or proprietary limitations.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When managing a database, it&rsquo;s often useful to identify which tables contain data. This can help with troubleshooting, maintenance, or simply understanding the database&rsquo;s structure and usage. Here’s how to check for tables with data across different relational database management systems (RDBMS).</p>
<h2 id="for-postgresql"><strong>For PostgreSQL</strong></h2>
<p>In PostgreSQL, you can dynamically generate a query to check row counts for all tables within a schema using <code>pg_catalog.pg_tables</code>:</p>
<h3 id="using-a-plpgsql-block">Using a PL/pgSQL Block:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DO $$
DECLARE
    tbl RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR tbl IN
        SELECT schemaname, tablename
        FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
        WHERE schemaname = &#39;public&#39;  -- Change schema if needed
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format(
            &#39;SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, &#39;&#39;%I&#39;&#39; AS table_name FROM %I.%I&#39;,
            tbl.tablename, tbl.schemaname, tbl.tablename
        );
    END LOOP;
END $$;
</code></pre><p>This script loops through all tables in the <code>public</code> schema and outputs the row count for each table.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In the context of DevOps, Kubernetes plays a crucial role in enabling continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure management. By managing containers across multiple environments, Kubernetes ensures that applications are scalable, resilient, and easily maintainable—key aspects of any DevOps workflow.</p>
<p>This post explores how to implement DevOps practices using Kubernetes, highlighting the major features that make Kubernetes an ideal platform for automating DevOps processes and streamlining the development lifecycle.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Ansible execution environments provide a runtime for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform that includes all of the necessary tooling in a single atomic package. Ansible, as an automation tool, relies on Python as its underlying programming language. Not only is Python integral to the core of Ansible, but its use is widespread and can be found throughout the Ansible ecosystem, including Ansible execution environments. As a result, how Python content is managed directly impacts how an execution environment is constructed and operates at runtime. This article will explore the various ways that Python can be managed in Ansible execution environments, including considerations that apply to a variety of operating environments.</p>

		<p>SASE components: ZTNA, CASB CSWG, NGFW, SD-WAN, and how they improve network security</p>
<p>The traditional network security model — with a secure perimeter and encrypted channels for external access to that perimeter — is coming apart at the seams. Cloud services and remote working have challenged the very notion of “perimeter”, while the primary method of accessing the perimeter — VPN — has in recent years become a prime attack vector for intruders. Many high-profile hacks began by exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN solutions: CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887 and CVE-2024-21893 in Ivanti Connect Secure, and CVE-2023-4966 in Citrix solutions. By compromising a VPN server, which needs to be accessible online, intruders gain privileged access to an enterprise’s internal network and plenty of scope for covert attack development.</p>

		<p>In my time working in the software industry, I have encountered recurring issues involving versioning. Which version scheme should we use for project X? When should we bump the major version? Is this pull request a breaking change? We want to cut a new release, but what should the next version be?</p>
<p>Versioning schemes communicate new features, bug fixes, and even breaking changes to our users. Some schemes are like a contract with users, giving them guarantees for types of version changes. For instance, a major version bump from version 2.4 to 3.0 usually implies a breaking change and a substantial new functionality. Consumers of software (e.g., Linux distributions) can decide when and how to use the new versions. </p>
