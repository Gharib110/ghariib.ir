<p>With net zero and carbon reduction increasingly becoming a focal point for organisations, support through energy efficiency and sustainable transformation projects are crucial to the success of a carbon reduction plan. However, driving down energy consumption and rolling out energy projects is the responsibility of more than one department in an organisation. Many people – from engineers to investors and from management to staff – need to be brought together to make success happen.</p>

		<p>The European Union today imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence officers for their involvement in a series of cyberattacks targeting Estonian government agencies in 2020. </p>
<p>The individuals, identified as Nikolay Alexandrovich Korchagin, Vitaly Shevchenko, and Yuriy Fedorovich Denisov, are members of Russia’s General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU) Unit 29155. </p>
<p>This covert unit is notorious for its disrupting activities, including cyber espionage, sabotage, and crimes across Europe.</p>
<h2 id="three-russian-hackers-sanctioned"><strong>Three Russian Hackers</strong> <strong>Sanctioned</strong></h2>
<p>The attacks orchestrated by Unit 29155 breached the computer systems of several Estonian ministries, including Economic Affairs and Communications, Social Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. </p>

	<div>
		<p>The pace of IT’s evolution is staggering—can you feel it? Just a few years ago, the focus was on decoupling monolithic legacy applications into microservices architectures. While that transformation remains important, today’s conversations have shifted to adopting large language models (LLMs) that unlock actionable insights and deliver competitive advantages across industries. The urgency is undeniable, and it’s pushing businesses to explore and implement AI as they strive to remain relevant. But here’s the critical question: Are you truly prepared to embrace AI, or are outdated prac</p>

		<p>A new cyberattack campaign, dubbed the “Fake DeepSeek Campaign,” has been discovered targeting macOS users. DeepSeek, a Chinese-developed AI chatbot, has rapidly gained popularity globally.</p>
<p>Threat Actors started exploiting its popularity to deliver malware &amp; infect users’ computers.</p>
<p>This campaign is designed to distribute the Poseidon Stealer, a sophisticated piece of malware to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised systems. </p>
<p>Security researchers with X handle @g0njxa have identified the campaign leveraging fake applications and malicious payloads to infiltrate macOS environments.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>FINAL bootstrap acceleration on FPGA using DSP-free constant-multiplier NTTs</strong><br>
<em>Jonas Bertels, Hilder V. L. Pereira, Ingrid Verbauwhede</em></p>
<p>This work showcases Quatorze-bis, a state-of-the-art Number Theoretic Transform circuit for TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs. It contains a novel modular multiplication design for modular multiplication with a constant for a constant modulus. This modular multiplication design does not require any DSP units or any dedicated multiplier unit, nor does it require extra logic whencompared to the state-of-the-art modular multipliers. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a constant multiplier Number Theoretic Transform design for TFHE-like schemes. Lastly, we use this Number Theoretic Transform design to implement a FINAL hardware accelerator for the AMD Alveo U55c which improves the Throughput metric of TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs by a factor 9.28x over Li et al.&rsquo;s NFP CHES 2024 accelerator and by 10-25% over the absolute state-of-the-art design FPT while using one third of FPTs DSPs.</p>

		<p>Phemex, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, suffered a significant cyberattack that resulted in the theft of $85 million worth of digital assets. </p>
<p>The platform’s hot wallets, which are linked to the internet for real-time transactions, were the primary target of the hack. These wallets are more susceptible to intrusions than cold wallets, which stay offline.</p>
<p>Phemex has since implemented emergency measures to safeguard user funds and initiated a comprehensive investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>A DevOps dashboard is a visual representation of key metrics, data, and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that allow teams to track the performance of their applications, infrastructure, and DevOps processes. These dashboards provide insights into the health of the system, streamline communication between development, operations, and business teams, and help organizations make data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>Building a DevOps dashboard involves selecting the right metrics to track, integrating various data sources, and ensuring that the dashboard is user-friendly and actionable. In this post, we will walk through the process of building a DevOps dashboard, focusing on its major features and how it can drive improvements in efficiency, monitoring, and decision-making.</p>
