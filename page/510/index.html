		<p>When Southwest Airlines’ crew scheduling system became overwhelmed during the 2022 holiday season, the company faced what would become a $800 million operational meltdown. CIO Lauren Woods and her technology team hadn’t caused the crisis, but they would need to solve it. </p>
<p>“I liken it to being like a designated driver at a party,” Woods reflects. “You didn’t bring the Wild Turkey, but all of a sudden you’re responsible for getting everybody home safe.”</p>

<p>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of material that’s been receiving significant attention as a possible successor of silicon. Recently, a team of researchers has demonstrated the use of TMDs as an alternative to through-silicon-vias (TSV), which is the current way that multiple layers of silicon semiconductor circuitry are stacked, as seen with, e.g., NAND Flash ICs and processors with stacked memory dice. The novelty here is that the new circuitry is grown directly on top of the existing circuitry, removing the need for approaches like TSV to turn 2D layers into 3D stacks.</p>
