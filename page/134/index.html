<p>If you are like us, you probably just spin up your own code for a lot of simple projects. But that’s wasteful if you are trying to do anything serious. Take a robot, for example. Are you using ROS (Robot Operating System)? If not — or even if you are — check out [Janne Karttunene] and the University of Eastern Finland’s open-source course Robotics and ROS 2 Essentials.</p>
<p>The material is on GitHub. Rather than paraphrase, here’s the description from the course itself:</p>

		<p>Fortra’s Tripwire has always been widely known as a File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) solution, and a very good one at that. The good news is that it still is - only when you look closely, it’s a lot more. And it always has been. Besides its traditionally known role as an integrity and security configuration management tool, Tripwire’s powerful capabilities make it a comprehensive cybersecurity solution. Did you know that with Tripwire, you could: Detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) Identify ransomware Discover zero-day attacks Implement zero trust policies Far more than facilitating&hellip;</p>

		<p>The United States ban on TikTok went into effect on January 19, 2025, and our data showed a clear impact starting after 03:30 UTC (10:30 PM ET on January 18, 2025). The ban was part of the &ldquo;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,&rdquo; proposed in Congress, which ordered ByteDance to divest due to alleged security concerns. The bill was signed into law by Congress and President Biden in April 2024, and was upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Uncovering Security Vulnerabilities in Intel Trust Domain Extensions</strong><br>
<em>Upasana Mandal, Shubhi Shukla, Nimish Mishra, Sarani Bhattacharya, Paritosh Saxena, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay</em></p>
<p>Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) has emerged as a crucial technology aimed at strengthening the isolation and security guarantees of virtual machines, especially as the demand for secure computation is growing largely. Despite the protections offered by TDX, in this work, we dig deep into the security claims and uncover an intricate observation in TDX. These findings undermine TDX&rsquo;s core security guarantees by breaching the isolation between the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) and Trust Domains (TDs). In this work for the first time, we show through a series of experiments that these performance counters can also be exploited by the VMM to differentiate between activities of an idle and active TD. The root cause of this leakage is core contention. This occurs when the VMM itself, or a process executed by the VMM, runs on the same core as the TD. Due to resource contention on the core, the effects of the TD&rsquo;s computations become observable in the performance monitors collected by the VMM. This finding underscore the critical need for enhanced protections to bridge these gaps within these advanced virtualized environments.</p>

		<h1 id="understanding-the-cnn-algorithm-convolutional-neural-networks">Understanding the CNN Algorithm (Convolutional Neural Networks)</h1>
<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, particularly in computer vision tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition. CNNs are inspired by the human visual system, designed to identify patterns and features in data hierarchically.</p>
<h2 id="how-cnns-work">How CNNs Work</h2>
<h3 id="1-convolutional-layers">1. Convolutional Layers</h3>
<ul>
<li>The core component of a CNN, convolutional layers, applies filters to the input data to extract features like edges, shapes, and textures.</li>
<li>Each filter slides over the input, performing a mathematical operation (convolution) to produce feature maps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-pooling-layers">2. Pooling Layers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of feature maps, making the network computationally efficient and resilient to minor variations in input data.</li>
<li>Common pooling techniques include max pooling (selecting the maximum value in a region) and average pooling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fully-connected-layers">3. Fully Connected Layers</h3>
<ul>
<li>These layers connect all neurons and process extracted features to make final predictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-activation-functions">4. Activation Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applications-of-cnns">Applications of CNNs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Classification:</strong> Recognizing objects in photos (e.g., cats, cars).</li>
<li><strong>Object Detection:</strong> Identifying and locating multiple objects in an image.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Imaging:</strong> Detecting anomalies in X-rays or MRIs.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Tasks like sentiment analysis or handwriting recognition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advantages-of-cnns">Advantages of CNNs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatic feature extraction reduces the need for manual engineering.</li>
<li>Effective in handling large and complex datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p>CNNs have revolutionized machine learning and continue to play a pivotal role in advancing AI-powered technologies. With ongoing research, they are becoming even more powerful and versatile.</p>
