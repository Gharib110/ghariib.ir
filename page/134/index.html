<p>Highlights: HTML files are being used in phishing attacks, mimicking trusted websites HT-ML Guard is designed to analyze HTML files and accurately determine whether they are malicious, enhancing cyber security defenses. Check Point Harmony Email and Collaboration customers remain protected against this type of attack. HTML files are commonly used in the initial stages of cyber attacks. Cyber criminals craft these files to look legitimate, tempting unsuspecting users into a false sense of security. The main goal of these malicious HTML files is to deceive users into either disclosing sensitive information, such as login credentials and personal details, or downloading […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Isogeny-based Cryptography using Isomorphisms of Superspecial Abelian Surfaces</strong><br>
<em>Pierrick Gaudry, Julien Soumier, Pierre-Jean Spaenlehauer</em></p>
<p>We investigate the algorithmic problem of computing isomorphisms between products of supersingular elliptic curves, given their endomorphism rings. This computational problem seems to be difficult when the domain and codomain are fixed, whereas we provide efficient algorithms to compute isomorphisms when part of the codomain is built during the construction. We propose an authentication protocol whose security relies on this asymmetry. Its most prominent feature is that the endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves are not hidden. Furthermore, it does not require a trusted setup.</p>

		<p>Edge computing allows companies to deliver data processing and analysis capabilities to remote sites like branch offices, retail stores, warehouses, and manufacturing plants. Reducing their reliance on centralized cloud or data center resources can significantly improve performance and operational efficiency at remote (a.k.a., edge) business sites while mitigating security risks and enabling real-time insights.

<p>Which would you rather feel? The blast of a fire hose, or a cool, digital rain? That’s what we thought. Introducing Blue Rain — the fire hose that is the BlueSky feed, falling semi-cryptically down your screen in Matrix-style letter droplets. Ahh, isn’t that nice?</p>

</figure>


Now, the rain doesn’t have to be blue. You can change the color, the speed at which it falls, the font, the font size, and other stuff like toggling NSFW, uh, tweets. (Wait, what are we calling BlueSky messages, anyway? Skeets? Really?)</p>

<p>My AWS Learning Journey and Ramp-Up Guide for Beginners<br>
Introduction<br>
Hello, fellow developers! I’m Nikhil , an aspiring Cloud Architect, and today I’m excited to share my AWS learning journey with you. Like many of you, I started with little hands-on experience in the cloud, but after diving into AWS, I’ve learned so much, and I want to help others get on the same path. Whether you’re new to cloud computing or just starting your AWS journey, this post will walk you through the steps I took, the challenges I faced, and a guide on how you can ramp up your AWS skills too.</p>
