<p>DeepSeek’s R1 model launch marks a significant milestone in AI accessibility, combining advanced reasoning capabilities with free, unlimited access. The platform’s explosive growth is evident—its mobile app topped the iOS App Store charts within 48 hours of release, indicating unprecedented user adoption rates. While DeepSeek’s open-source model represents a breakthrough in cost-effective AI deployment, the DeepSeek consumer-facing app introduces substantial privacy and security challenges for enterprises. Most critically, the platform’s data collection practices extend far beyond typical usage data: according to DeepSeek’s privacy policy, all user interactions—including prompts, uploaded files, chat histories, voice inputs, images, and even keystroke patterns—are transmitted […]</p>

<p>San Jose, Calif. – Jan. 28, 2025</p>
<p>The concept of the Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center, also known as the AI SOC, is getting a lot of buzz lately. With it comes the potential to deliver better cybersecurity outcomes for organizations of all sizes. Historically, the SOC has been the domain of the large enterprise. Traditional SOCs were built for larger, well-funded organizations with the resources to benefit from a real-time SecOps command center that can monitor, alert, and act upon suspicious or outright malicious activity across the network. Mid-sized organizations with lean security teams and smaller budgets were priced out. </p>
