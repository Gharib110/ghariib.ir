		<p>Being a 100% remote company for eight years and counting now, weâ€™ve managed to pick up employees across the world. Situated in North America, South America, all across Europe, and even as far as South Korea! (Hey, Antonia ðŸ‘‹)</p>
<p>Not to be confused with our yearly onsites where the whole company gets together (previous locations including our own private island in Croatia, an eco-retreat in the mountains surrounding Barcelona, and most recently, a whole village in the South of France), the Giant Mansion focuses on our different teams getting together to focus on big rocks that they want to tackle and spend some time working face to face. Weâ€™re strong advocates of 100% remote work, but sometimes we like to hang out with each other too. So in total, twice a year, our employees get together, both in their teams and then together as the whole company.</p>

		<p>This is a pretty sad case, and one which Iâ€™m sure all of us have followed since it first started. Surprisingly it hasnâ€™t gotten a whole lot of media attention, but then this legal precedent sticks it to the man and has some consequences regarding the infosec industry â€“ and who would want to publicize [â€¦]</p>

	<div>
		<p>There seems to be a trend towards malware on the Android platform that extorts money from the user somehow, either through premium SMS or services â€“ or the latest trojan â€“ which covertly purchases apps from the mobile market. We first wrote about Android Antivirus software from Symantec back in 2010 and it seems like [â€¦]</p>

		<p>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.</p>
<p>This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committeeâ€™s role in their charter.</p>

		<p>No surprises here, but thereâ€™s been another big MongoDB hack and from the looks of it, itâ€™s been owned for quite some time. This time 2 million records from over 820,000 accounts have been leaked due to yet another default MongoDB installation with no authentication listening on the public IP address. The terrible part is, [â€¦]</p>

		<p>Following shortly after the .io domain cock-up that left thousands vulnerable to domain hijacking, this week more than 750 domains were jacked via registrar Gandi. Seems like some pretty sloppy administration going on, but thatâ€™s how business goes sadly security is still a very much reactive trade.

		<p>Thereâ€™s been a lot of news and scrambling lately related to the Apple SSL vulnerability, and this week Apple announced it would no longer be supporting OS X 10.6 AKA Snow Leopard. It looks like Lion and Mountain Lion will be supported for a while, and an upgrade to Mavericks is free, so thereâ€™s no [â€¦]</p>
