<p>Raspberry Pi cases are a great way to ensure your SBC isn&rsquo;t sitting around, exposed to the elements. However, just because they&rsquo;re practical doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to be boring. We&rsquo;ve seen plenty of 3D-printed Raspberry Pi cases in the past, but this one is especially notable as an excellent addition for anyone using their SBC as a retro console.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-10957<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 7 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The UpdraftPlus: WP Backup &amp; Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.24.11 via deserialization of untrusted input in the &lsquo;recursive_unserialized_replace&rsquo; function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>
