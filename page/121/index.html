		<p>DevSecOps streamlines software development by allowing teams to ship features quickly and providing short feedback cycles for customers. These short feedback cycles can be used to monitor the impact of a feature from the time it is shipped and to inform developers and product managers about the success or failure of a given deployment.</p>
<p>GitLab, as an agnostic DevSecOps platform, can act as an integration point for different CI/CD tools that often contribute to user-facing functionality. For example, the vulnerability report, which displays all detected vulnerabilities, is visible as a single functionality, but the data in the report may come from a number of different tools in various pipelines.</p>

<p>Linux Kernel 6.13 is released! Linus Torvalds announced it in lkml.org on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week, so I’ve tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release.</em></p>
<p>It’s mostly some final driver fixes (gpu and networking dominating – normal), with some doc updates too. And various little stuff all over. The shortlog is appended for people who want to see the details (and, as always, it’s just the shortlog for the last week, the full 6.13 log is obviously much too big).</p>

		<p>NASA is about to introduce new requirements for its contractors. These requirements will dramatically improve the cybersecurity of spacecraft and the US’ resilience to cyber threats. But what do these requirements mean for spacecraft manufacturers? What challenges will they face? And what will they need to do to comply? Keep reading to find out. Understanding the Cyber Space Threat While NASA has cybersecurity requirements for its spacecraft in operation, these requirements do not extend to the spacecraft acquisition and development lifecycle. Essentially, NASA contractors are not currently&hellip;</p>

		<p>The problem with my other TanStack start post was: I did not use the keycloakJS official client library.</p>
<p>Plus I wanted a solution that also works with TanStack-Router loading, pre-fetching and router-based context.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/progwise/tanstack-start-keycloak">https://github.com/progwise/tanstack-start-keycloak</a></p>
<p>It turned out that the biggest issue is to invalidate the router-context correctly. It was not enough to call</p>
<p><code>router.invalidate()</code></p>
<p>on</p>
<p><code>keycloak.onAuthSuccess</code>`</p>
<p>But I needed to re-calculate the context using some beforeLoad:</p>

<p>What do you feel when you hear the TeamSpeak &ldquo;user entered your channel&rdquo; notification? For some, it&rsquo;s just a basic sound notification; for me, it sends me back to a day when my friends and I were hopping on an audio channel so we could do some 40-man Molten Core raids in World of Warcraft, back when expansions weren&rsquo;t even a thing yet.</p>

		<p>Pipeline execution policies are a newer addition to the GitLab DevSecOps platform and a powerful mechanism to enforce CI/CD jobs across applicable projects. They enable platform engineering or security teams to inject jobs into developers’ YAML pipeline definition files, guaranteeing that certain CI/CD jobs will execute no matter what a developer defines in their `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.</p>
<p>This article will explain how to utilize pipeline execution policies to create guardrails around the stages or jobs that a developer can use in their pipeline definition. In regulated environments, this may be necessary to ensure developers adhere to a standard set of jobs or stages in their GitLab pipeline. Any job or stage that a developer adds to their pipeline that does not adhere to a corporate standard will cause the pipeline to fail.</p>

		<p>Recently, I looked at Microsoft’s assigned CVSS v3.1 scores for Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities alongside the Microsoft assigned severity ratings. I wanted to revisit these numbers and see just how closely CVSS aligns with Microsoft’s opinion of severity. Disclaimer: I’m aware that CVSS v4.0 exists. However, Microsoft has not yet adopted it, and I wanted an apples-to-apples comparison. What Is CVSS v3.1? CVSS v3.1 provides the Qualitative Severity Rating Scale, which looks like this: Rating CVSS Score None 0.0 Low 0.1 – 3.9 Medium 4.0 – 6.9 High 7.0 – 8.9 Critical 9.0 – 10.0 Source: FIRST.org&hellip;</p>

<p>Oracle announced new Virtualbox 7.1.6 release this Tuesday with various bug-fixes, performance improvements, and minor new features.</p>
<p>VirtualBox had heavy screen tearing and flickering issue in Linux VMs running with recent Kernel and Wayland for a period of time, that’s why I switched to QEMU/KVM.</p>
<p>Since the last 7.1.4, VirtualBox greatly improved the flickering, black screen and other screen update issues. In the new release, it also fixed issue with Linux guest screen flickering when guest was using VMSVGA graphics adapter.</p>
