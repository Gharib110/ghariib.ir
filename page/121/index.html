In cybersecurity, AI is poised to transform digital defense, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-ai-cyber-defense-initiative/">empowering defenders and enhancing our collective security</a>. Large language models (LLMs) open new possibilities for defenders, from sifting through complex telemetry to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist">secure coding</a>, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/10/from-naptime-to-big-sleep.html">vulnerability</a> <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/leveling-up-fuzzing-finding-more.html">discovery</a>, and streamlining operations. However, some of these same AI capabilities are also available to attackers, leading to understandable anxieties about the potential for AI to be misused for malicious purposes. </p>
