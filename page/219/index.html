		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-13401<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Payment Button for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin&rsquo;s &lsquo;wp_paypal_checkout&rsquo; shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 6.4 | MEDIUM<br>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The WP Inventory Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the &lsquo;message&rsquo; parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.<br>

		<p>According to a DOJ press release, the FBI was able to delete the Chinese-used PlugX malware from “approximately 4,258 U.S.-based computers and networks.”</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To retrieve information from and send commands to the hacked machines, the malware connects to a command-and-control server that is operated by the hacking group. According to the FBI, at least 45,000 IP addresses in the US had back-and-forths with the command-and-control server since September 2023.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t work on that day, I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to be ill.</p>
<p>RPGs on portable consoles are always a treat; you can grind levels or farm for materials while you&rsquo;re traveling, waiting for something, or just a quick session during bedtime. So, when I heard that my favorite modern RPG had gotten Steam Deck verification before its PC debut, you know I had to report on it. If you, too, share my desire to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on the Steam Deck during a cold winter&rsquo;s day, then I have some news for you.</p>
