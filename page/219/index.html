		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>XBOOT: Free-XOR Gates for CKKS with Applications to Transciphering</strong><br>
<em>Chao Niu, Zhicong Huang, Zhaomin Yang, Yi Chen, Liang Kong, Cheng Hong, Tao Wei</em></p>
<p>The CKKS scheme is traditionally recognized for approximate homomorphic encryption of real numbers, but BLEACH (Drucker et al., JoC 2024) extends its capabilities to handle exact computations on binary or small integer numbers.</p>
<p>Despite this advancement, BLEACH&rsquo;s approach of simulating XOR gates via $(a-b)^2$ incurs one multiplication per gate, which is computationally expensive in homomorphic encryption. To this end, we introduce XBOOT, a new framework built upon BLEACH&rsquo;s blueprint but allows for almost free evaluation of XOR gates. The core concept of XBOOT involves lazy reduction, where XOR operations are simulated with the less costly addition operation, $a+b$, leaving the management of potential overflows to later stages. We carefully handle the modulus chain and scale factors to ensure that the overflows would be conveniently rounded during the CKKS bootstrapping phase without extra cost. We use AES-CKKS transciphering as a benchmark to test the capability of XBOOT, and achieve a throughput exceeding one kilobyte per second, which represents a $2.5times$ improvement over the state-of-the-art (Aharoni et al., HES 2023). Moreover, XBOOT enables the practical execution of tasks with extensive XOR operations that were previously challenging for CKKS. For example, we can do Rasta-CKKS transciphering at over two kilobytes per second, more than $10times$ faster than the baseline without XBOOT.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that we reported on someone who got Tetris working in a PDF document. Of course, the next logical step was to get Doom running on it, which they managed to do. However, it turns out that the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. The feat inspired people to attempt to cram the classic FPS into as many productivity-based apps as possible, and now Microsoft Word has fallen victim to the Doom enthusiasts&rsquo; endless crusade to get it running on everything possible.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-13401<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Payment Button for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin&rsquo;s &lsquo;wp_paypal_checkout&rsquo; shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 6.4 | MEDIUM<br>

<p>Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To retrieve information from and send commands to the hacked machines, the malware connects to a command-and-control server that is operated by the hacking group. According to the FBI, at least 45,000 IP addresses in the US had back-and-forths with the command-and-control server since September 2023.</p>
