		<p>There&rsquo;s plenty wrong with the gaming industry that needs to be left in the past, where it belongs.</p>
<p>We love our video games to death, so much so that we&rsquo;re willing to stretch ourselves to buy overpriced GPUs, additional consoles, and way more powerful hardware than we really need, simply to make games look pretty and smooth. What we also love doing (almost as much) is ranting about the things that are wrong with the gaming industry.</p>

<p>High-speed bench equipment has become so much more affordable in the last decade that naturally one wonders what has made that possible. A great source of answers is a teardown by users like [kerry wong] who are kind enough to take apart their MSO2304X 300MHz osilloscope for our viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>The posted teardown video shows the guts of the scope without enclosure, heatsinks and shields that reveal a handful of boards that execute the functions nicely. The motherboard uses the Xilinx KINTEX-7 FPGA that is expected to run core processes such as signal processing as well as managing the sample storage on the paired DDR3 memory.</p>

		<p>DGA is one of the classic techniques for botnets to hide their C2s, attacker only needs to selectively register a very small number of C2 domains, while for the defenders, it is difficult to determine in advance which domain names will be generated and registered.</p>
<p>360 netlab has long focused on the research of botnet attack and defense technology, we maintain a free DGA feed and share the research results with the industry.</p>

		<p>Infiltration of Wolf Haldenstein&rsquo;s systems facilitated the compromise of individuals&rsquo; full names, Social Security numbers, employee identification numbers, medical diagnoses, and medical claim details, none of which has been misused so far, said the law office in a data breach notice detailing that investigation into the extent of the breach only concluded early last month.</p>

		<p>At Mozilla, browser security is a critical mission, and part of that mission involves responding swiftly to new threats. Tuesday, around 8 AM Eastern time, we received a heads-up from the Anti-Virus company ESET, who alerted us to a Firefox exploit that had been spotted in the wild. We want to give a huge thank you to ESET for sharing their findings with us—it’s collaboration like this that keeps the web a safer place for everyone.</p>

They equip each ‘room’ – in our case work device – with a lock, alarms, video surveillance, etc. This way they make sure each visitor or hotel employee uses the private or common spaces safely and legit.

<p>Recently, within the span of a week, a new and extensive phishing campaign compromised more than 7,300 businesses and 40,000 individuals around the world. The most heavily impacted regions are the United States (75%) and the European Union (10%). The hackers are impersonating brands and presenting fake email-based offers. Hackers’ objectives center around driving malicious downloads and collecting harvested credentials that they can exploit for their own financial gain.
