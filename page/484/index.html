<p>We all know that “Can it run <em>DOOM</em>?” is the first question of a hardware hacker. The 1993 first person shooter from id Software defined an entire genre of games, and has since been made open source, appearing on almost everything. Everything, that is, except a Captcha, those annoying “Are you a human” tests where we’re all expected to do a search giant’s image classification for them. So here’s [Guillermo Rauch] with a <em>DOOM</em> captcha, in which you must gun down three bad guys to proceed.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Collaboration and security are essential for delivering high-quality applications in modern software development, especially in cloud-native environments. Developers navigate intricate workflows, connect diverse systems, and safeguard applications against emerging threats — all while maintaining velocity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Think of development as preparing a multi-course meal in a high-pressure, professional kitchen, where precision, timing, and communication are critical. Each developer is a chef working on different parts of the dish, passing ingredients (code) along the way. When one part of the system encounters delays, it can ripple across the process, impacting the final result. Similarly, poor collaboration or security gaps can derail a project, causing delays and inefficiencies. </p>

	<div>
		<p>Regular expressions are powerful input validators and are especially so for formats that follow a predictable pattern, such as phone numbers. A well-constructed regex will ensure that the input is according to the expected format and reduces errors, hence improving data quality.</p>
<p>This article explores how the following regex is used in the validation of common phone number formats across Python, Java, and JavaScript:</p>
<h2 id="the-regular-expression">The Regular Expression</h2>
