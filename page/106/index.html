<p>Although DIY PCB making has made great strides since the early days of chemical etching, there’s one fly in the ointment: vias. These connect individual layers of the board with a conductive tube, and are essential for dual-layer PCBs, never mind boards with a larger layer stack. The industry standard way of producing them is rather cumbersome and doesn’t scale well to a hobby or prototyping context. Might there be a better way? This is the question that [Levi Janssen] set out to answer with a new home PCB manufacturing project.</p>

<p>The artificial intelligence arms race has a new disruptor—DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has quickly gained traction for its advanced language models.  </p>
<p>Positioned as a low-cost alternative to industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, DeepSeek has drawn attention for its rapid growth, affordability, and potential to reshape the AI landscape.  </p>
<p>But as the buzz around its capabilities grows, so do concerns about data privacy, cybersecurity, and the implications of feeding personal information into AI tools with uncertain oversight. </p>

		<p>Researchers have uncovered two critical vulnerabilities in GitHub Copilot, Microsoft’s AI-powered coding assistant, that expose systemic weaknesses in enterprise AI tools. </p>
<p>The flaws—dubbed “Affirmation Jailbreak” and “Proxy Hijack”—allow attackers to bypass ethical safeguards, manipulate model behavior, and even hijack access to premium AI resources like OpenAI’s GPT-o1.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the ease with which AI systems can be manipulated, raising critical concerns about the security and ethical implications of AI-driven development environments.</p>
