		<p>The Department of Justice is investigating a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil for hacking the phones of climate activists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm, according to a lawyer representing the U.S. government. The firm, in turn, was allegedly working on behalf of one of the world‚Äôs largest oil and gas companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not name either company&hellip;</p>

		<p>Imagine introducing a powerful new AI tool that boosts your team&rsquo;s productivity ‚Äî accelerating code development, resolving issues faster, and streamlining workflows. The excitement is palpable, but questions about security and compliance quickly arise. How do you manage the risk of AI inadvertently exposing sensitive data or responding to malicious prompts? This is where prompt guardrails play a crucial role.</p>
<p>Prompt guardrails are structured safeguards ‚Äì combining instructions, filters, and context boundaries ‚Äì designed to guide AI models toward secure and reliable responses. Think of them as safety rails on a bridge, working to keep data and interactions on the correct path while supporting your organization&rsquo;s security protocols. In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore how GitLab implements these guardrails, the risks they address, and their importance for security-conscious enterprises and compliance-focused teams.</p>

<p>Studying for exams doesn‚Äôt have to be stressful. After testing different AI strategies, I found a way to make exam prep more efficient, engaging, and even fun‚Äîall while saving time.

		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming the backbone of modern software development, fueling developer efficiency and accelerating innovation. With the emergence of AI agents implementing code based on instructions from humans, we are learning that implementing AI-based features has its own unique set of security challenges. <strong>How do we protect access to the resources AI needs, protect confidentiality, and avoid privilege escalation</strong>? Few organizations are ready to answer these questions today. At GitLab, we are. We are introducing a new paradigm for identity management: composite identities.</p>

		<p>Conducting security scans is a regular part of any software development process. Whether scanning source code (e.g., Java, Python, or other languages), configuration files (e.g., YAML files), or container images, these scanning tools help development teams be proactive about understanding and addressing security threats.</p>
<p>Traditionally, developers run these security scans as part of CI/CD pipelines. By including these scans in CI/CD, every change to a project will be reviewed to see if any vulnerabilities are introduced. Understanding security concerns during development helps to assure that changes are addressed before they are deployed to a live environment, but there are many additional benefits to conducting container vulnerability scans post deployment as well.</p>

<p>Do you think you could game on a screen the size of a watch face? While it would probably cause eye strain, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a great way to pass the time on those long rides. Well, as it turns out, people have been getting games working on their Samsung Galaxy Watches, and the performance has been impressively solid.</p>

		<p>This past year, over 800 community members have made more than 3,000 contributions to GitLab. These contributors include team members from global organizations like Thales and Scania, who are helping shape GitLab&rsquo;s future through the Co-Create Program ‚Äî GitLab&rsquo;s collaborative development program where customers work directly with GitLab engineers to contribute meaningful features to the platform.</p>
<p>Through workshops, pair programming sessions, and ongoing support, program participants get hands-on experience with GitLab&rsquo;s architecture and codebase while solving issues or improving existing features.</p>
