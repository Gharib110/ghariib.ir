		<p>Valve will be releasing a beta of SteamOS that you can install on your devices, and it&rsquo;s coming soon.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is well underway, and one surprise that came from the show was confirmation from Valve that the company wants SteamOS to run on everything. It&rsquo;s been <em>kind of</em> expected for a while, but a direct confirmation of it along with a promise for more devices to come with it isn&rsquo;t necessarily something most people had on their bingo cards for the show. What it means is that you&rsquo;ll be able to install SteamOS on your PC or your gaming handheld, without a need to worry about dealing with Windows.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering if you should upgrade your graphics card, you should see these signs that it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The graphics card on your PC does all the heavy lifting when you play your favorite games. Therefore, it&rsquo;s one of the first components you should consider upgrading to improve your PC&rsquo;s gaming performance. Unlike smartphones, though, most users don&rsquo;t upgrade their PCs every two years or so. In fact, I try to hold on to my graphics card for as long as I can. But how do you know when it&rsquo;s time to get a new one? Look out for these signs.</p>

		<p>Reflecting on 2024, it has been an eventful year for the Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting team. Throughout the year, we identified numerous threat actor campaigns exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, uncovered additional variants of these vulnerabilities, and discovered even more vulnerabilities through our in-the-wild research. In this blog, we will highlight some of the key achievements of the Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting team, as well as discuss important in-the-wild vulnerability trends and industry challenges we encountered in 2024 which will continue into 2025</p>

<h2 id="-about">ü§ó About</h2>
<p>2024 was an incredible year filled with challenges, achievements, and an abundance of - sometimes unexpected - <strong>learning opportunities that came to me on my way.</strong></p>
<p>Reflecting on the year, here are <strong>some of the highlights</strong> that shaped my growth as a professional and as a person.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed the most this year is the fact that <strong>I could transform real life problems into nicely well packaged IT projects</strong> that could satisfy my own curiosity and then be shared with the community.</p>

		<p>The New Year always brings fresh energy‚Äînew resolutions, new challenges, and a sense of hope. January arrives with a smile, a renewed spirit, and the perfect time to define our goals for the year ahead.</p>
<p>In my personal and professional life, I‚Äôve been using two tools: The Wellness Wheel and Year Compass. These frameworks have helped me decide which areas of my life I want to improve. I like the idea of <em>‚Äúlife areas‚Äù</em> because they include more than just work‚Äîfamily, friends, health, recreation, and other important parts of life are included too.</p>

		<p>At Tuta our focus is to keep our users&rsquo; data secure with quantum-safe encryption. To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords and the password length are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But given new threats of quantum computers, what is the optimal minimum password length recommended by NIST and CISA?</p>
