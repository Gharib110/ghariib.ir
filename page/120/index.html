		<p>A sophisticated cyber campaign orchestrated by the threat group TAG-124 has compromised over 1,000 WordPress websites to deploy malicious payloads.</p>
<p>The operation leverages a multi-layered Traffic Distribution System (TDS) to infect users with malware, demonstrating advanced evasion tactics and infrastructure management.</p>
<p>TAG-124’s infrastructure consists of compromised WordPress sites injected with malicious JavaScript to redirect visitors to attacker-controlled payload servers.</p>

		<p>The sudden rise of DeepSeek has raised concerns and questions, especially about the origin and destination of the training data, as well as the security of the data.</p>
<p>For those returning from a short holiday away from the news, DeepSeek is a new player on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. The Chinese startup has certainly taken the app stores by storm: In just a week after the launch it topped the charts as the most downloaded free app in the US. This caused an upset on the stock markets that cost nVidia and Oracle shareholders a lot of money.</p>

<p>Over the years, Apple has continuously refined its security mechanisms to deter unauthorized access to their devices. One of the most significant aspects of this evolution is the increasingly sophisticated passcode protection system in iOS devices. This article explores how the delay between failed passcode attempts has evolved over time, highlighting changes that have made iOS screen lock protection more secure.</p>
<h2 id="early-stages">Early Stages</h2>
<p>In the early days of iOS, passcode attempts were practically unlimited. The delay between failed attempts would increase over time, but in extreme cases, the wait time could reach absurd numbers -sometimes even displaying “Next attempt in 100 million years.” There are plenty of screenshots of these exaggerated lockout periods available on the net.</p>

<p>A successful Operation Talent, led by Europol and German authorities, has culminated in the seizure of two major hacking forums and the arrest of related suspects. ‘Cracked’ and ‘Nulled’ forums were notorious for acting as a central hub for cybercrime, hosting AI-based security scanners, stolen databases, and hacking scripts, as well as supporting illegal activities like credential stuffing, malware distribution, and the sale of cracked software. The forums hosted over 10 million users between them before the takedown.</p>

<p>The evolution of cyber security is no longer just about reacting to threats; it is about staying perpetually ahead in a world defined by complexity and speed. Autonomous cyber security represents a bold, transformative leap into the future—where intelligent, AI-driven systems operate at the edge of innovation, detecting, preventing, and responding to threats with unparalleled precision. This journey is more than technological advancement—it is a paradigm shift. By creating systems that think, reason, and act autonomously, organizations are poised to outpace adversaries and redefine what it means to be secure in an increasingly digitized world. The further along this journey […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>See which reasons are the only valid ones for upgrading your gaming PC.</p>
<p>Whenever a new generation of CPUs or GPUs drops, PC users are susceptible to a wave of FOMO clouding their rational thinking. From the announcement livestreams and preview benchmarks to third-party reviews and stock issues, everyone gets swept up in the hype. On the one hand, this is what we look forward to every year or two, but on the other hand, a fancy new product doesn&rsquo;t magically make your existing PC trash.</p>
