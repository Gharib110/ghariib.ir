		<p>You probably have a lot of games you love on the Game Boy, but have you tried these? Give them a shot.</p>
<p>Nintendo&rsquo;s Game Boy is an absolutely iconic handheld console that many of us look back on fondly (that&rsquo;s probably why Nintendo is making a Lego version of it). While I didn&rsquo;t grow up with a Game Boy myself, I have played a few games on the platform and I know there&rsquo;s quite a lot to love on it.</p>

		<p>In order to stay competitive, AMD needs to step it up with these things.</p>
<p>The last two weeks have been all about Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 50 series launch — the company&rsquo;s performance claims, the actual rasterized gen-on-gen gains, and the &ldquo;fake vs. real frames&rdquo; debate. It&rsquo;s also been about the notable absence of AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 4 graphics cards from its CES keynote. The company&rsquo;s RX 9000 GPUs were a no-show at CES, which AMD tried to justify. Many people believe the company might not be confident in its offerings.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Humans make mistakes all the time. All of us do, every day, in tasks both new and routine. Some of our mistakes are minor and some are catastrophic. Mistakes can break trust with our friends, lose the confidence of our bosses, and sometimes be the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, we have created security systems to deal with the sorts of mistakes humans commonly make. These days, casinos rotate their dealers regularly, because they make mistakes if they do the same task for too long. Hospital personnel write on limbs before surgery so that doctors operate on the correct body part, and they count surgical instruments to make sure none were left inside the body. From copyediting to double-entry bookkeeping to appellate courts, we humans have gotten really good at correcting human mistakes&hellip;</p>

		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is writing law today. This has required no changes in legislative procedure or the rules of legislative bodies—all it takes is one legislator, or legislative assistant, to use generative AI in the process of drafting a bill.</p>
<p>In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and legislatures around the world to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy research and analysis, and more.

<p>Some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents­—namely, the security failures of federal contractors.</p>
<p>The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on a mandate that debuted in 2022 in response to &hellip;</p>

		<p>For businesses that handle sensitive customer information, achieving SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) compliance is not just a good practice — it&rsquo;s often a necessity. SOC 2 is a rigorous auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that assesses a service organization&rsquo;s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</p>
<p>While SOC 2 is not legally mandated, it has become increasingly important, in part due to breaches consistently seen in news headlines. Obtaining SOC 2 compliance allows customers to build trust with service organizations because they know their data is being properly stored and security controls have been assessed by a third party.</p>
