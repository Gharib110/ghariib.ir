<p>2023 was dynamic year for ATT&amp;CK. We marked a decade of progress since the framework’s inception and achieved some key milestones to make ATT&amp;CK more accessible for a wider community. Our scope (slightly) expanded to encompass activities adjacent to direct Enterprise interactions, such as non-technical, deceptive practices and social engineering techniques (Financial Theft, Impersonation, and Spearphishing Voice). We enhanced detection capabilities with integrated notes, pseudocode from CAR, and BZAR-based analytics. The ICS matrix welcomed the addition of Assets to enhance inter-sector communication and mapping. We rolled out Mobile-specific data sources, structured detections, and behaviors like smishing, quishing, and vishing. Website navigation was improved, along with a faster Search bar, and updates that hit you faster than you can say “resources/changelog.html”. We also maintained a steady cadence of updates and new content from the ATT&amp;CK team and external contributors.</p>

<p>Right on cue, ATT&amp;CK’s latest release is out, and this time we’ve gone to v11! If you’ve been following along with our roadmap there shouldn’t be any huge surprises in store, but we wanted to take a chance to go over our latest changes. The v11 set list includes detections now paired with related Data Sources: Data Components, a beta version of sub-techniques for ATT&amp;CK for Mobile, ATT&amp;CK for ICS on attack.mitre.org, as well as regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, and Groups.</p>

<p>It’s not like a regular Tuesday, it’s a lucky Tuesday — ATT&amp;CK v13 has arrived. As we outlined in our Roadmap, we’re working toward enhanced tools for lower-resourced defenders, improving ATT&amp;CK’s website usability, enhancing ICS and Mobile parity with Enterprise, and evolving overall content and structure this year. ATT&amp;CK v13 is bringing some analytics pseudocode, Mobile-specific data sources, key website updates, ICS Asset refactoring, and more Cloud and Linux coverage. For the rest of our regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our release notes, our (new) detailed changelog, or our (new) changelog.json.</p>

<p>ATT&amp;CK has been brewing up something eerie for this Halloween — a release so hauntingly powerful that it will send a chill down the spine of even the most formidable adversaries. As v14 emerges from the depths, we’re proud to present a more robust and finely-tuned knowledge base. So, grab your flashlights and keep your wits about you as you navigate the latest changes, including enhanced detection guidance for many techniques, a (slightly) expanded scope on Enterprise and Mobile, Assets in ICS, and Mobile Structured Detections.</p>

<p>v15 is all about actionability and bringing defenders’ reality into focus — we prioritized <em>what</em> you need to detect, and <em>how</em> you can do it more effectively with detection engineering upgrades, and deeper intelligence insights across platforms. This release also reflects the new expansion rhythm, balancing both well-known and emerging behaviors to reflect how trends and activity are experienced in the field.</p>
