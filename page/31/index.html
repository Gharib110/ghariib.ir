<p>For most of history, the world got along fine without the rare earth elements. We knew they existed, we knew they weren’t really all that rare, and we really didn’t have much use for them — until we discovered just how useful they are and made ourselves absolutely dependent on them, to the point where not having them would literally grind the world to a halt.</p>
<p>This dependency has spurred a search for caches of rare earth elements in the strangest of places, from muddy sediments on the sea floor to asteroids. But there’s one potential source that’s much closer to home: coal ash waste. According to a study from the University of Texas Austin, the 5 gigatonnes of coal ash produced in the United States between 1950 and 2021 might contain as much as $8.4 billion worth of REEYSc — that’s the 16 lanthanide rare earth elements plus yttrium and scandium, transition metals that aren’t strictly rare earths but are geologically associated with them and useful in many of the same ways.</p>

		<p>Treating exposures as full and complete can help you respond more effectively to focus on what truly matters: securing systems, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining the trust of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The post Full exposure: A practical approach to handling sensitive data leaks appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p><em>This post originally appeared in Infosecurity Magazine, and is republished here with permission.</em></p>
<p>In the fast-paced world of software development, accidents can happen—even to the best of us. One such unfortunate event is the accidental leakage of sensitive data such as private or internal source code. When this occurs, companies often find themselves in a frantic rush to assess the situation, leading them down the rabbit hole of trying to determine just how exposed their sensitive data really is. However, this quest for degrees of exposure is a futile endeavor. There’s no such thing as “just a little bit exposed.” Instead, it’s better to opt for the more pragmatic approach: treat the exposure as full and complete from the moment it happens.</p>

		<p>There’s been remarkable growth in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) in a short period of time recently, and it can be difficult to know when or where to start or how to keep up with it all. One of the distinct advantages of using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is that you don’t have to spend your own mental cycles to cut through the AI noise. By its nature, RHEL puts technology that’s useful and reliable to good use, so you can use RHEL as both a gateway and a platform for emerging-but-proven AI use cases. Here’s how you can use RHEL to get up to speed with AI.What’s the bus</p>

</p>
<p>Securing containerized applications demands a multi-layered strategy that spans the entire lifecycle from development to production, a challenge Aqua has spent nearly a decade mastering. Aqua’s Container Security solution provides full lifecycle protection by identifying vulnerabilities early in the build phase, integrating acceptance gates in the CI/CD pipeline to minimize risks, and offering real-time runtime protection in production environments. With the Aqua Platform, organizations can secure container workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, stop attacks as they happen, and maintain compliance, all without slowing development.</p>
