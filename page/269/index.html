		<p>How are you going to let a newcomer show you up on their second kick at the can?</p>
<p>For years now, the king of the graphics card castle has been obvious. NVIDIA is and continues to be the gold standard for graphics cards, and AMD’s Radeon cards could just never quite stack up. The bad news doesn’t end there; Intel’s recent launch of their B580 GPU makes matters much worse. In only their second launch, Intel has done what AMD hasn’t been able to do for generations: create a graphics card that will fly off the shelves. The B580, despite its continued teething issues, is out of stock basically everywhere and shows exactly how AMD can’t keep pointing the finger elsewhere for its poor management of the Radeon division.</p>

		<p>Like many other data brokers, Gravy is a company you may never have heard of, but it almost certainly knows a lot about you if you’re a US citizen.</p>
<p>Data brokers come in different shapes and sizes. What they have in common is that they gather personally identifiable data from various sources—from publicly available data to stolen datasets—and then sell the gathered data on. Gravy Analytics specializes in location intelligence, meaning it collects sensitive phone location and behavior data.</p>

</p>
<p>For scripting, Scribus 1.6.3 added <strong>three Python script functions</strong> for working with points and the document unit. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pointsToDocUnit</code> – Returns a value in the measurement units of the document converted from points.</li>
<li><code>docUnitToPoints</code> – Returns a value in points converted from the measurement units of the document.</li>
<li><code>stringValueToPoints</code> – Returns a value in points converted from a string value (”5mm”, ”2in” etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>It also added script method <code>getBaseLine()</code> to complement <code>setBaseLine()</code>, improved autotypo script for french typographic rules. And, it fixed incorrect page size used by <code>ImageExport() -&gt; save()</code>, as well as the issue the Scripter’s ImageExporter ignores actual quality setting.</p>

		<p>Valve broke new ground with the Steam Deck that launched PC handhelds into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>When Valve launched the Steam Machines in 2015, it was hardly to any kind of acclaim. It was an interesting idea: creating a Linux-based PC to provide a console-like gaming experience. SteamOS was in its infancy here, and while the Steam Machines flopped, Valve wasn’t done with trying to bring their own platform to market.</p>

		<p>Your home server&rsquo;s data isn&rsquo;t backed up unless you have an offsite storage solution.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a home server, you probably already have your devices backing up their data to your storage pools. But that&rsquo;s not the only place you should be storing backups, as the 3-2-1 backup rule means you should have one copy of your data at an offsite location. That could be a cloud storage service or a physical machine that&rsquo;s further away than your garage, but for any truly important data, it&rsquo;s a necessary cost to keep it safe.</p>

		<p>As the virtualization space evolves, many customers need to update their traditional virtualization strategies. Organizations are choosing to adopt a virtualization strategy to avoid the rising costs of managing legacy systems and the inability to scale to meet business demands1. A feature of Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization allows users to run and manage virtual machine workloads alongside containers. It supports both hybrid and multicloud environments and provides one unified platform for virtual machines and containers.Migrating to OpenShift Virtualization offers the flex</p>

<p>Bluetooth is a good way to connect devices that are near each other. However, it can drain batteries which is one reason Bluetooth Low Energy — BLE — exists. [Drmph] shows how easy it is to deploy BLE to make, in this case, a doorbell. He even shows how you can refit an existing doorbell to use the newer technology.</p>
<p>Like many projects, this one started out of necessity. The existing wireless doorbell failed, but it was difficult to find a new unit with good review. Cheap doorbells tend to ring spuriously due to interference. BLE, of course, doesn’t have that problem. Common BLE modules make up the bulk of the project. It is easy enough to add your own style to the doorbell like a voice announcement or musical playback. The transmitter is little more than a switch, the module, a coin cell, and an LED.</p>
