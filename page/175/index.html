		<p>In order to stay competitive, AMD needs to step it up with these things.</p>
<p>The last two weeks have been all about Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 50 series launch — the company&rsquo;s performance claims, the actual rasterized gen-on-gen gains, and the &ldquo;fake vs. real frames&rdquo; debate. It&rsquo;s also been about the notable absence of AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 4 graphics cards from its CES keynote. The company&rsquo;s RX 9000 GPUs were a no-show at CES, which AMD tried to justify. Many people believe the company might not be confident in its offerings.</p>

<p>In this third and final part of the series, I’ll provide some tips on how to set up your roadmap and effectively demonstrate compliance without overburdening your teams. </p>
<p>If you’re just joining the fun now, in our two previous editions we covered who NIS2 applies to and what requirements it sets out. Be sure to have a look at them if you need any additional context. </p>

	<div>
		<p>Humans make mistakes all the time. All of us do, every day, in tasks both new and routine. Some of our mistakes are minor and some are catastrophic. Mistakes can break trust with our friends, lose the confidence of our bosses, and sometimes be the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, we have created security systems to deal with the sorts of mistakes humans commonly make. These days, casinos rotate their dealers regularly, because they make mistakes if they do the same task for too long. Hospital personnel write on limbs before surgery so that doctors operate on the correct body part, and they count surgical instruments to make sure none were left inside the body. From copyediting to double-entry bookkeeping to appellate courts, we humans have gotten really good at correcting human mistakes&hellip;</p>

		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is writing law today. This has required no changes in legislative procedure or the rules of legislative bodies—all it takes is one legislator, or legislative assistant, to use generative AI in the process of drafting a bill.</p>
<p>In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and legislatures around the world to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy research and analysis, and more.

		<p>President Biden has signed a new cybersecurity order. It has a bunch of provisions, most notably using the US governments procurement power to improve cybersecurity practices industry-wide.</p>
<p>Some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents­—namely, the security failures of federal contractors.</p>
<p>The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on a mandate that debuted in 2022 in response to &hellip;</p>

		<p>For businesses that handle sensitive customer information, achieving SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) compliance is not just a good practice — it&rsquo;s often a necessity. SOC 2 is a rigorous auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that assesses a service organization&rsquo;s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</p>
<p>While SOC 2 is not legally mandated, it has become increasingly important, in part due to breaches consistently seen in news headlines. Obtaining SOC 2 compliance allows customers to build trust with service organizations because they know their data is being properly stored and security controls have been assessed by a third party.</p>

		<p>DevSecOps streamlines software development by allowing teams to ship features quickly and providing short feedback cycles for customers. These short feedback cycles can be used to monitor the impact of a feature from the time it is shipped and to inform developers and product managers about the success or failure of a given deployment.</p>
<p>GitLab, as an agnostic DevSecOps platform, can act as an integration point for different CI/CD tools that often contribute to user-facing functionality. For example, the vulnerability report, which displays all detected vulnerabilities, is visible as a single functionality, but the data in the report may come from a number of different tools in various pipelines.</p>

<p>Linux Kernel 6.13 is released! Linus Torvalds announced it in lkml.org on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week, so I’ve tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release.</em></p>
<p>It’s mostly some final driver fixes (gpu and networking dominating – normal), with some doc updates too. And various little stuff all over. The shortlog is appended for people who want to see the details (and, as always, it’s just the shortlog for the last week, the full 6.13 log is obviously much too big).</p>
