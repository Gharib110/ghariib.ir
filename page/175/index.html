		<p>The worlds of user experience (UX) design and open source technology are increasingly converging. At Red Hat, where open source fuels innovation, this synergy is reshaping how designers and developers collaborate to create impactful tools and workflows. For many UX designers, including myself, the idea of stepping into technical realms like using command line interfaces (CLIs), opening an issue on GitHub, or diving into codebases can feel intimidating and out of reach. But the most impactful opportunities lie within these technical spaces. These opportunities to create new tools and workflows empower users and bridge the gap between design and development.</p>

	<b><time>23.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In programming, it’s common to come across 0, null, and undefined. These three values might seem similar at first glance, but they serve different purposes and behave differently in code. Let’s explore what each means and how they work, with simple examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-zero-0">What is Zero (0)?</h2>
<p>The value 0 represents a number, specifically the smallest non-negative number. It is a defined value and is treated as a number in JavaScript.</p>
