<h3 id="the-year-in-review">The Year in Review</h3>
<p>Time flies. Only a year ago, we saw the release of Scala 3.4.0-RC1, and now we’re trying out Scala 3.6.2 with many new experimental features. The last 12 months have brought many new features to the IntelliJ Scala Plugin as well. A year ago we introduced X-Ray mode, which lets you easily augment the code you see in the editor with information about inferred types and other details. We’ve improved Scala 3 support, compiler-based highlighting, and the debugger. We’ve improved auto-completion, both the standard and the AI-powered versions. We’ve introduced support for named tuples, which are still an experimental feature, and we’ve implemented a new way to work with sbt projects. On top of all that, this year, JetBrains joined the Scala Advisory Board. You can read about those changes in our release notes and other blog posts:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We made it – this far! The U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently published the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, marking the end of the beginning of the journey to quantum resiliency. In this blog post, we will briefly recap how we arrived at this point, take a quick look at the standardized algorithms, and point out a few areas of future work and challenges.</p>

		<p>For the last few weeks, SAFECode has been discussing a number of government initiatives related to software security assurance. This is the first of several blogs that we will be publishing to share our perspective and recommendations for approaches that will help governments and other organizations gain confidence in the software that they acquire and use.</p>
<p>Since the release of Executive Order (EO) 14028 in 2021, SAFECode has been tracking the U.S. Government’s plans and statements about how the portions of the EO dealing with secure software development and supply chain security would be put into action. This brief paper provides a SAFECode perspective on attestation that we believe will be important for software development organizations, end users, and government policymakers.</p>
