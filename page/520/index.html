		<p>Open-source software (OSS) has become an indispensable component in many industrial environments. Just last year, 95% of companies said they increased or maintained their use of OSS. According to the Linux Foundation, 70-80% of all code in any modern solution has been directly plucked from OSS solutions,. Cost-efficiency, flexibility, and expansive development community make OSS an attractive option for many organizations looking to innovate while managing budgets. It&rsquo;s also a boon for anyone looking for transparency over pure performance. However, these apparent strengths can mask significant&hellip;</p>

<p>In response to the scale and complexity of modern cloud-native technology, organizations are increasingly reliant on automation to properly manage their infrastructure and workflows. DevOps automation eliminates extraneous manual processes, enabling DevOps teams to develop, test, deliver, deploy, and execute other key processes at scale. Automation thus contributes to accelerated productivity and innovation across the organization.</p>
<p>Automation can be particularly powerful when applied to DevOps workflows. According to the Dynatrace 2023 DevOps Automation Pulse report, an average of 56% of end-to-end DevOps processes are automated across organizations of all kinds.</p>

<p>Over the course of the 1990s we saw huge developments in the world of PC graphics cards, going from little more than the original IBM VGA standard through super VGA and then so-called “Windows accelerator” cards which brought the kind of hardware acceleration the console and 16 bit home computer users had been used to for a while. At the end of the decade we had the first generation of 3D accelerator chipsets which are ancestors of today’s GPUs.</p>

<p>Let’s get it straight: it is wrong to have more than one application container inside a single Pod. There are different reasons behind this statement and I will mention just a few of them. In any cases, the way Kubernetes has been designed brings us to the fact that having just one application container per Pod gives us a lot more flexibility.</p>

<p>The advent of agile methodologies has certainly been a phenomenon similar to the revolution of the 1960s. I believe that it’s some sort of Woodstock of information, which, as often happens in life, I only saw from afar.</p>
<p>However, I continue to meet people who were there and who always stop to tell me that such an event will never happen again <strong>and how the programmers of the past loved each other</strong>, exchanged flower crowns, etc. Well, in short, the Robert Downey Jr. meme fits perfectly.</p>
