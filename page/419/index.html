	<div>
		<p>How the Nearest Neighbor tactic can be used in remote attacks on an organization&rsquo;s wireless network — and how to protect yourself against this threat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of information security, wireless networks are typically perceived as something that can be accessed only locally — to connect to them, an attacker needs to be physically close to the access point. This significantly limits their use in attacks on organizations, and so they are perceived as relatively risk-free. It’s easy to think that some random hacker on the internet could never simply connect to a corporate Wi-Fi network. However, the newly emerged Nearest Neighbor attack tactic demonstrates that this perception is not entirely accurate.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Telco cloud</strong> has evolved from the much hyped (but commercially failed) <strong>NFV/Virtual Network Functions or VNFs</strong> and classical <strong>SDN architectures,</strong> to today’s more robust platforms for <strong>managing virtualized and cloud-native network functions</strong> that are tailored to the needs of telecom network workloads. This shift is bringing many new participants to the rapidly evolving <strong>telco cloud</strong> [<strong>1.]</strong> landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1.</strong>  In this instance, “<strong>telco cloud</strong>” means running telco network functions, including <strong>5G SA Core network</strong> on a public, private, or hybrid cloud platform. It does <strong>NOT</strong> imply that telcos are going to be cloud service providers (CSPs) and compete with Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM, Alibaba and other established CSPs.  Telcos gave up on that years ago and sold most of their own data centers which they intended to make cloud resident.</p>

		<p>On Christmas Eve, 2023, the Ohio State Lottery had to shut down some of its systems because of a cyberattack. Around the same time, the Dark Web had a “Leaksmas” event, where cyber criminals shared stolen information for free as a holiday gift. In fact, the month of December 2023 saw more than 2 billion records breached and 1,351 disclosed security incidents, according to research from IT Governance — an increase of 332% and 187%, respectively, over the month of November.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Pallet liquidation scams target people looking to purchase pallets of supposedly discounted merchandise, often from major retailers like Amazon.</p>
<p>Groups that engage in pallet liquidation sales are rampant on social media and it’s hard to discern the scammers from the legitimate ones (to be honest, I’ve always thought they were all scams, until someone told me there are legitimate ones), let alone the grey area in between.</p>
<p>The scams are based on the fact that many products are returned and can not be sold again for various reasons. But companies also offer overstock and out-of-season apparel for sale. Most of these companies have the first buyers sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) so when you scroll through different legitimate liquidation websites and marketplaces the origin of the pallet is almost never stated.</p>
