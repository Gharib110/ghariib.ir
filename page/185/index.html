		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Multi-Key Homomorphic Secret Sharing</strong><br>
<em>Geoffroy Couteau, Lalita Devadas, Aditya Hegde, Abhishek Jain, Sacha Servan-Schreiber</em></p>
<p>Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) is a distributed analogue of fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE), where subsequent to an input-sharing phase, parties can locally compute a function over their shares to obtain shares of the function output.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, HSS schemes have been constructed from an array of different assumptions. However, all schemes require a public-key or correlated-randomness setup. This limitation carries over to the applications of HSS.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In mid-November 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the Russian threat actor we track as Star Blizzard sending their typical targets spear-phishing messages, this time offering the supposed opportunity to join a WhatsApp group. This is the first time we have identified a shift in Star Blizzard’s longstanding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to leverage a new access vector. Star Blizzard’s targets are most commonly related to government or diplomacy (both incumbent and former position holders), defense policy or international relations researchers whose work touches on Russia, and sources of assistance to Ukraine related to the war with Russia.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Non-Interactive Distributed Point Functions</strong><br>
<em>Elette Boyle, Lalita Devadas, Sacha Servan-Schreiber</em></p>
<p>Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) are a useful cryptographic primitive enabling a dealer to distribute short keys to two parties, such that the keys encode additive secret shares of a secret point function. However, in many applications of DPFs, no single dealer entity has full knowledge of the secret point function, necessitating the parties to run an interactive protocol to emulate the setup. Prior works have aimed to minimize complexity metrics of such distributed setup protocols, e.g., round complexity, while remaining black-box in the underlying cryptography.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On Gaussian Sampling for $q$-ary Lattices and Linear Codes with Lee Weight</strong><br>
<em>Maiara F. Bollauf, Maja Lie, Cong Ling</em></p>
<p>We show that discrete Gaussian sampling for a $q$-ary lattice is equivalent to codeword sampling for a linear code over $mathbb{Z}_q$ with the Lee weight. This insight allows us to derive the theta series of a $q$-ary lattice from the Lee weight distribution of the associated code. We design a novel Gaussian sampler for $q$-ary lattices assuming an oracle that computes the symmetrized weight enumerator of the associated code. We apply this sampler to well-known lattices, such as the $E_8$, Barnes-Wall, and Leech lattice, highlighting both its advantages and limitations, which depend on the underlying code properties. For certain root lattices, we show that the sampler is indeed efficient, forgoing the need to assume an oracle. We also discuss applications of our results in digital signature schemes and the Lattice Isomorphism Problem. In many cases, our sampler achieves a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art sampling algorithms in cryptographic applications.</p>

<p>The OWASP Global AppSec Dublin 2023 conference was a truly inspiring event for anyone involved in application security. As an attendee, I was able to catch up with OWASP colleagues and hear from experts on a range of topics. </p>
<p>In particular, there were two themes that really stood out to me: <em>worldwide</em> and <em>threat modeling</em>.</p>
<h4 id="owasp-the-open-worldwide-application-security-project">OWASP: The Open Worldwide Application Security Project</h4>
<p>During the conference, the OWASP Board made an exciting announcement regarding the meaning of the letter &ldquo;W&rdquo; in OWASP. Traditionally, the &ldquo;W&rdquo; in OWASP has stood for &ldquo;Web,&rdquo; reflecting the organization&rsquo;s initial focus on web application security. The Board announced they are changing the meaning of the &ldquo;W&rdquo; to &ldquo;Worldwide,&rdquo; reflecting the global nature of the OWASP project and its mission.</p>
