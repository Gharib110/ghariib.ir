		<p>In a compelling keynote address at the 2024 Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit, Jon Smart, former head of ways of working at Barclays and author of <em>Sooner, Safer, Happier</em>, revealed surprising parallels between historical management innovations and modern enterprise challenges. Drawing from extensive research spanning nearly two centuries of industrial evolution, Smart unveiled three critical patterns that continue to shape—and challenge—organizational effectiveness today.</p>
<p>Smart’s presentation, based on his analysis of over 60 historical publications dating from 1776 to 1950, highlighted how modern organizations repeatedly struggle with lessons that were first learned during previous technological revolutions. His research, part of an upcoming book on the centuries-long evolution of working methods, demonstrates that despite technological advancement, core management principles remain remarkably consistent across eras.</p>

<h2 id="innovative-ai-tools-in-scientific-research"><strong>Innovative AI tools in scientific research</strong></h2>
<p>In today’s rapidly evolving world, <strong>AI</strong> is not just transforming industries but also unlocking new opportunities for innovation across almost all sectors, including research. One such opportunity in scientific research is to create an objective method for evaluating the originality of research: an AI-powered tool for novelty scores. By assessing the novelty of studies, i.e. how surprising and innovative yet sensible these studies are, these scores enable industries such as pharmaceutical research &amp; development to quickly identify and gauge areas for innovation more efficiently. This helps significantly speed up the traditional peer review processes. Professor Philipp Koellinger, Co-Founder and CEO of the preprint start-up DeSci Labs, explores how embracing AI in scientific publishing can accelerate progress and drive meaningful advancements across multiple industries.</p>

<p>GenAI is everywhere, and it’s changing how we approach technology. If you’ve ever wanted to dive into the world of large language models (LLMs) but felt intimidated, there’s good news! Hugging Face recently launched a self-paced course that’s perfect for beginners and more experienced enthusiasts alike. It’s hands-on, approachable, and designed to work on standard hardware thanks to the small footprint of the models.</p>
<p>As soon as I heard the news, I decided to give it a go using Canonical’s Data Science Stack (DSS).</p>

		<p>In a previous blog post, we introduced the IAM Access Analyzer custom policy check feature, which allows you to validate your policies against custom rules. Now we’re taking a step further and bringing these policy checks directly into your development environment with the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (VS Code).</p>
<p>In this blog post, we show how you can integrate IAM Access Analyzer custom policy check capability into VS Code, so you can identify overly permissive IAM policies and fine-tune access controls early in the development process. This proactive approach to security and compliance helps to ensure that your IAM policies are validated before they are deployed, reducing the risk of introducing misconfigurations or granting unintended access. It also saves developer time by providing fast feedback to developers when they write a policy that does not meet organizational standards.</p>
