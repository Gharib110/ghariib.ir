<p>Supply chain security is a rising concern in the current software era. Securing the software supply chain encompasses vulnerability remediation and the implementation of controls throughout the software development process. Due to massive increase in attacks on software supply chain and the diversity of its types, Jenkins X has to make efforts to ensure that the build process is secure. As part of securing Jenkins X installation by default I worked on both securing our own components and enabling our users to use these features in their build and release steps..</p>

<p>A standard part of the Jenkins X pipelines since a long time is the execution of <code>jx changelog create</code> that takes the commit messages between the release currently being created and the previous one and creates a change log from these. The change log is then stored as a release note in GitHub or other git provider.</p>
<p>During the last year some improvements have landed in various Jenkins X components to improve the changelogs and their usefulness. So I‚Äôll take this opportunity to describe these improvements and also in general give hints to how to get useful changelogs.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries, tools, and processes used in those stages.</p>

	<div>
		<p>To allow Jenkins X to support Kubernetes 1.22, we had to update our version of Tekton. This updated version of Tekton contains breaking changes that has consequences if you made your own custom Jenkins X pipelines.</p>
<p>To make sure that your custom pipelines continue to work after this upgrade, you must edit the resource settings in your pipelines. Otherwise your pipelines will most likely not be able to start at all, or if they do, consume a lot of resources.</p>

		<p>Google has announced that container registry will be shut down some time after March 18, 2025. For GKE clusters created with version 1.12.0 or later of terraform-google-jx it‚Äôs unlikely that anything needs to be done, but for older clusters you should upgrade your cluster while considering our advice regarding migration from container registry to artifact registry.</p>
<p>If you are using a Google Service Account to run terraform you need to add the role requirement roles/artifactregistry.admin. See our guide regarding Google Service Account for details.</p>

		<p>We have put together some project ideas as part of our application to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2023 program.</p>
<h3 id="1-cd-events-integration-with-jenkins-x">1. CD events integration with Jenkins X</h3>
<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The cdEvents project standardises the way systems talk to each other, which enables Interoperability between systems so they speak a common language through the cdEvents spec in the event. Creating a capability in Jenkins X that can receive and sent a cdEvent would benefit the project and the DevOps ecosystem in general, by stopping glue code used to integrate systems and power innovation by letting end users swap out tools with no effort.</p>

		<p>Since the dawn of Jenkins X 3 the default last step of reconciling the state of the files in your cluster repository to your cluster has been to execute <code>kubectl apply</code>. You can find more details about this here.</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks with <code>kubectl apply</code> though. The one that made me start looking for alternatives was that if you remove a resource from your cluster repository it may not be removed from your cluster. The way deletion works with <code>kubectl apply</code> is that it is handed the option <code>--prune</code> which will remove resources that are not in the manifests. Except that it doesn‚Äôt always work as expected. It will only remove certain kinds of resources defined in kubectl. In my case I removed an HorizontalPodAutoscaler from my cluster repository, but it wasn‚Äôt removed from my cluster.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt understand what is Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), please read this blog post first.</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-formats-comparison">Different SBOM formats comparison</h2>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U.S. defined minimum requirements for SBOM formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying the supplier of the software component.</li>
<li>Identifying the details about the version of the component.</li>
<li>Including unique identifiers for the component like cryptographic hash functions.</li>
<li>Including the relationships between all dependencies inside the component.</li>
<li>Including a timestamp of when and by whom the SBOM report was created or last modified</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we discuss different kinds and formats for SBOM standards and make a brief comparison between them. Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document.</p>
