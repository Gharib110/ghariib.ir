		<p>HTML and CSS are the most fundamental building blocks of a webpage, and they are also your first step towards becoming a web developer. HTML provides the layout and content of the webpage, and CSS defines its style and appearance. In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basics of HTML and CSS, and by the end, you will be able to design responsive webpages that work seamlessly on devices of all sizes.</p>

		<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Due to a discrepancy in Git behavior, partial parts of a source code repository are visible when making copies via the “git clone” command. There are additional parts of the repository that only become visible when using the “–mirror” option. This can lead to secrets being exposed via git repositories when not removed properly, and a false sense of security when repositories are scanned for secrets against a cloned, non-mirrored copy.</p>

		<p>No one likes ads, but the free Gmail - a very popular email provider - continues to ignore its users demands at this crucial point. While seemingly the perfect email solution with lots of features and plenty of storage, Gmail shows more advertisements to its users than most email services. This advertising must be stopped!</p>

<p>Good news this week from the Sun’s far side as the Parker Solar Probe checked in after its speedrun through our star’s corona. Parker became the fastest human-made object ever — aside from the manhole cover, of course — as it fell into the Sun’s gravity well on Christmas Eve to pass within 6.1 million kilometers of the surface, in an attempt to study the extremely dynamic environment of the solar atmosphere. Similar to how manned spacecraft returning to Earth are blacked out from radio communications, the plasma soup Parker flew through meant everything it would do during the pass had to be autonomous, and we wouldn’t know how it went until the probe cleared the high-energy zone. The probe pinged Earth with a quick “I’m OK” message on December 26, and checked in with the Deep Space Network as scheduled on January 1, dumping telemetry data that indicated the spacecraft not only survived its brush with the corona but that every instrument performed as expected during the pass. The scientific data from the instruments won’t be downloaded until the probe is in a little better position, and then Parker will get to do the whole thing again twice more in 2025.</p>

		<p>While external cyberattacks often make the headlines, internal security risks (aka insider risks) present a significant danger that is sometimes underestimated. These risks can arise from disgruntled employees, negligent insiders, or malicious actors with privileged access. The repercussions of such breaches can be severe, resulting in data loss, financial harm, legal fines, and harm to reputation.</p>
<p>Effectively managing internal security threats requires a careful and balanced approach. Implementing overly strict measures can hinder creativity and dampen current employee morale, yet having weak security protocols can leave organizations open to exploitation. This article delves into the various facets of internal threats, exploring the potential outcomes and examining the essential elements of a strong internal security plan.</p>

<p>There are already many backend libraries and frameworks for Node.js on the market. I&rsquo;ve used Nest.js for some small projects before. It has comprehensive functions and enables rapid project implementation. However, for my small projects, many of its features are really overkill, and it has a high level of encapsulation, leaving little freedom when writing code.</p>
<p>By chance, I came across Hono online. After reading its documentation:</p>
