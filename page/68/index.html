		<p>A paradigm shift in technology is hurtling towards us, and it could change everything we know about cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Uhh, again, that is.</p>
<p>When ChatGPT was unveiled to the public in late 2022, security experts looked on with cautious optimism, excited about the new technology but concerned about its use in cyberattacks. But two years on, much of what ChatGPT and other generative AI chat tools offer attackers is a way to improve what already works, not new ways to deliver attacks themselves.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;new Outlook&rdquo; (introduced in 2022) has been promoted as an upgrade, but its implementation introduces severe data protection concerns - so severe that it&rsquo;s fair to say it&rsquo;s a downgrade rather than an upgrade. Regardless, Microsoft increasingly pushes personal and business Outlook users to switch to the new Outlook. But IT admins should be warned: If employees press the toggle to switch to the new Outlook, they risk unintentional breaches of data protection laws, as all emails and login credentials are automatically stored on Microsoft’s cloud servers. This poses significant compliance issues, especially for businesses handling sensitive data.</p>

		<p>Microsoft’s AI Red Team just published “Lessons from<br>
Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products.” Their blog post lists “three takeaways,” but the eight lessons in the report itself are more useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Understand what the system can do and where it is applied.</li>
<li>You don’t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.</li>
<li>AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.</li>
<li>Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.</li>
<li>The human element of AI red teaming is crucial.</li>
<li>Responsible AI harms are pervasive but difficult to measure.</li>
<li>LLMs amplify existing security risks and introduce new ones&hellip;</li>

		<p>When Vasily Prokopov first came across DigitalOcean, one thing immediately stood out to him: <strong>DO Love</strong>. “How often do you find a company that lists love as one of its core values?” he thought. Fast forward to today, Vasily is thriving as a Staff Solutions Engineer in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where that same value shapes every aspect of his work. “The people here are genuinely supportive, always ready to lend a hand—whether you’re tackling a tricky task or eager to learn something new,” he says with a smile.</p>

		<p>Air-gapped environments are computer networks or systems that are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public internet or unsecured local area networks. This isolation is implemented as a security measure to protect sensitive data and critical systems from external cyber threats by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced security: By physically isolating systems from external networks, air-gapped environments help prevent remote attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized data access. This is crucial for highly sensitive data and critical systems.</li>
<li>Data protection: Air-gapping provides the strongest protection against data exfiltration since there&rsquo;s no direct connection that attackers could use to steal information.</li>
<li>Critical infrastructure protection: For systems that control vital infrastructure (like power plants, water treatment facilities, or military systems), air-gapping helps prevent potentially catastrophic cyber attacks.</li>
<li>Compliance requirements: Many regulatory frameworks require air-gapping for certain types of sensitive data or critical systems, particularly in government, healthcare, and financial sectors.</li>
<li>Malware protection: Without network connectivity, systems are protected from network-based malware infections and ransomware attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though air-gapped systems are isolated, they can still have vulnerabilities. Regular security scanning helps identify these weaknesses before they can be exploited. In this article, you will learn the different security scanners GitLab provides and how they can be added/updated in a limited-connectivity environment.</p>

</p>
<p>The recent UK Home Office proposal designed to hinder and disrupt ransomware operations through several proposed measures, including a targeted ban on ransomware payments, has again brought this question into the public square. The question of whether to pay a ransom demand is a decades-long argument with ardent opinions on both sides.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Having served our country in the cyberranks of the first Trump Administration, we know how important it is for the second Trump Administration to hit the ground running in its cyber defense mission. As recent events have reinforced, our cyber adversaries – China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and beyond – aren’t sitting on their hands.</p>
<p>We are confident that the incoming national security and cybersecurity team is ready to forcefully counter adversarial cyber activity from foreign nation-states; fight the proliferation of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and other U.S. businesses; protect American intellectual property; and embrace AI innovation as a critical enabler of cyber resilience. These are all goals the entire nation can rally around.</p>
