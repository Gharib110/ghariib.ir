<p>I&rsquo;m back in Oslo! Writing this the day after recording, it feels like I couldn&rsquo;t be further from Dubai; the temperature starts with a minus, it&rsquo;s snowing and there&rsquo;s not a supercar in sight.</p>
<p>Back on business, this week I&rsquo;m talking about the challenge of loading breaches and managing costs. A breach load immediately takes us from a very high percentage cache hit ratio on Cloudflare to zero. Consequently, our SQL costs skyrocket as the DB scales to support the load. Approximately 28 hours after loading the two breaches I mention in this week&rsquo;s update, we&rsquo;re still running a DB scale that&rsquo;s 350% larger than once we have a high cache hit ratio, and that <em>directly</em> hits my wallet. We need to work on this more because as I say in the video, I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t like financial incentives that influence how breaches are handled, such as delaying them and bulking them together to reduce the impact of cache flush events like this. We&rsquo;ll give that more thought, I think there are a few ways to tackle this. For now, here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s video and some of the challenges we&rsquo;re facing:</p>

<p>I fell waaay behind the normal video cadence this week, and I couldn&rsquo;t care less ðŸ˜Š I mean c&rsquo;mon, would you rather be working or sitting here looking at this view after snowboarding through Christmas?!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That said, Scott and I did carve out some time to chat about the, uh, &ldquo;colourful&rdquo; feedback he&rsquo;s had after finally putting a price on some Report URI features he&rsquo;d been giving away free for years. And there&rsquo;s more data breaches, of course, including a couple I loaded over the previous week that I think were particularly interesting. Enjoy this week&rsquo;s video, next week&rsquo;s will be a 2024 wrap-up from somewhere much, much sunnier ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a certain irony to the Bluesky situation where people are pushing back when I include links to X. Now, where have we seen this sort of behaviour before? ðŸ¤” When I&rsquo;m relying on content that only appears on that platform to add context to a data breach in HIBP <em>and</em> that content is freely accessible from within the native Bluesky app (without needing an X account), we&rsquo;re out of reasonable excuses for the negativity. And if &ldquo;because Elon&rdquo; is the sole reason and someone is firm enough in their convictions on that, there&rsquo;s a very easy solution ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Today, we&rsquo;re happy to welcome the 37th government to have full and free access to domain searches of their gov domains in Have I Been Pwned, Armenia. Armenia&rsquo;s National Computer Incident Response Team AM-CERT now joins three dozen other national counterparts in gaining visibility into how data breaches impact their national interests.</p>

<p>You know how banks really, really want to avoid their customers falling victim to phishing scams? And how they put a heap of effort into education to warn folks about the hallmarks of phishing scams? And how banks are the shining beacons of light when it comes to demonstrating security best practices? Ok, that final one might be a bit of a stretch, but the fact remains that people have high expectations of how banks should communicate to ensure that they themselves don&rsquo;t come across as phishers:</p>

		<p>Here at Bitdefender, we&rsquo;re constantly working on improving detection capabilities for our macOS cyber-security products; part of this effort involves revisiting old (or digging up new) samples from our malware zoo.

		<p>It was a cold and wet Thursday morning, sometime in early 2006. There I was sitting at the very top back row of an awe-inspiring lecture theatre inside Royal Holloway&rsquo;s Founderâ€™s Building inÂ Egham, Surrey (UK)Â while studying for my MSc in Information Security. Back then, the lecture in progress was from the software security module.</p>

</p>
<p>More than 3 years ago now, Scott Helme and I launched a little project called Why No HTTPS? It listed the world&rsquo;s largest websites that didn&rsquo;t properly redirect insecure requests to secure ones. We updated it December before last and pleasingly, noted that more websites than ever were doing the right thing and forcing browsers down the secure path. That&rsquo;s the good news, the bad news is that there are still some really wacky, unexplainable anti-HTTPS views out there, but those voices are increasingly less relevant as the browsers march forward:</p>

	<div>
		<p>For over 15 years, YARA has been growing and evolving until it became an indispensable tool in every malware researcher&rsquo;s toolbox. Throughout this time YARA has seen numerous updates, with new features added and countless bugs fixed. But today, I&rsquo;m excited to announce the biggest change yet: a full rewrite.</p>
<p>YARA-X is a completely new implementation of YARA in Rust, and it has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Better user experience</strong>: The new command-line interface is more modern and colorful, and error reports are now more explicative. More features aimed at improving the user&rsquo;s experience will be incorporated in the future.</p>
