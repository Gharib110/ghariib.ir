<p>As we prepare to say goodbye to 2024, the state of security operations continues to evolve and adapt as organizations face increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and early signs of cybercriminal adoption of AI. Current solutions often rely on siloed tools, and manual processes are proving inadequate in addressing the complexity and scale of modern threats. According to Unit 42, the time between initial compromise and data exfiltration is decreasing, and attackers are sometimes beginning to exfiltrate data in hours, not days. What does that mean for 2025?</p>

		<p>2024 has been a banner year for artificial intelligence (AI). As enterprises ramp up adoption, however, malicious actors have been exploring new ways to compromise systems with intelligent attacks.</p>
<p>With the AI landscape rapidly evolving, it’s worth looking back before moving forward. Here are our top five AI security stories for 2024.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-hear-me-now-hackers-hijack-audio-with-ai">Can you hear me now? Hackers hijack audio with AI</h2>
<p>Attackers can fake entire conversations using large language models (LLMs), voice cloning and speech-to-text software. This method is relatively easy to detect, however, so researchers at IBM X-Force carried out an experiment to determine if parts of a conversation can be captured and replaced in real-time.</p>

	<div>
		<p>When thinking about cybersecurity, we envision malicious actors working in dark basements, honing their tools to invent cunning new ways to breach our defenses. While this is a clear and present danger, it&rsquo;s also important to understand that another hazard is lurking much closer to home - the insider threat. These attacks have devastated entities in all sectors, with severe repercussions. These incidents can vary from straightforward acts of fraud or theft to more elaborate sabotage attempts. This is concerning because the recent IBM 2024 Cost of Data Breach survey found that the cost of a&hellip;</p>

		<p>Hello Devs,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Data is the new oil,” they say, but in healthcare and finance, it’s more like nitroglycerin—immensely valuable, yet dangerously explosive if mishandled.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I recently shared on social media that I&rsquo;ve joined the healthcare industry. This marks a shift from my background in both e-commerce and finance. During my time in finance, I dealt extensively with highly sensitive data like bank statements, KYC information, personal identification details, and other financial records. I vividly recall understanding that even a minor data handling error could have severe repercussions: breaches, fines, and, most importantly, a loss of public trust. This same level of data sensitivity exists in healthcare, where every piece of patient information is crucial and protected by regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. To comply with these regulations and similar ones worldwide, data masking has become essential. In this blog, I’ll break down what Powertools is, how it can be used for data masking in AWS Lambda, and why it’s critical for domains like finance and healthcare. While Powertools for AWS Lambda existed for .NET and TypeScript, the May 2024 release of Python support has been a major boost, making it accessible to a much wider audience. Let&rsquo;s dive into Powertools for AWS Lambda.</p>

		<p>We released a new open source byte-pair tokenizer that is faster and more flexible than popular alternatives.</p>
<p>The post So many tokens, so little time: Introducing a faster, more flexible byte-pair tokenizer appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs), such as those used by GitHub Copilot, do not operate directly on bytes but on <em>tokens</em>, which can complicate scaling. In this post, we explain how we solved that challenge at GitHub to support the growing number of Copilot users and features since the first launching Copilot two years ago.</p>

<p>The McAfee mobile research team recently identified a significant global increase of SpyLoan, also known as predatory loan apps, on Android. These PUP (potentially unwanted programs) applications use social engineering tactics to trick users into providing sensitive information and granting extra mobile app permissions,  which can lead to extortion, harassment, and financial loss. </p>
<p>During our investigation of this threat, we identified fifteen apps with a combined total of over eight million installations.  This group of loan apps share a common framework to encrypt and exfiltrate data from a victim’s device to a command and control (C2) server using a similar HTTP endpoint infrastructure. They operate localized in targeted territories, mainly in South America, Southern Asia, and Africa, with some of them being promoted through deceptive advertising on social media.  </p>

<p>As smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives, malicious apps have grown increasingly deceptive and sophisticated. Recently, we uncovered a seemingly harmless app called “BMI CalculationVsn” on the Amazon App Store, which is secretly stealing the package name of installed apps and incoming SMS messages under the guise of a simple health tool. McAfee reported the discovered app to Amazon, which took prompt action, and the app is no longer available on Amazon Appstore.</p>
