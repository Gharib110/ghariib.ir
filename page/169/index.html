		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Better Codes for the HQC Cryptosystem</strong><br>
<em>Cyrius Nugier, Jean-Christophe Deneuville</em></p>
<p>In the HQC cryptosystem, the length $n$ of the code determines several concrete parameters such as the bandwidth usage, the memory consumption, or the decoding efficiency. In this paper, we show that currently known methods to explicitly generate asymptotically good (especially with high relative distances), binary codes with efficient associated procedures cannot be used to improve $n$. We also show that concatenated codes are currently better suited, and by exhausting small codes, find a closer to optimal concatenated code for HQC, which improves upon currently used codes.</p>

<p>Vehicle alternators are interesting beasts. Produced on a massive scale, these electric machines are available for a minimum of cost and contain all kinds of great parts: some power electronics and a belt-driven generator are generally standard fare. This generator can also be used as a motor with only minor changes to the machine as a whole, so thanks to economies of scale itâ€™s possible to get readily-available, powerful, compact, and cheap motors for all kinds of projects using alternators as a starting point. [LeoDJ] noticed that this starter motor in a modern Mercedes had some interesting benefits beyond all of these perks, but it took a bit more work to get up and running than a typical alternator would have.</p>

<p>The moon is a popular target for ham radio operators to bounce signals since itâ€™s fairly large and follows a predictable path. There are some downsides, though; itâ€™s not always visible from the same point on Earth and is a relatively long way away. Thinking they could trade some distance for size, an amateur radio group from the Netherlands was recently able to use a radio telescope pointed at a geostationary satellite to reflect a signal back down to Earth, using this man-made satellite to complete the path instead of the more common natural one.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2019-15690<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 24, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 12Â hours, 2Â minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> LibVNCServer 0.9.12 release and earlier contains heap buffer overflow vulnerability within the HandleCursorShape() function in libvncclient/cursor.c. An attacker sends cursor shapes with specially crafted dimensions, which can result in remote code execution.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>
