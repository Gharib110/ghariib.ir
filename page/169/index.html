	<div>
		<p>In programming, it’s common to come across 0, null, and undefined. These three values might seem similar at first glance, but they serve different purposes and behave differently in code. Let’s explore what each means and how they work, with simple examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-zero-0">What is Zero (0)?</h2>
<p>The value 0 represents a number, specifically the smallest non-negative number. It is a defined value and is treated as a number in JavaScript.</p>

<p>By and large, our clothes don’t actively <em>move.</em> They’re simple pieces of fabric assembled to sit nicely on our bodies, and little more. [anoukwipprecht] created something a little more technological and confronting, though, with the Robotic Open-Source Scale Dress.

<p>Right from the drop, you can see what the dress is all about. It’s an open-shoulder design that has eight large moving scales mounted on the front. These scales are printed, and each features its own servo for independent movement. The scale baseplates are designed to hide the servos themselves, creating a sleeker look that hides the mechanism underneath. Each baseplate is also perforated with holes, allowing it to be sewn on to the base garment in a stout fashion. The dress itself is created with thick neoprene fabric, enabling it to take the weight of the scale assemblies without sagging or pulling away from the body. You can even customize the scales in various ways—such as adding feathers instead.</p>

		<p>You probably have a lot of games you love on the Game Boy, but have you tried these? Give them a shot.</p>
<p>Nintendo&rsquo;s Game Boy is an absolutely iconic handheld console that many of us look back on fondly (that&rsquo;s probably why Nintendo is making a Lego version of it). While I didn&rsquo;t grow up with a Game Boy myself, I have played a few games on the platform and I know there&rsquo;s quite a lot to love on it.</p>

		<p>In order to stay competitive, AMD needs to step it up with these things.</p>
<p>The last two weeks have been all about Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 50 series launch — the company&rsquo;s performance claims, the actual rasterized gen-on-gen gains, and the &ldquo;fake vs. real frames&rdquo; debate. It&rsquo;s also been about the notable absence of AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 4 graphics cards from its CES keynote. The company&rsquo;s RX 9000 GPUs were a no-show at CES, which AMD tried to justify. Many people believe the company might not be confident in its offerings.</p>
