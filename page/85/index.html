Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) user? If so, you will be pleased to hear that Ubuntu is now available in Microsoft’s new tar-based distro format — no need to use the sluggish Microsoft Store. Canonical announced the news today, noting that “the new tar-based WSL distro format allows developers and system administrators to distribute, install, and manage Ubuntu WSL instances from tar files without relying on the Microsoft Store.” In not relying on the Microsoft Store for distribution, it’s less hassle for enterprises to roll out (and customise) Ubuntu on WSL at scale as images packaged in using the new […]</p>

<p>Today we’re announcing ChatGPT Gov, a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed to provide U.S. government agencies with an additional way to access OpenAI’s frontier models.</p>
<p>Agencies can deploy ChatGPT Gov in their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud or Azure Government cloud on top of Microsoft’s Azure’s OpenAI ⁠ (opens in a new window) Service. Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Use of ChatGPT Gov is subject to our usage policies, like other OpenAI services.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>We are excited to introduce a new capability in Bitbucket Pipelines – Step Failure Strategies. This is the first of a set of new features allowing developers to implement more comprehensive logic and control-flow inside their CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>Failure Strategies are designed to give you explicit control over how your pipeline behaves in the event that an individual step within the pipeline fails. This initial release will include the <code>ignore</code> strategy, which is particularly useful for complex pipelines with steps like code styling suggestions or informational tests, where certain steps failing within the pipeline shouldn’t necessarily cause the entire build to fail.</p>

		<p>The last several days have been dubbed a “Sputnik moment” for Americans, who are discovering that foreign software engineers are much further ahead than previously thought. On January 20th, the Chinese company DeepSeek announced the release of their newest large language model (LLM) “DeepSeek R1.” Reportedly trained for just $6 million, DeepSeek R1 achieves capabilities that more than rival the output of American AI giants like Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Google, whose models have required billions in investment. </p>

	<div>
		<p><strong>1. Problema da forma serializada padrão</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A forma serializada padrão pode tornar impossível substituir uma implementação descartável.</li>
<li>Muitas classes da biblioteca Java, como BigInteger, sofreram com essa limitação.</li>
<li>Deve-se avaliar se a forma serializada padrão é apropriada em termos de flexibilidade, desempenho e correção.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Quando a forma serializada padrão é aceitável?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quando a representação física do objeto é idêntica ao seu conteúdo lógico.</li>
<li>Exemplo: uma classe Name com três String (sobrenome, primeiro nome e nome do meio).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Problemas ao usar a forma serializada padrão quando a representação física difere do conteúdo lógico</strong></p>
