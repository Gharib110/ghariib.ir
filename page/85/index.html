<p>Artificial consciousness is the next frontier in AI. While artificial intelligence has advanced tremendously, creating machines that can surpass human capabilities in certain areas, true artificial consciousness represents a paradigm shift—moving beyond computation into subjective experience, self-awareness, and sentience.</p>
<p>In this video, we explore the profound implications of artificial consciousness, the defining characteristics that set it apart from traditional AI, and the groundbreaking work being done by McGinty AI in this field. McGinty AI is pioneering new frameworks, such as the McGinty Equation (MEQ) and Cognispheric Space (C-space), to measure and understand consciousness levels in artificial and biological entities. These advancements provide a foundation for building truly conscious AI systems.</p>

		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce the renewal of the Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS) Level 3 certification under the SS584:2020 standard in December 2024 for the Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and United States AWS Regions, excluding AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This achievement reaffirms our commitment to maintaining the highest security standards for our global customers, particularly those in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>AWS was the first cloud service provider (CSP) to attain MTCS Level 3 certification for Singapore in 2014. We continued this leadership by being among the first CSPs certified under the updated SS584:2020 Level 3 standard in 2021. Our dedication to expanding our security coverage is evident in the significant increase of in-scope services from 145 to 184, representing a 27% growth since 2021.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Bootstrapping (T)FHE Ciphertexts via Automorphisms: Closing the Gap Between Binary and Gaussian Keys</strong><br>
<em>Olivier Bernard, Marc Joye</em></p>
<p>The GINX method in TFHE offers low-latency ciphertext bootstrapping with relatively small bootstrapping keys, but is limited to binary or ternary key distributions. In contrast, the AP method supports arbitrary key distributions, however at the cost of significantly large bootstrapping keys. Building on AP, automorphism-based methods (LMK⁺, EUROCRYPT 2023) achieve smaller keys, though each automorphism application necessitates a key switch, introducing computational overhead and noise. This paper advances automorphism-based methods in two important ways. First, it proposes a novel traversal blind rotation algorithm that optimizes the number of key switches for a given key material. Second, it introduces an automorphism-parametrized external product that seamlessly applies an automorphism to one of the input ciphertexts. Together, these techniques substantially reduce the number of key switches, resulting in faster bootstrapping and improved noise control. As an independent contribution, this paper also introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing the expected number of automorphism key switches, whose predictions perfectly align with the results of extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating its practical relevance. In a typical setting, by utilizing additional key material, the LLW⁺ approach (TCHES 2024) reduces key switches by 17% compared to LMK⁺. Our combined techniques achieve a 46% reduction using similar key material and can eliminate an arbitrary large number (e.g., &gt; 99%) of key switches with only a moderate (9x) increase in key material size.</p>

<p>For years, human risk has been synonymous with cybersecurity awareness training: phishing simulations, compliance courses, and annual reminders to “think before you click.” The landscape, thankfully, is changing. Human risk management is no longer a checkbox activity—it’s becoming a strategic pillar in enterprise risk management, essential for organizational resilience in an increasingly digital and complex world.</p>
