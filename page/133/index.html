		<p>Need a beginner-friendly GUI that&rsquo;s laden with all the essential features to manage your containers? Portainer has your back!</p>
<p>Containers are perfect when you want to isolate your self-hosted services without the extra overhead of virtual machines. While the Docker CLI is the ideal way to manage your containers, running commands for simple operations can get tiresome at times. Docker Desktop is a decent option, but it‚Äôs rather rudimentary in its functionality.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a different browser, see why I used Opera GX.</p>
<p>We all wish our browsers could do things better, but we generally stick to mainstream options like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge because we&rsquo;re stuck in their ecosystem and put faith in their abilities.

		<p>Ready to take your backups to the cloud? Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p>Storing data in the cloud using free or expensive subscriptions is one thing, but it&rsquo;s a whole different beast to store even more data in the long term. You could use Apple iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive for all your backups and data you don&rsquo;t need to frequently access, but when working with big data or cold storage, it&rsquo;s best to use a provider with the means to manage files for longer periods and provide the support and software to make your life easier. We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the best long-term cool and cold storage providers right here.</p>
