		<p>Before we ring in the New Year, SentinelOne reviews and reflects on some of the most formative cyber news stories that occurred in 2024.</p>
<p>It’s almost time to wave goodbye to the year that was 2024, and as we look ahead to 2025 and the challenges that might bring, now is a good time to reflect on the best, the worst and the ugliest cybersecurity news stories over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>We always enjoy videos from the [Mathologer], but we especially liked the recent video on the Helicone, a toy with a surprising connection to mathematics. The toy is cool all by itself, but the video shows how a sufficiently large heliocone models many “natural numbers” and acts, as [Mathologer] puts it, acts as “microscope to probe the nature of numbers.”</p>
<p>The chief number of interest is the so-called golden ratio. A virtual model of the toy allows easy experimentation and even some things that aren’t easily possible in the real world. The virtual helicone also allows you to make a crazy number of layers, which can show certain mathematical ideas that would be hard to do in a 3D print or a wooden toy.</p>

		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will reportedly arrive in April 2025, according to an accessory manufacturer.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is buzzing with the latest hardware from NVIDIA, AMD, Lenovo, and plenty of other tech giants — all of which were expected, but unexpectedly, it&rsquo;s also buzzing with news about the new Nintendo Switch that&rsquo;s slated to arrive this year. The latest being a report from Numerama (thanks, VGC) where accessory maker Genki has potentially spilled the beans that Nintendo&rsquo;s next generation of hardware will arrive sometime in April 2025.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In a compelling analysis of modern enterprise platforms, former Amazon platform architect and enterprise technology veteran Gregor Hohpe challenges conventional wisdom about how organizations can balance standardization with innovation. His insights arrive at a critical moment when enterprises are grappling with unprecedented technological complexity while seeking ways to accelerate development and ensure compliance.</p>
<p>This article reviews his recent talk at the 2024 Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit: Platforms: Perfectly Portable Productivity Propellants?</p>

<p>Face it, we’ve all been there, in a crowded workshop building something, and horror of horrors, things are going to get a little… <em>windy</em>. Do you try to drop it quietly and hope nobody says the rhyme, do you bolt for the door, or can you tough it out and hold it in? Never fear, because [Roman_2798881] has got your back, with the FartMaster 3000.</p>
<p>No doubt born of urgent necessity, it’s a discreet wall-mounted fixture for a shop vac line which allows a casual activation of the shopvac as if some sawdust needed removing, and backing up for a safe disposal of any noxious clouds under cover of the vacuum’s whirring.</p>
