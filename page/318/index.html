		<p>You’ve been there before: standing in front of your team, announcing a major technological transformation that you know is crucial for the company’s future. Despite your careful preparation, you can see it in their eyes—skepticism, confusion, or worse, quiet resignation. The change you’re proposing may be exactly what the organization needs, but your message isn’t quite landing the way you hoped.</p>
<p>This scenario plays out in enterprise technology organizations every day, and it’s exactly what Paul Gaffney, former technology executive at Home Depot and Dick’s Sporting Goods, addressed in his powerful talk at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit 2024. After decades of driving major technological transformations, Gaffney has discovered that the difference between a change initiative’s success and failure often comes down to one critical skill: the ability to communicate in a way that truly enlists people in your vision.</p>

		<p>Such a flaw stems from Nuclei&rsquo;s template signature verification process, with the simultaneous usage of regular expressions, or regex, and YAML parser potentially resulting in the introduction of a &ldquo;r&rdquo; character read as a line break and leading to the circumvention of regex-based signature verification.</p>

<p>DevOps, a fusion of “Development” and “Operations,” represents a cultural and professional movement that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration among all stakeholders involved in the development, operations, and delivery of software. By fostering a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, DevOps seeks to shorten the software development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software. This methodology is characterized by a continuous cycle of integration, delivery, and deployment, which helps organizations adapt quickly to changing market demands and improve overall efficiency.</p>

<p>DevOps and platform engineering are essential disciplines that provide immense value in the realm of cloud-native technology and software delivery. However, these practices cannot stand alone. Rather, they must be bolstered by additional technological investments to ensure reliability, security, and efficiency. One of these key investments includes observability.</p>
<p>Observability of applications and infrastructure serves as a critical foundation for DevOps and platform engineering, offering a comprehensive view into system performance and behavior. It goes beyond traditional monitoring—metrics, logs, and traces—to encompass topology mapping, code-level details, and user experience metrics that provide real-time insights. This real-time awareness enables teams to rapidly detect and resolve issues: both indispensable capabilities for maintaining the agility and reliability that are central to DevOps and platform engineering processes.</p>
