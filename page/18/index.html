		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Capitalized Bitcoin Fork for National Strategic Reserve</strong><br>
<em>Charanjit Singh Jutla, Arnab Roy</em></p>
<p>We describe a strategy for a nation to acquire majority stake in Bitcoin with zero cost to the taxpayers of the nation. We propose a bitcoin fork sponsored by the the government of the nation, and backed by the full faith of treasury of the nation, such that the genesis block of this fork attributes fixed large amount of new kinds of tokens called strategic-reserve-bitcoin tokens (SRBTC) to the nation&rsquo;s treasury, which is some multiple (greater than one) of the amount of all Bitcoin tokens (BTC) currently set in the Bitcoin protocol. The BTC tokens continue to be treated 1:1 as SRBTC tokens in the forked chain. The only capital that the nation puts up is its explicit guarantee that the SRBTC tokens of the fork will be accepted as legal tender, such as payment of tax to the treasury.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Mar. 11, 2025</p>
<p>Despite the increasing efforts to increase women’s representation in cybersecurity, the industry still has a long way to go. However, there is progress on the horizon. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that women will represent 30 percent of the global cybersecurity workforce by 2025.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity jobs are expected to grow by 32 percent between 2022 and 2032, making now the perfect time to transition into this high-demand field, according to a story in BBN Times that highlights the top 8 in-demand cybersecurity certifications that can unlock new opportunities.</p>

		<p>Over the years, Cloudflare has gained fame for many things, including our technical blog, but also as a tech company securing the Internet using <strong>lava lamps</strong>, a story that began as a research/science project almost 10 years ago. In March 2025, we added another layer to its legacy: a &ldquo;wall of entropy&rdquo; made of 50 <strong>wave machines</strong> in constant motion at our Lisbon office, the company&rsquo;s European HQ. </p>
<p>These wave machines are a new source of entropy, joining <strong>lava lamps</strong> in San Francisco, <strong>suspended rainbows</strong> in Austin, and <strong>double chaotic pendulums</strong> in London. The entropy they generate contributes to securing the Internet through LavaRand.</p>
