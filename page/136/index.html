	<div>
		<p>A financially motivated threat actor has been linked to a sophisticated cyber campaign that has been targeting users in Poland and Germany since July 2024. </p>
<p>The effort uses phishing emails to spread a range of malware payloads, including Agent Tesla, Snake Keylogger, and an undocumented backdoor called TorNet. </p>
<p>This backdoor leverages Windows Scheduled Tasks for persistence and employs advanced evasion techniques to bypass detection.</p>
<p>Cisco Talos researchers report that the attack begins with phishing emails masquerading as financial institutions or logistics companies. These emails, written predominantly in Polish and German, contain malicious attachments compressed in .tgz format. </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the Anonymity of Linkable Ring Signatures</strong><br>
<em>Xavier Bultel, Charles Olivier-Anclin</em></p>
<p>Security models provide a way of formalising security properties in a rigorous way, but it is sometimes difficult to ensure that the model really fits the concept that we are trying to formalise. In this paper, we illustrate this fact by showing the discrepancies between the security model of anonymity of linkable ring signatures and the security that is actually expected for this kind of signature. These signatures allow a user to sign anonymously within an ad hoc group generated from the public keys of the group members, but all their signatures can be linked together. Reading the related literature, it seems obvious that users&rsquo; identities must remain hidden even when their signatures are linked, but we show that, surprisingly, almost none have adopted a security model that guarantees it. We illustrate this by presenting two counter-examples which are secure in most anonymity model of linkable ring signatures, but which trivially leak a signer&rsquo;s identity after only two signatures.</p>

<p>The post Open source AI is already finding its way into production appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Open source has long driven innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, from web interfaces to cloud-native computing. The same is true in the burgeoning field of open source artificial intelligence (AI). Open source AI models, and the tooling to build and use them, are multiplying, enabling developers around the world to build custom AI solutions and host them where they choose.</p>
