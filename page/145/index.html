		<p>Let your old iPad live a vibrant life again</p>
<p>In a world where many of us buy new technology the moment updates are released, we have more electronic waste than ever before. Perhaps your old iPad is collecting dust somewhere right now, and needs a purpose. The good news is that there are plenty of unconventional ways to reuse an older iPad to prevent it from being thrown into the iPad graveyard. You can test out open-source illustration tools, or use your iPad in many productive ways to avoid waste.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the perfect capacitor to decouple the power rails around ICs is a 100 nF ceramic capacitor or equivalent, yet where does this ‘fact’ come from and is it even correct? These are the questions that [Graham] set out to answer once and for all. He starts with an in-depth exploration of the decoupling capacitor (and related) theory. [Graham] then dives into the way that power delivery is affected by the inherent resistance, capacitance, and inductance of traces. This is the problem that decoupling capacitors are supposed to solve.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 22 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.<br>
