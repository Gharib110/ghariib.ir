		<p>Making your own bad news is not what Valley News Live had in mind, but negligence comes at a price.</p>
<p>Cybernews researchers found an unprotected AWS S3 bucket that belongs to Take Valley News Live, a North Dakota-based television station. Gray Television, the owner of Valley News Live, makes for the third largest broadcasting company in the US.</p>
<p>An S3 bucket is like a virtual file folder in the cloud where you can store various types of data, such as text files, images, videos, and more. There is no limit to the amount of data you can store in an S3 bucket, and individual instances can be up to 5 TB in size.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a methodology that brings together development and operations to streamline and automate the software development lifecycle. It focuses on improving collaboration, enhancing efficiency, and delivering high-quality software at a faster pace. DevOps practices are applicable across a wide range of industries and business sectors, where they help organizations automate and optimize the processes of software development, deployment, and monitoring.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll explore <strong>where DevOps is used</strong>, its major applications in different industries, and how it’s transforming the way organizations deliver software and services.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) practices that aims to improve the efficiency, collaboration, and quality of software delivery. It is a cultural shift that focuses on breaking down silos between traditionally separate teams to improve the speed, reliability, and quality of software deployment. By integrating automation, monitoring, and collaboration, DevOps helps organizations deliver software faster, with fewer errors, and better alignment with customer needs.</p>

		<p>Data breaches continue to cost organizations millions of dollars each year, with costs rising steadily. According to IBM&rsquo;s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report, the average cost of a data breach has surged to $4.88 million globally, reflecting the increasing complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks. In the United States, this figure is even higher, averaging $9.8 million per breach, and the healthcare industry remains a prime target, with an average breach cost of $10 million—the highest of any sector. What Drives These Staggering Costs? Several factors contribute to these sky-high figures&hellip;</p>

<p>Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a security testing method designed to identify vulnerabilities in applications while running. Unlike static testing methods, which analyze code at rest, DAST interacts with live applications and mimics real-world attacks to uncover security flaws. This makes DAST particularly effective for detecting issues that only occur when an application is running.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to increase the collaboration between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. By unifying these traditionally separate groups, DevOps seeks to shorten the development lifecycle, enhance the quality of software, and ensure faster and more reliable releases. The core philosophy of DevOps revolves around automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and a culture of shared responsibility.</p>
<p>In this post, we will dive into <strong>what DevOps is</strong>, its essential features, and how its implementation leads to more efficient and collaborative software delivery processes.</p>
