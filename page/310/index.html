		<p>Sukanya Thapliyal Digital systems and Information Communication Technology (ICT) play an increasingly central role in our lives. Technological advancement has created new opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems and networks. The resulting cybercrimes can affect everyone, from government and multinational corporations to individuals. As technology continues to make deeper inroads into our lives, […]</p>

		<p>The need for secure and high quality software becomes more critical every day as the impact of vulnerabilities increases and related costs continue to rise. For example, flawed software cost the U.S. economy $2.08 trillion in 2020 alone, according to the Consortium for Information and Software Quality (CISQ). And, a software defect that might cost $100 to fix if found early in the development process can grow exponentially to $10,000 if discovered later in production. </p>

		<p>The White House announced the launch of the US Cyber Trust Mark which aims to help buyers make an informed choice about the purchase of wireless internet-connected devices, such as baby monitors, doorbells, thermostats, and more.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity labeling program for wireless consumer Internet of Things (IoT) products is voluntary but the participants include several major manufacturers, retailers, and trade associations for popular electronics, appliances, and consumer products. The companies and groups said they are committed to increase cybersecurity for the products they sell.</p>

		<p>Ventiva showed off the first laptop fully cooled by its ICE9 fanless tech at CES 2025.</p>
<p>Last year, we were excited to see the launch of Ventiva&rsquo;s wizard-like ICE9 fanless cooling technology and were wowed by their invention&rsquo;s ability to push massive amounts of air without making a sound. We&rsquo;ve been eagerly awaiting a real-world implementation of this product in a laptop, and thanks to the joint efforts of Ventiva, Dell, and Intel, the company debuted a laptop cooled entirely by their ICE technology at CES 2025.</p>

		<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Those who know me are aware of how much I love the Japanese language and how dedicated I am to self-studying it. They also know that I can never sit still. For this reason, I developed <strong>Wakaruyo</strong>, a browser extension that is currently in the experimental phase.</p>
<p>This extension allows you to translate selected text on a webpage from Japanese to the language set in your browser, which is automatically detected.</p>

		<p>At Canonical, the work of our teams is strongly embedded in the open source principles and philosophy. We believe open source software will become the most prevalent method of software development and delivery in the future. Being open source is more than making the source of your software available, it’s also about contributing to other open source projects and helping to build communities. With this in mind, the web engineering team recently had the privilege of dedicating a week solely to contribute to external open source projects. We do this every year. </p>

		<p>You might have seen Windows 11 labeling networks as public or private, but what do these options mean? It&rsquo;s all about security.</p>
<p>At one point or another, you may have noticed that Windows labels your Wi-Fi networks as either private or public networks in the Wi-Fi settings. In fact, by default, they&rsquo;re all public networks, even if you&rsquo;re using it at home.</p>
