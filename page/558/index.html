<p>I’m not sure those attending their first break of code know what they are getting into. When I said <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/">“sure” to Moxie my first break, I sure didn’t</a>. During that week I had already come to the conclusion “I have to see this (TextSecure iOS) through”. In the intervening time, I’ve become an expert on the <a href="http://codexgalactic.com/2014/01/27/axolotl-protocol-for-cryptographically-secure-messaging/">Axolotl protocol</a>, <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/">come to understand ZRTP</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs">picked up the world’s best collaborator</a>, helped with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8">the final polish of Signal with RedPhone support</a> and contributed <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS/graphs/contributors">a lot of code to the TextSecure prototype</a>.</p>

<p>As it does every morning, the day started with Moxie singing the stand-up song, reminding us all (and waking up the slackers) that at 9am sharp we all get in a circle to discuss what we accomplished the day before and what our priorities are for the coming day.</p>

<p>After being promptly woken up by numerous roosters at 7:30 AM, I still can’t believe I’m here. My application was pretty last-minute, completed when I was in a state of droopiness and scholarship-application-hyperdrive. But I got on a plane from the Midwest, went from cloudy, 20 degrees with windchill making it feel like 0 to sunny, 77 degrees with mild winds making it feel still 77 degrees.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day 1</em></p>
<p>I woke up this morning feeling like this routine was normal, instead of implausible. Two days ago, I was in New York City, riding the train with millions of other commuters in the freezing snow. Today, I went surfing on a beach in beautiful Kauai. In the same absurd fashion, I shared meals, stories, and workspaces with people, who days earlier, I had only read about and admired from afar. The promises of the Winter Break of Code seem impossible: a vacation in paradise, large milestones of work to be met, a welcoming space with talented companions. But when Moxie came into the bedroom this morning strumming his ukulele to wake us for the daily morning stand-up, up we were, ready to claim the small victories in the browser extension project, the Signal iOS client, and the Android applications from the day prior and to lay out plans to further the state of user-friendly secure communication tools.</p>

<p>Privacy is a hot topic at the moment - it continues to dominate the headlines as news of new NSA incursions, celebrity phone hacks, and corporate breaches are being reported on an increasingly regular basis. In response to this, a number of products have been brought to market that attempt to provide consumers with a greater level of privacy than typical devices allow for. In the phone market, one of the premier products to be released in recent years is undoubtedly the BlackPhone (<a href="http://www.blackphone.ch/">http://www.blackphone.ch</a>), which has been cited numerous times in tech publications as being one of the best available defenses against mass surveillance, as it provides full end-to-end encryption facilities for voice calls and text/MMS messaging.</p>

<p>Every year when we do this kind of <a href="/blog/winter-of-code">call for proposals</a>, our experience from past events sets our expectations higher. Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high-quality proposals we received for this winter. It’s inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development of privacy-enhancing technology, and we hope that one day we’ll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals that we wish we could.</p>

<p>This January, Open Whisper Systems will be hosting a <em>Winter Break Of Code</em>. We’ve managed to get access to a large beachfront house in Kauai for three weeks, and we’re inviting people to join us. If you’re interested in spending one to three weeks in Hawaii working collaboratively on an Open Source project to make private communication simple, we’ll take care of your airfare and housing so that you can be there.</p>

As we prefer not to ship vulnerable ISOs, we’ve rolled up new images for our Kali Linux and NetHunter releases as well our Amazon AWS images with the relevant security fixes in place. These images correspond to Kali 1.0.9a and <a href="https://www.offsec.com/offsec/kali-nexus-nethunter-1-0-2/">NetHunter 1.0.2</a> versions, now available for <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download</a> through our mirrors. We expect the Amazon images to be updated in the AWS backend by the end of the week. If you’re already running Kali Linux, all you need to do is run an update and dist-upgrade to get the latest and greatest:</p>
