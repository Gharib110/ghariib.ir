		<p>2FA over SMS isn&rsquo;t just unreliable, it&rsquo;s also a security risk.</p>
<p>MFA, or Multi-Factor Authentication, has proliferated throughout our computing lives over the last decade. It largely began with SMS-based authentication in addition to a password, allowing users to add an extra layer of authentication by forcing users to enter a code sent to their phone upon an attempted login. The truth is, SMS-based authentication was never secure. Due to the inherent technology and the infrastructure around SIM cards, 2FA with SMS is not only inadequate; it also actively compromises your security, and here are 4 reasons why you should use a dedicated 2FA app instead.</p>

	<b><time>08.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>It might not have all of the features, but it&rsquo;s easy to use and looks good.</p>
<p>When it comes to tools you should use on your PC, Task Manager is one of the more useful tools for power users on Windows 11. It&rsquo;s quite common to use it for basic functionality like ending processes that refuse to close, but aside from that, there is a lot more it can do, too. If you want even more functionality, though, then you should try out an alternative like Task Manager DeLuxe.</p>

		<p>Buying a new mouse? Here are a few things you should be on the lookout for to make sure you get the right one</p>
<p>Upgrading any part of your computer setup is always a fun time. Even if you&rsquo;re not a gamer, getting that little bit of extra comfort or quality can go a long way toward making your experience better. It could make it easier to win games, but it could also help you get work done faster, and that&rsquo;s no different with computer mice.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Will these add-ons make you switch to Sheets from Excel?</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel is undoubtedly one of the most powerful apps out there to work with numbers. However, it requires an Office 365 subscription or an Office 2024 purchase, which isn&rsquo;t feasible for a lot of users. If you don&rsquo;t want to shell out money, a good alternative to Excel is Google Sheets. Not only is it free to use, but it is also a simpler version for students with less intimidating features and options. Moreover, you also get a plethora of templates and features like extensions for added functionality.</p>

<p>This is the third article on Building a SaaS with Ruby on Rails. This article continues where the previous one, adding sign up to Rails 8&rsquo; authentication, stops.</p>
<p>Most SaaS products are used by multiple people from the same team or company. Although I would, when you start building your SaaS, urge you to keep it simple and just support one user on launch. I would álso urge you to build the blocks needed for teams in your app from the get-go. Having to deal with workspaces, teams and roles when you already have users is a bigger pain than you can imagine.</p>

	<div>
		<p>One of the first things everyone predicted when artificial intelligence (AI) became more commonplace was that it would assist cybercriminals in making their phishing campaigns more effective.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have conducted a scientific study into the effectiveness of AI supported spear phishing, and the results line up with everyone’s expectations: AI is making it easier to do crimes.</p>
<p>The study, titled Evaluating Large Language Models’ Capability to Launch Fully Automated Spear Phishing Campaigns: Validated on Human Subjects, evaluates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to conduct personalized phishing attacks and compares their performance with human experts and AI models from last year.</p>
