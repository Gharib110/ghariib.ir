		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Founding Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Training on Optimum Vicinity</strong><br>
<em>Gefei Tan, Adrià Gascón, Sarah Meiklejohn, Mariana Raykova, Xiao Wang, Ning Luo</em></p>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs of training (zkPoT) allow a party to prove that a model is trained correctly on a committed dataset without revealing any additional information about the model or the dataset. Existing zkPoT protocols prove the entire training process in zero knowledge; i.e., they prove that the final model was obtained in an iterative fashion starting from the training data and a random seed (and potentially other parameters) and applying the correct algorithm at each iteration. This approach inherently requires the prover to perform work linear to the number of iterations.</p>

		<p>A new set of Git releases were published to address a variety of security vulnerabilities. All users are encouraged to upgrade. Take a look at GitHub’s view of the latest round of releases.</p>
<p>The post Git security vulnerabilities announced appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Today, the Git project released new versions to address a pair of security vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-50349 and CVE-2024-52006, that affect all prior versions of Git.</p>
<h2 id="cve-2024-50349">CVE-2024-50349</h2>
<p>When Git needs to fill in credentials interactively without the use of a credential helper, it prints out the hostname and asks the user to fill in the appropriate username/password pair for that host. However, Git prints out the hostname after URL-decoding it. This allows an attacker to craft URLs containing ANSI escape sequences that may be used to construct an intentionally misleading prompt. The attacker may then tweak the prompt to trick a user into providing credentials for a different Git host back to the attacker.</p>

When GNOME 48 is released in March it will debut with a brand-new audio player. Per a recent merge request, Decibels graduates from GNOME Incubator to GNOME Core Apps as part of GNOME 48, making the software something GNOME recommends downstream Linux distributions include to give users a fully-featured GNOME experience. You may be familiar with or even using Decibels already. I wrote about the app in late 2023, and it’s been available to install from Flathub for almost as long. For anyone not familiar with it, Decibels is a no-frills audio player designed for the GNOME desktop (but can […]</p>

		<p>When choosing a secure Google Calendar alternative you’re spoilt for choice – and most are free! However, many opt for Google or Apple Calendar as these are the default free calendar apps on Android or iPhones. While these apps are great for organization by offering useful features and an easy-to-use design, they track your every event. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s time for a replacement! If you’re looking for a calendar best for privacy, these popular calendars don’t make the cut. In this in-depth guide, we explore some of the best privacy-focused free calendar apps to choose from.</p>

<p>We’re opening up shop for Hackaday Europe, so get your tickets now! We’ve managed to get the ticket price down a bit this year, so you can join in all the fun for $145. And if you’re reading this right now, snap up one of the $75 early bird tickets as fast as you can.</p>
<p>Hackaday Europe is going down again in Berlin this year, on March 15th and 16th at MotionLab. It’s going to be a day and a half of presentations, lightning talks, badge hacking, workshops, and more. This is where Hackaday hangs out in person, and it’s honestly just a great time – if your idea of a great time is trading favorite PCB design tricks, crafting crufty code, and generally trading tales of hardware derring-do.</p>

<p>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical yet time-consuming process in the realm of software quality assurance (QA). It requires meticulous investigation to pinpoint the underlying cause of defects, often involving sifting through logs, analysing code, and correlating various system behaviours.</p>
<p>QA teams spend significant effort identifying the root cause, which can delay resolutions and increase downtime. As systems grow more complex, traditional RCA methods become less efficient, demanding advanced tools to assist in automating and streamlining the process.</p>

		<p>A common question during a forensic investigation of a digital device is: &ldquo;<strong>Has the user ever used the XYZ application?</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As always when answering this question, it is important to create and follow a solid process.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to share a possible process that everyone should customize based on their needs and roles.</p>
<p>The ability to answer the question depends on the acquisition that was obtained from the device. In this blog post, I will address the scenario where you have a full file system acquisition (or physical, for older devices).</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Hash-Based Multi-Signatures for Post-Quantum Ethereum</strong><br>
<em>Justin Drake, Dmitry Khovratovich, Mikhail Kudinov, Benedikt Wagner</em></p>
<p>With the threat posed by quantum computers on the horizon, systems like Ethereum must transition to cryptographic primitives resistant to quantum attacks. One of the most critical of these primitives is the non-interactive multi-signature scheme used in Ethereum&rsquo;s proof-of-stake consensus, currently implemented with BLS signatures. This primitive enables validators to independently sign blocks, with their signatures then publicly aggregated into a compact aggregate signature.</p>

<p>You have a project that needs something to move. Should you use a stepper motor or a servo motor? [Matthias] has an opinion, and you can hear his thoughts in the video below. One tip we’ll take away from the video: when working with motors, shoot some high-frame-rate video and slow it down to see what’s really happening.</p>
<p>The initial tests looked fine at normal speed. But increasing the frame rate and decreasing the playback speed showed some very interesting things like how much each motor was overshooting. The ability to control this sort of thing is a key differentiator for these kinds of motors.</p>
