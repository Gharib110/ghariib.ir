	<div>
		<p>TL;DR - Red Hat views the minimum criteria for open source AI as open source-licensed model weights combined with open source software components.More than three decades ago, Red Hat saw the potential of how open source development and licenses can create better software to fuel IT innovation. Thirty-million lines of code later, Linux not only developed to become the most successful open source software but the most successful software to date. Our commitment to open source principles continues today, not only in our business model, but in our corporate culture as well. We believe that these c</p>

	<div>
		<p>In our daily lives, we interact with many applications like Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook etc. If we observe carefully, the content loads continuously as we scroll. This seamless experience is achieved using infinite scrolling, a technique that keeps users engaged without interruptions.</p>
<h2 id="why-infinite-scrolling">Why Infinite Scrolling?</h2>
<p>Loading or processing a huge amount of data all at once during page load is not a good idea. It can negatively impact:</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong> – Fetching large amounts of data at once can slow down the application.<br>
<strong>User Experience</strong> – Users might face delays or lag while interacting with the application.</p>

		<h2 id="what-are-passkeys">What are passkeys?</h2>
<p>You may have seen the term “passkeys” appearing more frequently in tech news, app updates, and security discussions. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are rolling out passkeys as a replacement for passwords, promising both enhanced security and a smoother user experience. But what exactly are passkeys, and why are they considered the future of authentication?</p>
<p>With Password Day coming up this Saturday, it’s the perfect time to discuss the future of authentication. Passwords have long been the foundation of online security, but they come with significant downsides: they can be stolen, guessed, or reused across multiple sites. Enter passkeys, a next-generation authentication technology designed to replace passwords entirely with a more secure and user-friendly alternative.</p>
