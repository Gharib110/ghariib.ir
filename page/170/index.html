		<p>Why pay out big bucks for UI design when you can use this instead.</p>
<p>Sketch and Figma are two of the popular UI/UX design tools out there. While Figma’s free plan feels restrictive, Sketch is an outright paid app. Being a freelancer or a newcomer in the field, the monthly subscription fees for design tools can really put a dent in your budget. That’s where Penpot comes in, which offers a powerful yet affordable solution to anyone who doesn’t compromise on quality.</p>

		<p>As our Microsoft AI Tour reached Brussels, Paris, and Berlin toward the end of last year, we met with European organizations that were energized by the possibilities of our latest AI technologies and engaged in deployment projects. They were also alert to the fact that 2025 is the year that key obligations under the European Union’s AI Act come into effect, opening a new chapter in digital regulation as the world’s first, comprehensive AI law becomes a reality.  </p>

	<div>
		<p>Most container-based development starts with a base image on top of which developers can layer any additional libraries, binaries, and files needed to run an application. The Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) is a collection of OCI-compliant, freely redistributable, container-based images. These images are designed to be a foundation for cloud-native and web application use cases, maintained and updated regularly by Red Hat. While most Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) packages (RPMs) are available as a freely redistributable part of UBI images, there are use cases where developers need to install RPMs that require an active RHEL subscription (entitlement) for building images (i.e., via Dockerfile).</p>

		<p>Supply-chain attacks use trojanized legitimate Google Chrome extensions for data theft.</p>
<p>Right after Christmas, news broke of a multi-stage attack targeting developers of popular Chrome extensions. Ironically, the biggest-name target was a cybersecurity extension created by Cyberhaven — compromised just before the holidays (we’d previously warned about such risks). As the incident investigation unfolded, the list grew to include no fewer than 35 popular extensions, with a combined total of 2.5 million installations. The attackers’ goal was to steal data from the browsers of users who installed trojanized updates of these extensions. The focus of the campaign was on stealing credentials for Meta services to compromise business accounts and display ads at victims’ expense. However, that’s not the only data that malicious extensions can steal from browsers. We explain how the attack works, and what measures you can take to protect yourself against it at different stages.</p>

		<p>Recently, I came across a fantastic new paper by a group of NYU and Cornell researchers entitled “How to think about end-to-end encryption and AI.” I’m extremely grateful to see this paper, because while I don’t agree with <em>every single one</em> of it’s conclusions, it’s a good first stab at an incredibly important set of questions.</p>
<p>I was particularly glad to see this paper, but this exact topic has been very much on my mind this past few months. On the one hand, my interest stems from the rapid deployment of new AI assistant systems like Google’s scam call protection and Apple Intelligence, both of which aim to put AI basically everywhere on your phone — even, potentially, right in the middle of your encrypted messages. On the other hand, it comes from a recent European debate over “mandatory content scanning” laws that would require AI to scan virtually every private message you send.</p>

A major new release of Linux Mint is now available to download. Linux Mint 22.1 is the first update in the Linux Mint 22.x series and, like that version, is built on top of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and uses Linux Kernel 6.8 (though the distro plans to release newer kernel updates more often by opting-in to the Ubuntu HWE). Being based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS means Linux Mint 22.1 receives on-going updates until July 2029. Though it features few foundational changes, Linux Mint 22.1 brings improvements to what sits on top – a new version of the Cinnamon desktop, Wayland-friendly features, new […]</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t like AI tools? Well, now you&rsquo;re paying for them anyway.</p>
<p>How much do you use the Copilot features on Microsoft 365? If your answer to that is &ldquo;not a lot,&rdquo; then there&rsquo;s some bad news on the horizon. Your monthly bill for using the service is about to go up, and it&rsquo;s likely due to the addition of AI services across the platform. Worst of all, you can&rsquo;t opt out of this price rise, either; everyone is getting hit by it regardless of how much they use (or want) Copilot.</p>
