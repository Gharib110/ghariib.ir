		<p>A new cyberattack campaign, dubbed the “Fake DeepSeek Campaign,” has been discovered targeting macOS users. DeepSeek, a Chinese-developed AI chatbot, has rapidly gained popularity globally.</p>
<p>Threat Actors started exploiting its popularity to deliver malware &amp; infect users’ computers.</p>
<p>This campaign is designed to distribute the Poseidon Stealer, a sophisticated piece of malware to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised systems. </p>
<p>Security researchers with X handle @g0njxa have identified the campaign leveraging fake applications and malicious payloads to infiltrate macOS environments.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>FINAL bootstrap acceleration on FPGA using DSP-free constant-multiplier NTTs</strong><br>
<em>Jonas Bertels, Hilder V. L. Pereira, Ingrid Verbauwhede</em></p>
<p>This work showcases Quatorze-bis, a state-of-the-art Number Theoretic Transform circuit for TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs. It contains a novel modular multiplication design for modular multiplication with a constant for a constant modulus. This modular multiplication design does not require any DSP units or any dedicated multiplier unit, nor does it require extra logic whencompared to the state-of-the-art modular multipliers. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a constant multiplier Number Theoretic Transform design for TFHE-like schemes. Lastly, we use this Number Theoretic Transform design to implement a FINAL hardware accelerator for the AMD Alveo U55c which improves the Throughput metric of TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs by a factor 9.28x over Li et al.&rsquo;s NFP CHES 2024 accelerator and by 10-25% over the absolute state-of-the-art design FPT while using one third of FPTs DSPs.</p>

		<p>A charging station that can do it all</p>
<p>There are a lot of great chargers on the market, but if you&rsquo;re looking for something versatile, then we think this Baseus Charging Station is going to be just the thing. Not only does it provide plenty of USB ports, but it also has AC outlets as well. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s also quite portable, making it easy to carry with you wherever you need to go.</p>

		<p>Phemex, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, suffered a significant cyberattack that resulted in the theft of $85 million worth of digital assets. </p>
<p>The platform’s hot wallets, which are linked to the internet for real-time transactions, were the primary target of the hack. These wallets are more susceptible to intrusions than cold wallets, which stay offline.</p>
<p>Phemex has since implemented emergency measures to safeguard user funds and initiated a comprehensive investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>A DevOps dashboard is a visual representation of key metrics, data, and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that allow teams to track the performance of their applications, infrastructure, and DevOps processes. These dashboards provide insights into the health of the system, streamline communication between development, operations, and business teams, and help organizations make data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>Building a DevOps dashboard involves selecting the right metrics to track, integrating various data sources, and ensuring that the dashboard is user-friendly and actionable. In this post, we will walk through the process of building a DevOps dashboard, focusing on its major features and how it can drive improvements in efficiency, monitoring, and decision-making.</p>

<p>DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations, aiming to shorten the development lifecycle, enhance collaboration, and deliver high-quality software. One of the emerging tools that can significantly aid in implementing DevOps practices is ChatGPT. As an AI-driven language model, ChatGPT can assist teams in various ways, including automation, documentation, communication, and problem-solving within DevOps pipelines. By integrating ChatGPT into your DevOps workflows, teams can enhance productivity, reduce errors, and streamline processes.</p>

<p>Data Privacy Week is here, and there’s no better time to shine a spotlight on one of the biggest players in the personal information economy: data brokers. These entities collect, buy, and sell hundreds—sometimes thousands—of data points on individuals like you. But how do they manage to gather so much information, and for what purpose? From your browsing habits and purchase history to your location data and even more intimate details, these digital middlemen piece together surprisingly comprehensive profiles. The real question is: where are they getting it all, and why is your personal data so valuable to them? Let’s unravel the mystery behind the data broker industry.</p>
