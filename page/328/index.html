<p>There’s plenty of surprises to be had when you become a parent, and one of the first is that it’s suddenly your job to record  the frequency of your infant’s various bodily functions in exacting detail. How many times did the little tyke eat, how long did they sleep, and perhaps most critically, how many times did they poop. The pediatrician will expect you to know these things, so you better start keeping notes.</p>

Sad news from Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth today: longtime Ubuntu and Debian contributor Steve Langasek has passed away. In a touching post on the Ubuntu Discourse, Mark Shuttleworth shares: “Steve passed away at the dawn of 2025. His time was short but remarkable. He will forever remain an inspiration.” “Judging by the outpouring of feelings this week, he is equally missed and mourned by colleagues and friends across the open source landscape, in particular in Ubuntu and Debian where he was a great mind, mentor and conscience.” As a former Debian and Ubuntu release manager, and a long-term Canonical employee, […]</p>

		<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, efficient operations are the backbone of any successful cloud strategy. Whether you&rsquo;re managing a small-scale application or a complex enterprise environment, ensuring observability, maintaining configurations, and streamlining operations are essential. AWS offers a robust suite of tools to help organizations achieve operational excellence, including CloudWatch, Systems Manager, Config, and Service Catalog.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloud-operations-matter">Why Cloud Operations Matter</h2>
<p>Cloud operations involve the processes and tools used to manage, monitor, and optimize cloud-based infrastructure. These operations ensure your systems remain reliable, secure, and cost-effective. Observability, configuration management, and automation play a pivotal role in achieving these goals:</p>

<p>As CES kicks off in Las Vegas, we’re taking our place amongst the companies and thinkers who’re leading breakthroughs in tech. Some of the topics we’ll touch on in Las Vegas this year — the new breed of AI PCs, using AI in the fight against text and email scams, and AI-generated disinformation, and the state of the Scamiverse online today.</p>
<p>First up on Tuesday, Dan Huynh, our VP of Business Development, joins a panel of business leaders for a look at the new experiences that AI PCs can power. From video and photo editing to far-faster computing to increased security, Dan and the panel will share stories about how AI PCs can transform the way we work, play, and create.</p>

<p>In the world of data processing and messaging systems, terms like “queue” and “streaming” often come up. While they may sound similar, they serve distinct purposes and can significantly impact how systems handle data. Let’s break down their differences in a straightforward way.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h2>
<p>Imagine a coffee shop where customers place orders online or in person. Once an order is processed, the customer is notified to pick it up. In this analogy, orders function like messages in a queue, and the barista processes them one at a time, removing each order from the queue once completed. This is essentially how a message queue operates.</p>

		<p>The Microsoft DevLabs publisher was created as a hub for internal teams at Microsoft to channel their passion for Azure DevOps into experimental extensions. These extensions helped address product gaps and fostered innovation, ultimately benefiting Azure DevOps customers via the public marketplace.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Over time, as the original creators of these extensions moved on to other things, many extensions became outdated. This led to several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unresolved Issues and Questions</strong>: Customer feedback and bug reports were left unaddressed.</li>
<li><strong>Outdated Dependencies</strong>: Security and dependency updates were not maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Frustration</strong>: The resulting decline in extension quality negatively impacted the Azure DevOps experience as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>To restore the value of the Microsoft DevLabs publisher, we conducted a review to identify which extensions should be actively maintained and which needed to be deprecated.</p>

While we’re about to share the risk that was most frequently mentioned by the interviewees we spoke to, along with the primary tools and concepts for how to mitigate that risk, it may be a bit tough for you to fully understand the details of how the various details work together without having first read the book.
