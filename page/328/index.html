		<p>One of the best things about working in quantum computing is being exposed to a whole new set of skills and tools. For those of us coming from the software engineering side, discovering the things our academic peers are using is an interesting experience. One of the best for me personally was coming across the Julia programming language, and learning why it has become the go-to language for serious scientific programming in some circles.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 23, 2024</p>
<p>Cyberattacks are as old as the internet, but over the past several years they have become more insidious and destructive, in part by harnessing social engineering at scale and deploying increasingly sophisticated technology like generative AI. This year, cybercrime is projected to cost an estimated $9.5 trillion across the globe, according to Cybersecurity Ventures — approximately 9 percent of the world’s GDP.</p>

		<p>One of the best ways to make sure your web apps work well in different environments is to containerize them. Containers let you work in a more controlled way, which makes development and deployment easier. This guide will show you how to containerize a Django web app with Docker and explain why it’s a good idea.</p>
<p>We will walk through creating a Docker container for your Django application. Docker gives you a standardized environment, which makes it easier to get up and running and more productive. This tutorial is aimed at those new to Docker who already have some experience with Django. Let’s get started!</p>

		<p>Encrypting your emails is just a smart practice. See how to encrypt emails in Outlook.</p>
<p>When sending important information over email, such as financial statements, health records, or legal documents, it’s critical to keep them safe from prying eyes. If you’re a user of Microsoft Outlook, then you’re in luck! The popular email client has several ways of beefing up the security of your messages, one of them being encryption.</p>

		<p>If you made a mistake in an email and need to recall it, see how to unsend an email in Outlook.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why someone may want to recall an email, whether it&rsquo;s a simple mistake, the wrong recipient, or something more serious, like leaking confidential data. Fortunately, Microsoft Outlook users need not fret on such an occasion as Outlook has a built-in and easy-to-use recall feature to help unsend emails. However, there are caveats to the process, so it is important to consider a few factors before taking advantage of this feature.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>How to use your brain for cryptography without trustworthy machines</strong><br>
<em>Wakaha Ogata, Toi Tomita, Kenta Takahashi, Masakatsu Nishigaki</em></p>
<p>In this work, we study cryptosystems that can be executed securely without fully trusting all machines, but only trusting the user&rsquo;s brain. This paper focuses on signature scheme. We first introduce a new concept called ``server-aided in-brain signature,&rsquo;&rsquo; which is a cryptographic protocol between a human brain and multiple servers to sign a message securely even if the user&rsquo;s device and servers are not completely trusted. Second, we propose a concrete scheme that is secure against mobile hackers in servers and malware infecting user&rsquo;s devices.</p>
