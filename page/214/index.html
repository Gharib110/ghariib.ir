<p>Buried in a talk on AI from an artist who is doing cutting-edge video work was the following nugget that entirely sums up the zeitgeist: “The tools are changing so fast that artists can’t keep up with them, let alone master them, before everyone is on to the next.” And while you might think that this concern is only relevant to those who have to stay on the crest of the hype wave, the deeper question resounds with every hacker.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many industries, and software development is no exception. By automating repetitive tasks, optimizing processes, and providing data-driven insights, AI tools have significantly enhanced productivity and efficiency. However, despite its many benefits, AI-driven workflows come with certain limitations that developers and organizations must understand to make the most of these technologies. In this article, we will explore some of the most significant challenges that AI workflows face in the realm of software development.</p>

<p>Executive Summary: The FunkSec ransomware group emerged in late 2024 and published over 85 victims in December, surpassing every other ransomware group that month FunkSec operators appear to use AI-assisted malware development, which can enable even inexperienced actors to quickly produce and refine advanced tools The group’s activities straddle the line between hacktivism and cybercrime, complicating efforts to understand their true motivations Many of the group’s leaked datasets are recycled from previous hacktivism campaigns, raising doubts about the authenticity of their disclosures and the actual success of their operations Current methods of assessing ransomware group threats often rely on the […]</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On Multi-Key FuncCPA Secure Encryption Schemes</strong><br>
<em>Eri Nakajima, Keisuke Hara, Kyosuke Yamashita</em></p>
<p>The notion of funcCPA security for homomorphic encryption schemes was introduced by Akavia textit{et<del>al.} (TCC 2022). Whereas it aims to capture the bootstrapping technique in homomorphic encryption schemes, Dodis textit{et</del>al.} (TCC 2023) pointed out that funcCPA security can also be applied to non-homomorphic public-key encryption schemes (PKE). As an example, they presented a use case for privacy-preserving outsourced computation without homomorphic computation. It should be noted that prior work on funcCPA security, including the use case presented by Dodis textit{et~al.}, considered only the single-key setting. However, in recent years, multi-party collaboration in outsourced computation has garnered significant attention, making it desirable for funcCPA security to support the multi-key setting. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a new notion of security called Multi-Key funcCPA (MKfunc) to address this need, and show that if a PKE scheme is KDM-secure, then it is also MKfuncCPA secure. Furthermore, we show that similar discussions can be applied to symmetric-key encryption.</p>
