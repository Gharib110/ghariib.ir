<p>When the Game Boy Printer was released back in 1998, being able to produce a hard-copy of your <em>Pokémon</em> diploma or your latest Game Boy Camera snapshot at the touch of a button was was pretty slick indeed. But in our modern paperless society, the GB Printer somehow sticks out as even more archaic than the other add-on’s for Nintendo’s iconic handheld. Even among the folks who are still proudly playing the games that support the Printer, nobody actually wants to print anything out — although that doesn’t mean they don’t want to see the images.</p>

<p>Open source is one of the most exciting, but often misunderstood, innovations of our modern world. I still remember the first time I installed linux on my laptop, saw the vast array of packages I could install on it, all the utilities and libraries that make it work, all the forum threads filled with advice and debugging and troubleshooting, and I thought:</p>
<p><em>“Wait, all of this is</em> <strong><em>free</em></strong><em>???”</em></p>
<p>It’s free, you can use it, and it’s awesome. But you can go a surprisingly long time and still feel like you only have a vague idea of what “open source” actually means. It can take a while to get used to the jargon, the controversies, and the technical details.</p>

</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of Bambu Lab’s announcement that it would be locking down all network access to its X1-series 3D printers with new firmware, the X.509 certificate and private key from the Bambu Connect application have now been extracted by [hWuxH]. This application was intended to be the sole way for third-party software to send print jobs to Bambu Lab hardware as we previously reported.</p>
<p>The Bambu Connect app is a fairly low-effort Electron-based affair, with some attempt at obfuscation and encryption, but not enough to keep prying eyes out. The de-obfuscated <code>main.js</code> file can be found here (archived), with the certificate and private key clearly visible. These are used to encrypt HTTP traffic with the printer, and is the sole thing standing in the way of tools like OrcaSlicer talking with authentication-enabled Bambu Lab printers.</p>

<p>Of course there is bone-simulation filament on the market. What’s fun about this Reddit thread is all of the semi-macabre concerns of surgeons who are worried about its properties matching the real thing to make practice rigs for difficult surgeries. We were initially creeped out by the idea, but now that we think about it, it’s entirely reassuring that surgeons have the best tools available for them to prepare, so why not 3D prints of the actual patient’s bones?</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Breaking verifiability and vote privacy in CHVote</strong><br>
<em>Véronique Cortier, Alexandre Debant, Pierrick Gaudry</em></p>
<p>Abstract. CHVote is one of the two main electronic voting systems developed in the context of political elections in Switzerland, where the regulation requires a specific setting and specific trust assumptions. We show that actually, CHVote fails to achieve vote secrecy and individual verifiability (here, recorded-as-intended), as soon as one of the online components is dishonest, contradicting the security claims of CHVote. In total, we found 9 attacks or variants against CHVote, 2 of them being based on a bug in the reference implementation. We confirmed our findings through a proof-of-concept implementation of our attacks.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Organizations face unprecedented challenges in 2025. Competitive pressures demand faster innovation. AI tools are becoming more and more ubiquitous. And leaders continue to demand more results and innovation while still cutting costs. Even with all these demands, many teams are also still struggling with the challenges of misalignment, poor visibility, and coordination overhead that cripple their performance. Talk about kicking us when we’re down.</p>
<p>In a previous post, we looked at how leaders can help wire their organizations for success by building high-performing teams through slowification, simplification, and amplification. In this post, we’ll look at how the practices of <em>Flow Engineering</em> and value stream mapping can help teams achieve better clarity, flow, and value.</p>

		<p>Khi làm việc nhóm, đặc biệt trong các dự án phát triển phần mềm, secrets như API keys, token, và mật khẩu đóng vai trò cốt lõi để kết nối và bảo mật hệ thống. Tuy nhiên, chính việc chia sẻ và quản lý secrets trong một đội ngũ đông người lại làm tăng nguy cơ rò rỉ thông tin.<br>
Vậy làm thế nào để giảm thiểu nguy cơ này? Dưới đây là một số giải pháp thiết thực giúp bạn bảo vệ secrets tốt hơn khi làm việc đội nhóm.</p>

		<p>CIS Control 6 merges some aspects of CIS Control 4 (admin privileges) and CIS Control 14 (access on a need-to-know basis) into a single access control management group. Access control management is a critical component in maintaining information and system security, restricting access to assets based on role and need. It is important to grant, refuse, and remove access in a standardized, timely, and repeatable way across an entire organization. Privileged accounts, such as administrators, should be protected with multi-factor authentication. Enforcing and maintaining access control policies&hellip;</p>
