(CVE-2024-10976) Jacob Champion discovered that PostgreSQL clients used untrusted server error messages. An attacker that is able to intercept network communications could possibly use this issue to inject error messages that could be interpreted as valid query results.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to view or change different rows from those intended.

<p>Introduction In a report published by Statista, cybercrime cost the world over $9 trillion in 2024 and is predicted to rise to nearly $14 trillion by 2028. These figures are a deep source of worry for governments and private businesses about what’s next in the cyber threat landscape. The problem is that cyber threats are rising in both volume and scale. More so, the major threats are directed at emerging technologies, aiming to capitalize on weaknesses in emerging AI and ML systems. Cyber threats increasingly play a role in international conflicts, such as the recent reports of the “salt&hellip;</p>
