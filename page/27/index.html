<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 6, 2025</p>
<p>The financial technology (FinTech) industry continues to grow as digital solutions reshape banking, payments, and investments. In 2025, technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and changing consumer expectations will drive new developments in FinTech app solutions.</p>
<p>With the rise in cyber threats, financial apps are prioritizing security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometric verification, and AI-driven threat detection are becoming standard. Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that cybercrime damage will hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, making security a top concern for FinTech firms.</p>

Right on schedule, a new update to the Mozilla Firefox web browser is available for download. Last month’s Firefox 134 release saw the New Tab page layout refreshed for users in the United States, let Linux go hands-on with touch-hold gestures, seeded Ecosia search engine, and fine-tuned the performance of the built-in pop-up blocker. Firefox 135, as is probably intuit, brings an equally sizeable set of changes to the fore including a wider rollout of its new New Tab page layout to all locales where Stories are available: It’s not a massive makeover, granted. But the new layout adjusts the […]</p>

Some of us might remember this 15-year-old <em>Abstruse Goose</em> comic about our choices in life. Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics – or as it’s often somewhat erroneously labeled – physics. Many years ago, I did a course on rigid body dynamics that was definitely a part of the theoretical mechanics curriculum, not physics! Then, you’ll probably also need a bit of materials science, optics, and a smattering of other subjects. The good news is you’ll have loads of fun along the way. And while you’re still learning, game development engines and libraries can help you keep on top of some of the accidental complexity and give you enough functionality to implement the things you want, albeit at a fairly basic level.</p>
