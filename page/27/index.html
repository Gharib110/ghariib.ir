<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As a platform engineer at a mid-size startup, I’m responsible for identifying bottlenecks and developing solutions to streamline engineering operations to keep up with the velocity and scale of the engineering organization. In this post, I outline some of the challenges we faced with one of our clients, how we addressed them, and provide guides on how to tackle these challenges at your company.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At Docker, we are committed to ensuring that Docker Hub remains the best place for developers, engineering teams, and operations teams to build, share, and collaborate. As part of this, we previously announced plans to introduce image pull consumption fees and storage-based billing. After further evaluating how developers use Docker Hub and what will best support the ecosystem, we have refined our approach—one that prioritizes developer experience and enables developers to scale with confidence while reinforcing Docker Hub as the foundation of the cloud-native ecosystem.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Modern software development emphasizes speed and agility, making efficient testing crucial. DORA research reveals that elite teams thrive with both high performance and reliability. They can achieve 127x faster lead times, 182x more deployments per year, 8x lower change failure rates and most impressively, 2,293x faster recovery times after incidents. The secret sauce is they “shift left.” </p>
<p>Shift-Left is a practice that moves integration activities like testing and security earlier in the development cycle, allowing teams to detect and fix issues before they reach production. By incorporating local and integration tests early, developers can prevent costly late-stage defects, accelerate development, and improve software quality. </p>
