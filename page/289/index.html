		<p>Securing an event of the magnitude of AWS re:Invent—the Amazon Web Services annual conference in Las Vegas—is no small feat. The most recent event, in December, operated on the scale of a small city, spanning seven venues over twelve miles and nearly seven million square feet across the bustling Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Keeping all 60,000 in-person attendees, 400,000 online participants, and their data secure requires a sophisticated blend of physical and logical security measures—a challenge that we’ve addressed by building an integrated security strategy that brings both sides together. We used every resource available to us, including drones, K9 units, our network security teams, and much more, to help protect every person attending the event and their data.</p>

<p>Here we are a quarter of the way through the 21st century and the rate of change in technology shows no signs of slowing. And, while we are not quite the jet-setting hipsters that cartoons of the 1960’s predicted, we are living in a world where everything and everyone is connected. We all want our technology to work seamlessly, frictionless, and securely.</p>

<p>Sheet metal is very easy to form, including the pressing in of intricate shapes with dies and a hydraulic press, but the dies themselves are slightly harder to come by. What if we could 3D print custom dies to stamp logos and more into sheet metal? This is the premise of a recent video by the <em>Stick Shift Garage</em> channel on YouTube in which dies are printed in PLA+ (solid infill) and used to stamp 1 and 2 mm thick sheet metal with the channel’s logo.</p>

	<div>
		<p>What is Space Bears? Space Bear is a relatively new ransomware group that first appeared on the radar in April 2024. The gang, which is aligned to the Phobos ransomware-as-a-service group, steals sensitive data from organisations, encrypts victims&rsquo; computer systems, and demands that a ransom be paid for a decryption key or the data will be published on the dark web. So far, so normal. What makes Space Bears noteworthy? Space Bears has gained a certain amount of notoriety by the way in which it presents itself. Unlike other ransomware gangs, Space Bears presents a very &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; image of&hellip;</p>

		<p>By using Python libraries in Excel, you can automate tasks, build dashboards, and more.</p>
<p>While Excel is a powerful tool for data management and analysis, it often feels limited when dealing with complex data transformations, large datasets, and repetitive tasks. Here is where Python comes into play. By integrating Python libraries into your workflow, you can unlock its true potential.</p>

A new alpha update to System76’s COSMIC desktop environment has arrived with a clutch of interactive improvements. This is the fifth alpha of the Rust-based DE since August 2024. More alphas will arrive each month until all the features planned to ship in the first stable release – or ‘epoch’, as System76 is calling them – are in place, at which point beta testing will begin. Arriving alongside this alpha is a refreshed ISO of Pop!_OS 24.04 (Alpha) with COSMIC Alpha 5 preinstalled — but, just like previous COSMIC desktop alpha releases, users of other Linux distributions, like Arch Linux, […]</p>

		<p>A must-have for the monitor aficionado.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it hard to use a PC unless it has two monitors. It&rsquo;s just nice to have something on the side while I&rsquo;m working away on the main monitor. Some people have a need for five monitors, and I can&rsquo;t even wrap my head around how I&rsquo;d even begin to use that number of screens, but I respect (and fear) the people who do. If you&rsquo;re one who enjoys multiple monitors, you&rsquo;ll like this new Plugable dock announced at CES 2025 that can handle your love for a huge array of screens.</p>

		<p>There are thousands of apps on the list, and you probably have at least some of them installed.</p>
<p>We all know that apps collect our data, but what do companies do with that data? Some sell it, some use it for targeted advertising, some use it to help you connect with other users nearby, and there are countless other ways it can be used too. In a nightmare scenario, a firm that collects that data from thousands of apps has been hacked, with the hackers threatening to release all of the data publicly. This data includes customer lists, information about the industry, and historical location information collected from smartphones.</p>
