	<div>
		<p>A change may be coming in the way you&rsquo;ll be paying for Apple Care. Apple doesn&rsquo;t approve of an app that it has approved—semantics are at the heart of a porn app problem. DeepSeek is this past week&rsquo;s big artificial intelligence story. What&rsquo;s different about this new AI contender? Does it secure your data? And Apple&rsquo;s new Invites app doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too inviting.</p>
<p>The post DeepSeek, AppleCare, and Did Apple Approve a Porn App in the EU? appeared first on The Mac Security Blog.</p>

<h3 id="31-affected-products">3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS</h3>
<p>The following versions of Elber Communications Equipment are affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signum DVB-S/S2 IRD: Versions 1.999 and prior</li>
<li>Cleber/3 Broadcast Multi-Purpose Platform: Version 1.0</li>
<li>Reble610 M/ODU XPIC IP-ASI-SDH: Version 0.01</li>

<h4 id="321-authentication-bypass-using-an-alternate-path-or-channel-cwe-288"><strong>3.2.1</strong> <strong>Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel CWE-288</strong></h4>
<p>Multiple Elber products are affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability which allows unauthorized access to the password management functionality. Attackers can exploit this issue by manipulating the endpoint to overwrite any user&rsquo;s password within the system. This grants them unauthorized administrative access to protected areas of the application, compromising the device&rsquo;s system security.</p>

		<p>The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA, or CRA for short) is coming. I’ve talked about this piece of upcoming regulation in some depth before, having covered its background and stipulations in previous pieces on our website and for the Forbes Technology Council, and explored what it means for the businesses who consume open source in later articles (you can also read a version of this blog on Forbes). However, with the clock ticking and time running out to make your devices and software compliant with the Act’s new cybersecurity requirements, I thought I’d talk about how you should be approaching your device design and cybersecurity foundation. In this blog, I’ll run through a blueprint for cybersecurity, and outline what you should be doing to meet EU CRA compliance if you’re an IoT or device manufacturer. </p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 6, 2025</p>
<p>The financial technology (FinTech) industry continues to grow as digital solutions reshape banking, payments, and investments. In 2025, technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and changing consumer expectations will drive new developments in FinTech app solutions.</p>
<p>With the rise in cyber threats, financial apps are prioritizing security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometric verification, and AI-driven threat detection are becoming standard. Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that cybercrime damage will hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, making security a top concern for FinTech firms.</p>

Right on schedule, a new update to the Mozilla Firefox web browser is available for download. Last month’s Firefox 134 release saw the New Tab page layout refreshed for users in the United States, let Linux go hands-on with touch-hold gestures, seeded Ecosia search engine, and fine-tuned the performance of the built-in pop-up blocker. Firefox 135, as is probably intuit, brings an equally sizeable set of changes to the fore including a wider rollout of its new New Tab page layout to all locales where Stories are available: It’s not a massive makeover, granted. But the new layout adjusts the […]</p>
