	<div>
		<p>What is Space Bears? Space Bear is a relatively new ransomware group that first appeared on the radar in April 2024. The gang, which is aligned to the Phobos ransomware-as-a-service group, steals sensitive data from organisations, encrypts victims&rsquo; computer systems, and demands that a ransom be paid for a decryption key or the data will be published on the dark web. So far, so normal. What makes Space Bears noteworthy? Space Bears has gained a certain amount of notoriety by the way in which it presents itself. Unlike other ransomware gangs, Space Bears presents a very &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; image of&hellip;</p>

		<p>By using Python libraries in Excel, you can automate tasks, build dashboards, and more.</p>
<p>While Excel is a powerful tool for data management and analysis, it often feels limited when dealing with complex data transformations, large datasets, and repetitive tasks. Here is where Python comes into play. By integrating Python libraries into your workflow, you can unlock its true potential.</p>

A new alpha update to System76’s COSMIC desktop environment has arrived with a clutch of interactive improvements. This is the fifth alpha of the Rust-based DE since August 2024. More alphas will arrive each month until all the features planned to ship in the first stable release – or ‘epoch’, as System76 is calling them – are in place, at which point beta testing will begin. Arriving alongside this alpha is a refreshed ISO of Pop!_OS 24.04 (Alpha) with COSMIC Alpha 5 preinstalled — but, just like previous COSMIC desktop alpha releases, users of other Linux distributions, like Arch Linux, […]</p>

		<p>A must-have for the monitor aficionado.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it hard to use a PC unless it has two monitors. It&rsquo;s just nice to have something on the side while I&rsquo;m working away on the main monitor. Some people have a need for five monitors, and I can&rsquo;t even wrap my head around how I&rsquo;d even begin to use that number of screens, but I respect (and fear) the people who do. If you&rsquo;re one who enjoys multiple monitors, you&rsquo;ll like this new Plugable dock announced at CES 2025 that can handle your love for a huge array of screens.</p>

		<p>There are thousands of apps on the list, and you probably have at least some of them installed.</p>
<p>We all know that apps collect our data, but what do companies do with that data? Some sell it, some use it for targeted advertising, some use it to help you connect with other users nearby, and there are countless other ways it can be used too. In a nightmare scenario, a firm that collects that data from thousands of apps has been hacked, with the hackers threatening to release all of the data publicly. This data includes customer lists, information about the industry, and historical location information collected from smartphones.</p>

<p>It is old news that you can print PCB artwork on glossy paper and use a clothes iron to transfer the toner to a copper board, which will resist etchant. But [Squalius] shows us how to do a similar trick with 3D prints in a recent video, which you can see below.</p>
<p>The example used is a QR code, although you can use anything you can print in a mirror image. Of course, heat from a clothes iron isn’t going to be compatible with your 3D-printed plastic. The trick is to use some acrylic medium on the part, place the print face down, and apply more medium to the back of the paper.</p>
