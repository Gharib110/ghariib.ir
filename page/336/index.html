<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The modern-day cyber threat landscape is marked by the rise in malware variants that give attackers the green light to gain complete remote control over targeted systems, such as a nefarious Remcos RAT spread via a phishing attack vector. At the turn of January 2025, defenders unveiled an emerging stealthy malware dubbed NonEuclid RAT, which [‚Ä¶]</p>

		<p><strong>What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Why It&rsquo;s Transforming DevOps</strong></p>
<p>In the fast-evolving world of DevOps, where agility, scalability, and automation are paramount, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a game-changing paradigm. But what exactly is IaC, and why is it revolutionizing the way we approach infrastructure management in the software development lifecycle?</p>
<h3 id="what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac"><strong>What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?</strong></h3>
<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Simply put, IaC allows developers and operations teams to write and execute code to define, deploy, and maintain infrastructure.</p>

Miniaturization is making these devices harder to detect. Presumably AI will soon obviate the need for an accomplice.</p>

		<p>Eight technologies developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, either wholly or in collaboration with researchers from other organizations, were among the winners of the 2020 R&amp;D 100 Awards. Annually since 1963, these international R&amp;D awards recognize 100 technologies that a panel of expert judges selects as the most revolutionary of the past year.</p>
<p>Six of the laboratory‚Äôs winning technologies are software systems, a number of which take advantage of artificial intelligence techniques. The software technologies are solutions to difficulties inherent in analyzing large volumes of data and to problems in maintaining cybersecurity. Another technology is a process designed to assure secure fabrication of integrated circuits, and the eighth winner is an optical communications technology that may enable future space missions to transmit error-free data to Earth at significantly higher rates than currently possible.</p>
