<p>As you may know, GNOME is moving to GTK4 + LibAdwaita in recent years. Core apps are either ported to the new frameworks or replaced with new ones.</p>
<p>GNOMOE Text Editor, GNOME Camera, GNOME Console, and Loupe replaced Gedit, Cheese, GNOME Terminal, and Eyes of GNOME as default text editor, camera app, terminal, and image viewer. And, it introduced Decibels as new core app for playing audio files.</p>
<p>Now Papers enters GNOME Incubator, expects to replace Evince as default PDF and Document viewer.</p>

		<h2 id="what-are-passkeys">What are passkeys?</h2>
<p>You may have seen the term “passkeys” appearing more frequently in tech news, app updates, and security discussions. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are rolling out passkeys as a replacement for passwords, promising both enhanced security and a smoother user experience. But what exactly are passkeys, and why are they considered the future of authentication?</p>
<p>With Password Day coming up this Saturday, it’s the perfect time to discuss the future of authentication. Passwords have long been the foundation of online security, but they come with significant downsides: they can be stolen, guessed, or reused across multiple sites. Enter passkeys, a next-generation authentication technology designed to replace passwords entirely with a more secure and user-friendly alternative.</p>

		<p>Empowering development teams with self-service and automation capabilities has long been a goal for organizations seeking to reduce bottlenecks and speed up innovation. However, many traditional approaches to self-service fall short, bogged down by ticket queues and overwhelmed operations teams. Additionally, a lack of ownership in maintaining component catalogs, lack of product mindset and constant changes to curated technologies are some of the key reasons that platform engineering initiatives fail in many organizations.For development teams tasked to develop and maintain software solutions,</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Polynomial Inversion Algorithms in Constant Time for Post-Quantum Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Abhraneel Dutta, Emrah Karagoz, Edoardo Persichetti, Pakize Sanal</em></p>
<p>The computation of the inverse of a polynomial over a quotient ring or a finite field plays a very important role during the key generation of post-quantum cryptosystems like NTRU, BIKE, and LEDACrypt. It is therefore important that there exist an efficient algorithm capable of running in constant time, to prevent timing side-channel attacks. In this article, we study both constant-time algorithms based on Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem and the Extended $GCD$ Algorithm, and provide a detailed comparison in terms of performance. According to our conclusion, we see that the constant-time Extended $GCD$-based Bernstein-Yang&rsquo;s algorithm shows a better performance with 1.76x-3.76x on texttt{x86} platforms compared to FLT-based methods. Although we report numbers from a software implementation, we additionally provide a short glimpse of some recent results when these two algorithms are implemented on various hardware platforms. Finally, we also explore other exponentiation algorithms that work similarly to the Itoh-Tsuji inversion method. These algorithms perform fewer polynomial multiplications and show a better performance with 1.56x-1.96x on texttt{x86} platform compared to Itoh-Tsuji inversion method.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 5, 2025</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that global cybercrime damages will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. This staggering figure highlights the urgent need for enhanced defenses against ransomware, phishing attacks, and emerging threats like deepfake-based fraud.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are revolutionizing cybersecurity. On the one hand, AI-powered tools enable faster threat detection, real-time incident response, and predictive analytics. Tools like machine learning-driven intrusion detection systems can identify anomalies with unprecedented accuracy, helping organizations mitigate risks before they escalate.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Today, we are thrilled to announce the integration of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) provenance standard into Cloudflare Images. Content creators and publishers can seamlessly preserve the entire provenance chain — from how an image was created and by whom, to every subsequent edit — across the Cloudflare network.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-c2pa-and-the-content-authenticity-initiative">What is the C2PA and the Content Authenticity Initiative?</h3>
<p>When you hear the word provenance, you might have flashbacks to your high school Art History class. In that context, it means that the artwork you see at the Met in New York really came from the artist in question and isn’t a fake. Its provenance is how that piece of physical art changed possession over time, from the original artist all the way to the museum. </p>
