<p>Just when you think you’ve learned all the latest 3D printing tricks, [TenTech] shows up with an update to their Fuzzyficator post-processing script. This time, the GPL v3 licensed program has gained early support for “paint-on” textures.</p>
<p>Fuzzyficator works as a plugin to OrcaSlicer, Bambu Studio, and PrusaSlicer. The process starts with an image that acts as a displacement map. Displacement map pixel colors represent how much each point on the print surface will be moved from its original position. Load the displacement map into Fuzzyficator, and you can paint the pattern on the surface right in the slicer.</p>

		<p>Finally, a storage medium that can give me tinnitus.</p>
<p>While people usually get started on a project to solve a problem or explore a new place, some of them are done because &ldquo;well, why not?&rdquo; For example, someone has devised a way to store and retrieve data from their PC to a cassette tape with the aid of a 56K modem, and while it&rsquo;s a ton easier to just stick the file on a USB drive and call it a day, you can&rsquo;t deny that this method is pretty darn cool.</p>

<p>At the height of the Cold War, those of us on the western side of the wall had plenty of choice over our radio listening, even if we stuck with our country’s monolithic broadcaster. On the other side in the Soviet Union, radio for many came without a choice of source, in the form of wired radio systems built into all apartments. [Railways | Retro Tech | DIY] grew up familiar with these wired radios, and treats us to a fascinating examination of their technology, programming, and ultimate decline.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates the creation of a containerized API management system for querying real-time sports data. The system uses Amazon ECS (Fargate) for container orchestration, Amazon API Gateway for RESTful endpoints, and integrates seamlessly with an external Sports API. The implementation emphasizes best practices in cloud computing, including API management, container orchestration, and secure AWS service integration.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>Sports API Key</strong></p>
<p>Register for a free account at serpapi.com and obtain your API key for accessing sports data.</p>

<p>Handhelds are designed to be portable, but what if you need something smaller than OEM? The Steam Brick pulls basically everything off of a Steam Deck to make it as portable as possible.</p>
<p>[crastinator-pro] found they rarely used the controller or screen on their Steam Deck, and the form factor was too bulky to conveniently chuck into their bag, negating the advantage of owning a portable console. As to be expected from any self-respecting hacker, they did a couple quick tests with components unplugged then got to work with the rotary tool.</p>

<p>As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems become more prevalent, their ability to make decisions that impact our lives — ranging from healthcare diagnoses to loan approvals — has grown exponentially. However, the complexity of these systems often makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust, ethical concerns, and regulatory challenges. Testing for explainability in AI/ML is a critical practice that ensures these systems provide clear, understandable, and interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. By prioritizing explainability, organizations can build trust, ensure compliance, and create AI/ML systems that are both powerful and accountable.</p>

		<p>The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is decentralized blockchain technology, it is secure and transparent which provides an alternative to centralized internet cloud providers.</p>
<p>ICP maintains an independent data center that aims to bring efficient data, speed, and decentralization to computation and data storage. Internet Computer protocol uses ICP as its native cryptocurrency which is used to pay transaction fees, rewards, incentives, and other transactions. Users can build their DApps on ICP, which allows developers to write their smart contracts in different popular languages like Rust, TypeScript, or Python. The smart contract is regarded as canisters which are hosted on an ICP blockchain network called subnet.</p>

</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are leveraging artificial intelligence to launch phishing attacks that are more sophisticated, convincing, and dangerous than ever before. These AI-generated scams go beyond traditional techniques, creating highly personalized messages that mimic the tone, style, and context of real-world communications. Executives, in particular, are prime targets for these attacks, as they hold the keys to sensitive information and decision-making power within their organizations.</p>
