A ‘fresh new look’ is heading to Bodhi Linux, the Ubuntu-based Linux distribution built around the Moksha desktop, a fork of Enlightenment 17. Noting that the look of recent releases has leaned towards the dark side—no, not that one, Darth—the team has decide to give the next release a lighter visual revamp by making a new theme, called Zenithal, default. “Zenithal, developed by Štefan Uram and based on the Ice theme by Simotek, introduces a polished light aesthetic that brings a fresh energy to Moksha.

<p>In a digital landscape hungry for the next big thing in Artificial Intelligence, a new contender called DeepSeek recently burst onto the scene and has quickly gained traction for its advanced language models.</p>
<p>Positioned as a low-cost alternative to industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, DeepSeek has drawn attention for its rapid growth, affordability, and potential to reshape the AI landscape.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a recent investigation by McAfee Labs found that the same hype is now fueling a barrage of malware attacks disguised as DeepSeek software and updates.</p>

<p>Upon loading the screen, we are presented with a file upload and a button to make a jpeg icon. We also note that the version string indicates it was made in 2016, with a version of <code>Version 2016.3717</code>. After playing around with it for a little while, I thought about how there was that ImageMagick bug last year that let you execute code remotely. I wasn’t sure it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>
