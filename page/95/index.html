	<div>
		<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, precision medicine stands as a beacon of hope, promising tailored treatments that cater to our unique genetic makeup. Yet, despite its potential, many individuals find themselves grappling with the complexities surrounding polygenic risk scores (PRS) — powerful tools designed to predict disease susceptibility based on multiple genetic factors. Are you one of those who feel overwhelmed by medical jargon or unsure about how these scores could impact your health journey? You’re not alone; countless patients and practitioners alike face significant barriers in understanding and implementing PRS effectively. This blog post aims to demystify polygenic risk scores while addressing common challenges such as accessibility, education gaps, and ethical considerations that hinder their widespread use. Through insightful case studies showcasing successful applications of PRS and a forward-looking perspective on future advancements in this field, we will explore how you can harness these insights for better health outcomes. Join us as we unlock the door to precision medicine together—your pathway to informed decisions awaits!</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-0366<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 1, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 days, 1 hour ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.7 via the get_svg() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution. In this specific case, an attacker can create a form that allows SVG uploads, upload an SVG file with malicious content and then include the SVG file in a post to achieve remote code execution. This means it is relatively easy to gain remote code execution as a contributor-level user and above by default.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>

GNOME has announced a change to its default UI and monospace fonts ahead of the upcoming GNOME 48 release — a typographic turnabout that won’t impact Ubuntu users directly, though. Should you feel a sense of deja vu here it’s because GNOME trialled a font switch last year, during development of GNOME 47. Back then, it replaced its home-grown Cantarell font with the popular open-source sans Inter font (trivia: used by Zorin OS). The change was reverted prior to the GNOME 47 due to various UI quirks, coverage issues, and compatibility (thus underlying the importance of testing things out prior […]</p>
