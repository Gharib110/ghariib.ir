		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Error floor prediction with Markov models for QC-MDPC codes</strong><br>
<em>Sarah Arpin, Jun Bo Lau, Ray Perlner, Angela Robinson, Jean-Pierre Tillich, Valentin Vasseur</em></p>
<p>Quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity check (QC-MDPC) code-based encryption schemes under iterative decoders offer highly-competitive performance in the quantum-resistant space of cryptography, but the decoding-failure rate (DFR) of these algorithms are not well-understood. The DFR decreases extremely rapidly as the ratio of code-length to error-bits increases, then decreases much more slowly in regimes known as the waterfall and error-floor, respectively.</p>

		<p>As a data security global black belt, I help organizations secure AI solutions. They are concerned about data oversharing, data leaks, compliance, and other potential risks. Microsoft Purview is Microsoft’s solution for securing and governing data in generative AI.</p>
<p>I’m often asked how long it takes to deploy Microsoft Purview. The answer depends on the specifics of the organization and what they want to achieve. Microsoft Purview should enable a comprehensive data governance program but it can provide risk mitigation for generative AI in the short term while the program is underway.</p>

<p>You’ve probably noticed that everywhere you go — the doctor’s office, hotels, or retail shops, there are tiny PCs everywhere. These small PCs often show up on the surplus market for a very good price, but they aren’t quite full-blown PCs. They usually have little option for expansion and are made to be cheap and small. That means many of them have custom and anemic power supplies. We aren’t sure if [bm_00] needed a regular power supply to handle a graphics card or if the original power supply died, but either way, the HP small-form-factor box needed a new power supply. It took some clever work to be able to use a normal power supply in the little box.</p>

		<p>Turn your old USB flash drive into a secure unlock key for additional PC security.</p>
<p>Keeping your PC secure these days can be tricky. If you rely solely on a PIN or password, your system is more vulnerable to unwanted access. With Windows Hello integration, which introduces biometric data, things have improved. But if your PC doesn’t offer it, or you want something tangible, you might want another solution. However, you might not want to buy a dedicated security key like a YubiKey or a Thetis FIDO U2F. However, have you considered turning that old USB drive in your drawer into a secure unlock key instead?</p>

<p>In his most recent article, [Ken Shirriff] takes a break from putting ASICs under a microscope, and instead does the same in a proverbial manner with the word ‘mainframe’. Although these days the word ‘mainframe’ brings to mind a lumbering behemoth of a system that probably handles things like finances and other business things, but originally the ‘main frame’ was just one of many ‘frames’. Which brings us to the early computer systems.</p>

Do you use the official Spotify DEB on Ubuntu (or an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution like Linux Mint)? If so, you’ll be used to receiving updates to the Spotify Linux client direct from the official Spotify APT repo, right alongside all your other DEB-based software. Thing is: if you haven’t checked for updates from the command line recently you might not be aware the that security key used to ‘sign’ packages from the Spotify APT repo stopped working at the end of last year. Annoying, but not catastrophic as it—thankfully—doesn’t stop the Spotify Linux app from working just pollutes terminal output […]</p>

		<p>In the previous article, Linux on Arm (aarch64) servers&hellip;, we examined flat networks. That is, we used only bare network interfaces and nothing else. That&rsquo;s a good start, but it is often not the topology used, especially with solutions like OpenStack. So in this installment, let’s evaluate how impactful VXLAN encapsulation can be for throughput and CPU consumption.</p>
<p>We’ll reuse the hosts and testing procedures, with only the modifications to add VXLAN. For details on the test environment, please refer to the previously mentioned article.</p>

		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Imagine walking into a Monday morning only to find your company’s server grinding to a halt. CPU and memory usage are maxed out, services are timing out, and your team is panicking. This was my reality when I discovered a crypto miner malware (<em>perfectl</em>) had hijacked our server. What followed was a battle against resource-hogging processes, undeletable files, and a crash course in Linux file attributes. Here’s how I fought back—and what I learned along the way.</p>

		<p>WhatsApp revealed on Friday that a “zero-click” spyware attack, attributed to the Israeli firm Paragon, has targeted scores of users worldwide, including journalists and members of civil society.</p>
<p>The spyware targeted nearly 100 WhatsApp users, including journalists, and did not require any user interaction, nor did it require clicking links or opening attachments, making it particularly insidious.</p>
<p>In a statement, WhatsApp spokesperson confirmed with Cyber Security News that it had dismantled the attack vector, alerted affected users, and taken steps to notify the public about the breach.</p>
