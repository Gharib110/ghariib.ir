		<p>In the world of Kubernetes, managing traffic and securing APIs are critical tasks for any DevOps professional. This guide is the first in a three-part series designed to streamline your journey into modern application architecture:</p>
<p>Part 1: Deploying Traefik as an Ingress Controller</p>
<p>Part 2: Configuring KrakenD as an API Gateway.</p>
<p>Part 3: Building services that leverage Traefik and KrakenD for seamless traffic management and API integration.</p>
<p>In this first part, we will focus on deploying Traefik, a powerful Ingress Controller that simplifies external traffic management within Kubernetes environments. Whether you&rsquo;re experimenting with Kubernetes or managing production workloads, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to integrate Traefik effectively.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Dynamically Available Common Subset</strong><br>
<em>Yuval Efron, Ertem Nusret Tas</em></p>
<p>Internet-scale consensus protocols used by blockchains are designed to remain operational in the presence of unexpected temporary crash faults (the so-called sleepy model of consensus) &ndash; a critical feature for the latency-sensitive financial applications running on these systems. However, their leader-based architecture, where a single block proposer is responsible for creating the block at each height, makes them vulnerable to short-term censorship attacks, in which the proposers profit at the application layer by excluding certain transactions. In this work, we introduce an atomic broadcast protocol, secure in the sleepy model, that ensures the inclusion of all transactions within a constant expected time, provided that at least one participating node is non-censoring at all times. Unlike traditional approaches, our protocol avoids designating a single proposer per block height, instead leveraging a so-called dynamically available common subset (DACS) protocol &ndash; the first of its kind in the sleepy model. Additionally, our construction guarantees deterministic synchronization &ndash; once an honest node confirms a block, all other honest nodes do so within a constant time, thus addressing a shortcoming of many low-latency sleepy protocols.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-fedramp-moderate-and-transition-to-rev5">Understanding FedRAMP Moderate and transition to Rev.5</h2>
<p>FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a government program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services for U.S. state and federal agencies. The FedRAMP Moderate baseline is designed to protect sensitive data that, if compromised, could seriously adversely affect operations, assets, or individuals.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>
<p>FedRAMP Revision 5 (Rev.5) prioritizes customizing security controls for specific risks. It aligns with Cloud Service Providers, providing a baseline while allowing tailored adjustments for individual federal agencies. FedRAMP adopts a threat-based approach to security controls. Rather than a one-size-fits-all model, this methodology tailors controls based on specific threats and risks. The result is a more effective security posture.</p>

		<p>Software development has become increasingly complex. Developers are asked to do everything from addressing incidents and configuring cloud services to navigating a sprawl of microservices and components to complying with niche regulations and beyond. This is further compounded by increasing cross-functional collaboration across distributed teams.</p>
<p>Atlassian is committed to helping developers better manage this complexity by bringing disconnected information and teams together in one place. By reducing the toil of information gathering and coordination, we help developers get back to what they love – problem-solving, writing code, and learning.</p>
