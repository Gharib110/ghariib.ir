		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming the backbone of modern software development, fueling developer efficiency and accelerating innovation. With the emergence of AI agents implementing code based on instructions from humans, we are learning that implementing AI-based features has its own unique set of security challenges. <strong>How do we protect access to the resources AI needs, protect confidentiality, and avoid privilege escalation</strong>? Few organizations are ready to answer these questions today. At GitLab, we are. We are introducing a new paradigm for identity management: composite identities.</p>

		<p>Conducting security scans is a regular part of any software development process. Whether scanning source code (e.g., Java, Python, or other languages), configuration files (e.g., YAML files), or container images, these scanning tools help development teams be proactive about understanding and addressing security threats.</p>
<p>Traditionally, developers run these security scans as part of CI/CD pipelines. By including these scans in CI/CD, every change to a project will be reviewed to see if any vulnerabilities are introduced. Understanding security concerns during development helps to assure that changes are addressed before they are deployed to a live environment, but there are many additional benefits to conducting container vulnerability scans post deployment as well.</p>

Well, as it turns out, people have been getting games working on their Samsung Galaxy Watches, and the performance has been impressively solid.</p>

		<p>This past year, over 800 community members have made more than 3,000 contributions to GitLab. These contributors include team members from global organizations like Thales and Scania, who are helping shape GitLab&rsquo;s future through the Co-Create Program — GitLab&rsquo;s collaborative development program where customers work directly with GitLab engineers to contribute meaningful features to the platform.</p>
<p>Through workshops, pair programming sessions, and ongoing support, program participants get hands-on experience with GitLab&rsquo;s architecture and codebase while solving issues or improving existing features.</p>

		<p>Empowering humanitarian action with open source: A natural language search tool for UN Resolutions.</p>
<p>The post 4 steps to building a natural language search tool appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p><strong>“We have a problem. Our current search method for sifting through PDFs is extremely manual and time consuming. Is there an easier way?”</strong></p>
<p>As a developer, this is one of those questions that really gets me excited. I was tasked with finding a way to transform a cumbersome, archival process into an efficient, intuitive search experience. It’s a way to make a group of people’s lives easier, and because of the organizations they work for, help them be more effective in providing humanitarian assistance to people in need around the world. I couldn’t imagine a better project to be working on.</p>
