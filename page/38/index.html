<p>If your website is targeting multiple states or countries, by default, you face a double-pronged challenge: adapting to regional regulatory demands while defending against sophisticated cyber threats. Tackling this requires localization. But what does the term actually entail? Localization isn’t just about tailoring products, services, and infrastructure to meet local market requirements; it has emerged as a critical tool for compliance and cybersecurity threat mitigation. Strategic localization can address supply chain vulnerabilities, enhance regional threat intelligence, and foster&hellip;</p>

<p>Critical infrastructure organizations bear an enormous responsibility. The assets, systems, and networks they manage are crucial to the functioning of a healthy society. They provide water, energy, transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, and more—should they fail, they would bring entire countries to their knees. The vast importance of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) makes it a prime target for cybercriminals. Research from early this year even found that global critical infrastructure suffered 13 cyberattacks every second in 2023. And things are only likely to get worse: the&hellip;</p>
