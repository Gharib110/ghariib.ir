		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-21629<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 15, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 2 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:</p>
<p>net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets</p>
<p>The blamed commit disabled hardware offoad of IPv6 packets with extension headers on devices that advertise NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM, based on the definition of that feature in skbuff.h:</p>
<p>* * - %NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM * - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain * TCP or UDP packets over IPv6. These are specifically * unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or * IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6 * header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers * are not supported with this feature. This feature * cannot be set in features for a device with * NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being * DEPRECATED (see below).</p>

A new stable release of Flatpak is out with a wealth of improvements in tow. Flatpak 1.16.0 is the first stable release in the new 1.16.x series, coming more than two years after the Flatpak 1.14.x cycle began and containing features, fixes, and other work undertaken from the 1.15.x development releases. Such as? Well, the way that Flatpak apps access USB devices is improved in Flatpak 1.16.x thanks to a new input device permission. Developer Georges Basile Stavracas notes that this is “technically still a sandbox hole that should be treated with caution” but enables apps to purposefully limit the scope […]</p>

		<p>Windows 10&rsquo;s end-of-support date will affect more than just the operating system.</p>
<p>With Windows 10&rsquo;s end-of-year date approaching this October, people still using the operating system have been given a choice: upgrade to Windows 11 or lose support. People have devised solutions for the latter path, including third-party apps that will keep the OS secure. However, it seems that people sticking with Windows 10 will also lose Microsoft 365 support.</p>

		<p>Goodbye, BYOVD attacks.</p>
<p>Happy 2025! Microsoft has rolled out the first big updates for Windows 10 and 11 for the year, but don&rsquo;t get too excited. Across the board, we&rsquo;re seeing security fixes for the operating system, which, while very useful for warding off attacks, doesn&rsquo;t really get me excited to give it a spin. However, if you&rsquo;re a fan of Roblox, you may notice some issues playing it in the future.</p>

<p>Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a “hacking-as-a-service” scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company’s platform for AI-generated content.</p>
<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use&hellip;</p>

<p>So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require a password.</p>
<p>In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I ran the service ­ during which no security breach occurred over my link. I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government and British Post Office representation&hellip;</p>
