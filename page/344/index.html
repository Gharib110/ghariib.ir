	<div>
		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-56412<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 45 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> PhpSpreadsheet is a PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. Versions prior to 3.7.0, 2.3.5, 2.1.6, and 1.29.7 are vulnerable to bypass of the cross-site scripting sanitizer using the javascript protocol and special characters. An attacker can use special characters, so that the library processes the javascript protocol with special characters and generates an HTML link. Versions 3.7.0, 2.3.5, 2.1.6, and 1.29.7 contain a patch for the issue.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 0.0 | NA<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-56514<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 45 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Karmada is a Kubernetes management system that allows users to run cloud-native applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds. Prior to version 1.12.0, both in karmadactl and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by Karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a Karmada initialization could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem. From Karmada version 1.12.0, when processing custom CRDs files, CRDs archive verification is utilized to enhance file system robustness. A workaround is available. Someone who needs to set flag `&ndash;crd` to customize the CRD files required for Karmada initialization when using `karmadactl init` to set up Karmada can manually inspect the CRD files to check whether they contain sequences such as `../` that would alter file paths, to determine if they potentially include malicious files. When using karmada-operator to set up Karmada, one must upgrade one&rsquo;s karmada-operator to one of the fixed versions.<br>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 45 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Trix is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get rich text editor for everyday writing. Versions prior to 2.1.12 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when pasting malicious code in the link field. An attacker could trick the user to copy&amp;paste a malicious `javascript:` URL as a link that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user&rsquo;s session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed. Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.12 or later to receive a patch. In addition to upgrading, affected users can disallow browsers that don&rsquo;t support a Content Security Policy (CSP) as a workaround for this and other cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Set CSP policies such as script-src &lsquo;self&rsquo; to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.<br>
