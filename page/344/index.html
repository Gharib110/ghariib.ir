		<p><strong>Welcome to My 30-Day Terraform Challenge Blog</strong></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Phenomena Ekuss, and I am a Network and cloud support engineer with a background in <strong>Networks and Communication systems</strong>. Over the years, I‚Äôve developed a passion for designing, managing, and optimizing network infrastructures while embracing the evolving world of cloud technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Why I‚Äôm Taking on the Terraform Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is transforming the way we think about and manage infrastructure in modern IT environments. As someone deeply invested in the intersection of networks and cloud systems, I believe Terraform is a must-have skill in my toolkit. This challenge is my opportunity to:</p>

Miniaturization is making these devices harder to detect. Presumably AI will soon obviate the need for an accomplice.</p>

		<p>Eight technologies developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, either wholly or in collaboration with researchers from other organizations, were among the winners of the 2020 R&amp;D 100 Awards. Annually since 1963, these international R&amp;D awards recognize 100 technologies that a panel of expert judges selects as the most revolutionary of the past year.</p>
<p>Six of the laboratory‚Äôs winning technologies are software systems, a number of which take advantage of artificial intelligence techniques. The software technologies are solutions to difficulties inherent in analyzing large volumes of data and to problems in maintaining cybersecurity. Another technology is a process designed to assure secure fabrication of integrated circuits, and the eighth winner is an optical communications technology that may enable future space missions to transmit error-free data to Earth at significantly higher rates than currently possible.</p>

		<p>At Tuta we are building a privacy-first alternative to big tech offerings so that everyone can protect their data online by sending encrypted emails and sharing encrypted events with Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar. This brings our service to the forefront of all kinds of adversaries. As a consequence, Tuta is regularly being attacked with DDoS attacks. While most of the times, we can fend off these attacks without you noticing, the adversaries changed their attack vectors beginning of December which led to several downtimes during the first week of December. We have now immensely improved our DDoS-protection methods and our systems are capable of fending off these attacks. Now, we would like explain what happened and how we mitigated the attacks.</p>
