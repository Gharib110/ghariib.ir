	<div>
		<p>For many years, software virtualization has allowed retailers to deliver improved store-based applications without the need to add hardware capacity. Customer-facing applications such as stock control and customer loyalty programs, and colleague-facing applications such as replenishment and staff rotas are critical to store success. As the number and complexity of store applications increases, retailers will frequently use hardware and software virtualization techniques to support the increased demands for capacity while avoiding the cost of supplying additional hardware. As retailers increas</p>

		<p>Hackers are exploiting two VMware vCenter Server flaws, one of which is a critical remote code execution flaw. Both vulnerabilities received security updates in September 2024, but the initial patches didn’t solve the problems completely. Thus, in October, VMware released a new patch to close the RCE vulnerability. Now security researchers warn users that they’ve […]</p>

Broadcom has released updates for VMware Workstation Pro for Windows and Linux, the first to arrive since the software became entirely free to use. Earlier this year, Broadcom made VMware Workstation Pro and its Mac equivalent Fusion Pro free for personal usage, and later for commercial usage. Anyone can download and install VMware’s desktop virtualisation software to use for whatever they want. — Assuming they have the patience to wade through rerouting links, portals, checkboxes, and dense documentation sites to locate the actual download. A blog post from a VMware team member walks through the 11 step (!) process. As […]</p>

A new year has started, and who knows what kind of innovations and improvements it holds for for Ubuntu, which remains the world’s most used desktop Linux operating system. We get 2 new releases of Ubuntu each year, one in April and one in October. Plus, new point releases of the latest long-term support release rolling up bug fixes, app updates, and back-porting newer Linux kernels and GPU drivers. So 2025 should be another golden year for Ubuntu, those of us using it, and the Linux and open-source community as a whole. Changes to Ubuntu in 2024 span a wide […]</p>

		<p>If you’re a Linux user, and you use distros such as Ubuntu or Debian, then you will have surely seen the command apt update. But what is it, exactly, and why do you want to run it often? In this article, we are going to break down the apt update command into simple words and explain what role it has in keeping your system running as it should.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-apt">What is apt?</h2>
<p><strong>APT</strong> is an acronym for <strong>Advanced Package Tool</strong>, and it is a command-line utility that allows us to handle software packages in Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu. An example of a package manager that you can use is called <code>apt</code> and is used to install, upgrade, and remove packages on your system.</p>
