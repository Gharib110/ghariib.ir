		<p>Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors, analyzes, and processes Amazon Web Services (AWS) data sources and logs in your AWS environment. GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, file hashes, and machine learning (ML) models to identify suspicious and potentially malicious activity in your AWS environment. When GuardDuty identifies a potential security issue, it creates a GuardDuty finding that gives you information about what the potential security issue is, the resources involved, and contextualized information that’s key to remediating the issue. GuardDuty helps you monitor for the latest threats by continually expanding threat detection to emerging and common threats.</p>

<p>We’ve said it before: building one-offs is different from building at scale. Even on a small scale. There was a time when it was rare for a hobbyist to produce more than one of anything, but these days, access to cheap PC boards makes small production runs much more common. [VoltLog], for example, is selling some modules and found he was spening a lot of time testing the boards. The answer? A testing jig for his PC board.</p>

<p>PC building can be a relatively drama-free affair. It’s never been easier to buy the parts and put them together yourself, but that doesn’t mean it’s always smooth sailing.

These 5 tasks are some of the most difficult, but there are some ways to make them less painful.</p>

<p>Johnston Retail Services has partnered with Privately SA to bring the AgeAI app to Ireland, helping to prevent vape sales to minors and avoid the risk of costly fines</p>
<p>20 November 2024 – Stores across Ireland can now benefit from a pioneering AI solution that can estimate someone’s age with almost 100% accuracy, thanks to a new partnership between Dublin’s Johnston Retail Services and SafetyTech company Privately SA.</p>
<p>Privately’s AgeAI app provides automated and highly accurate facial age estimation, removing the guesswork from age checks and mitigating the risk of fines for selling vapes to children. It is 100% anonymous, with no images transmitted or stored, GDPR certified, and helps protect staff by reducing the need for unnecessary ID checks for adults who are a source of major conflict.</p>
