<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-30204<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> March 21, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 31 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Prior to 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function&rsquo;s argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2.<br>
