		<p>In early 2024, we started a journey to implement better metrics for our internal Red Team. Our first iteration focused on what we now call the adoption rate metric, which measures how often the recommendations our team makes are accepted and implemented.</p>
<p>Choosing this metric was very deliberate. While there are many ways to measure a Red Team&rsquo;s impact, we wanted to start with something fundamental: Are we actually driving meaningful security improvements? The adoption rate directly ties our work to real security outcomes, and we could measure it using tools and processes we already had in place.</p>

		<p>The start of the email impacts how the email is interpreted by the recipient - like the subject line it plays a role in whether your email is read or not. Acing the beginning of an email can be tricky as the greeting changes depending on who you’re emailing and the reason for the email. While for many people the question of how to start off an email can be confusing, it does not need to be. By following our quick and simple guide, you can learn how to start the email perfectly while avoiding the common mistakes too!</p>

		<p>Our new <strong>DOKS routing agent</strong> is a managed component for configuring static routes on Kubernetes worker nodes. It is a direct response to user feedback on its predecessor, the static route operator, and introduces new features to enhance routing flexibility. Despite being a managed component, the DOKS routing agent is included <strong>at no additional cost</strong> for users.</p>

<h3 id="1-static-route-management-via-custom-resources">1. Static Route Management via Custom Resources</h3>
<p>The DOKS routing agent enables users to configure IP routes on their Kubernetes worker nodes using a dedicated Kubernetes Custom Resource. This is particularly useful for VPN setups or tunneling egress traffic through specific gateway nodes.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At DigitalOcean, we’re always working to make it easier for developers, startups, and AI-driven businesses to scale their operations with the high-powered compute they need. Today, we’re introducing Bare Metal systems based on the NVIDIA HGX H200 AI supercomputing platform, designed for high-performance AI workloads. Whether you’re training large-scale models, fine-tuning AI systems, or running real-time inference, NVIDIA H200 GPUs provide the power and flexibility to accelerate AI applications.</p>
<h2 id="why-h200">Why H200?</h2>
<p>Equipped with 8x NVIDIA HGX H200 systems, these machines deliver cutting-edge performance needed for modern AI workloads. NVIDIA H200 GPUs provide faster memory bandwidth, enhanced Tensor Core performance, and more efficient real-time inference, making them the ideal choice for large-scale AI deployments. With 141GB of HBM3e memory and a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s, you can tackle complex AI tasks more efficiently, reduce latency, and push your projects further, faster.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>DigitalOcean’s App Platform, our Platform as a Service offering, provides seamless integration with major Git providers, enabling developers to deploy applications directly from their repositories. App Platform can automatically analyze and build code from GitHub, GitLab, and public Git repositories. This integration allows developers to focus on writing code while App Platform handles the infrastructure management and deployment process.</p>
<p>We are excited to add Bitbucket Cloud to the list of our supported Git providers. Bitbucket is a widely recognized and used source code management tool for both large and small-scale projects, and this integration with Bitbucket Cloud now enables users to create an app and re-deploy it automatically when an update is made to the branch containing the source code.</p>

		<p>Today we’re excited to announce the launch of GitLab’s Open Source Security Hub — a central repository of security-focused projects developed by GitLab’s internal security team. These tools are designed to help developers, security practitioners, and organizations build safer, more secure software, and more resilient security programs.</p>
<p>Securing systems is an ongoing challenge for businesses as threat actors continually adapt to new technologies and find creative ways to exploit organizations. Not only are they evolving their tactics, techniques and procedures, but they’re also collaborating through criminal networks, sharing strategies, stolen data, and malicious tools to launch coordinated attacks at scale.</p>
