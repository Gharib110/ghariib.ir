<p>In a stark reminder of the growing threat posed by hacktivist groups, the pro-Palestinian Dark Storm Team has taken credit for a major distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on X (formerly Twitter). This attack underscores the vulnerability of even the most well-established digital platforms to sophisticated, politically motivated cyber threats. With online platforms playing an increasingly crucial role in global communication, the attack on X is part of a larger campaign of cyber aggression targeting critical infrastructure, government agencies, and major corporations. But who is the Dark Storm Team, and why should organizations worldwide take notice? Who is the Dark Storm […]</p>

		<p>This is a cryptography blog and I always feel the need to apologize for any post that isn’t “straight cryptography.” I’m actually getting a little tired of apologizing for it (though if you want some hard-core cryptography content, there’s plenty here and here.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to remind my colleagues that out in the real world, our job is not to solve exciting mathematical problems: <em>it’s to help people communicate securely</em>. And people, at this very moment, need a lot of help. Many of my friends are Federal employees or work for contractors, and they’re terrified that they’re going to lose their job based on speech they post online. Unfortunately, “online” to many people includes thoughts sent over private text messages — so even private conversations are becoming chilled. And while this is hardly the worst thing happening to people in this world, it’s something that’s happening to my friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>The promise of cloud native applications lies in their ability to provide enhanced agility, scalability, and resilience, perfectly aligning with the digital transformation needs of today&rsquo;s enterprises. However, as we navigate this transformation, cloud native application security is often surrounded by myths and misconceptions. Understanding these myths and how they are being addressed is crucial for organizations to secure their environments effectively.</p>
