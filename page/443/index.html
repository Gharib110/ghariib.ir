<p>Winter travel is filled with excitement—whether you’re heading to a snow-covered ski resort, visiting family for the holidays, or enjoying a cozy retreat in a picturesque town. According to Tripadvisor’s Winter Travel Index, 57% of Americans are gearing up for winter travel this year, with a staggering 96% planning to travel as much or more than they did last winter. Yet, with this seasonal joy comes a hidden danger: public Wi-Fi. Airports, hotels, coffee shops, and even ski lodges offer free Wi-Fi, making it easy to stay connected while on the go. But while these networks are convenient, they can also be risky.</p>

<p>Whether it tags along via a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or wearable, it seems like the internet follows us wherever we go nowadays. Yet there’s something else that follows us around as well — a growing body of personal info that we create while banking, shopping, and simply browsing the internet. And no doubt about it, our info is terrifically valuable.</p>
<p>What makes it so valuable? It’s no exaggeration to say that your personal info is the key to your digital life, along with your financial and civic life as well. Aside from using it to create accounts and logins, it’s further tied to everything from your bank accounts and credit cards to your driver’s license and your tax refund.</p>

<p>Two-step verification, two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication…whatever your social media platform calls it, it’s an excellent way to protect your accounts.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance you’re already using multi-factor verification with your other accounts — for your bank, your finances, your credit card, and any number of things. The way it requires an extra one-time code in addition to your login and password makes life far tougher for hackers.</p>
<p>It’s increasingly common to see nowadays, where all manner of online services only allow access to your accounts after you’ve provided a one-time passcode sent to your email or smartphone. That’s where two-step verification comes in. You get sent a code as part of your usual login process (usually a six-digit number), and then you enter that along with your username and password.</p>

These deceptive tactics are often used on popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and AliExpress. The goal of scammers is to artificially inflate product rankings and create fake reviews, ultimately boosting their sales and visibility. Read on to understand how brushing scams work and what steps you can take to stay safe.</p>
