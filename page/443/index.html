		<p>Zeus has been around for quite some time, we reported it about it initially back in 2009 when it was noted Zeus could evade anti-virus software. In more recent months it was noted that Zeus has become more focused and variations of Zeus were found to be targeting banks and financial organisations in specific geographic […]</p>

		<p>Oh look, another Facebook worm – this one seems pretty nasty and as usual it’s going for Facebook access details and then diving into banking credentials if it can find them. It’s mostly targeted at the UK though, worms of these type usually are geographically limited as they are targeting bank information – it’s better […]</p>

		<p>Since its inception in 2014, Giant Swarm has been 100% remote — not as an afterthought or a late-minute addendum but as part of its core (and I think very cool) founding philosophy. </p>
<p>An ever-evolving philosophy that challenges the status quo and invites us to do things better and differently, all while not taking itself too seriously. As our VP People Anna noted, <em>“Being remote is just a form of organization. You need human structures and psychological safety regardless.&quot;</em></p>

		<p>The Internet, a vast and intricate network of networks, relies on numerous underlying technologies and protocols to function seamlessly.</p>
<p>The concept of an autonomous system (AS) is one critical component that enables the Internet to operate efficiently.</p>
<p>In networking, an AS is a collection of IP prefixes under a single administrative domain that maintains a coherent routing policy.</p>
<p>This article delves into the intricacies of autonomous systems, exploring their structure, functionality, types, and the protocols that facilitate their operation.</p>

		<p>Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) firms face growing pressure to protect their investments from cyber threats. Whether it’s a high-profile data breach or tightening regulatory requirements like SOC2 compliance, the stakes are higher than ever. Yet, many portfolio companies—especially those in growth stages—often lack the internal expertise and resources to maintain a robust cybersecurity posture. This reality presents a significant risk, not only to the individual companies but also to the broader investment portfolio.</p>

		<p>2024 was an exciting year in technology, so Red Hat blog authors have delivered exciting news stories, musings and tutorials on all the latest trends and topics. Using a dump of traffic logs and the awk command, I’ve compiled a list of the top 10 articles we’ve published this year on the topic of artificial intelligence (AI).1. What is RHEL AI? A guide to the open source way for doing AIAI might be an impressive feat of engineering, but what can it actually do for your organization?

As another year transitions from present to past, I want1 to recap the notable new features, changes, updates and innovations Ubuntu saw over the past 12 months. And there was a fair bit: we got a noble new long-term support release in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, plus an opulent follow up in the form of Ubuntu 24.10, Canonical focused on ensuring Ubuntu stays the forefront of next-gen tech, and even snaps started to suck less! ;) For a round up of 10 cool things Ubuntu got, did, or committed to in 2024—listed in no particular order, lest anyone question my priorities— […]</p>
