		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>SoK: Trusted setups for powers-of-tau strings</strong><br>
<em>Faxing Wang, Shaanan Cohney, Joseph Bonneau</em></p>
<p>Many cryptographic protocols rely upon an initial emph{trusted setup} to generate public parameters. While the concept is decades old, trusted setups have gained prominence with the advent of blockchain applications utilizing zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), many of which rely on a ``powers-of-tau&rsquo;&rsquo; setup. Because such setups feature a dangerous trapdoor which undermines security if leaked, multiparty protocols are used to prevent the trapdoor from being known by any one party. Practical setups utilize an elaborate public ceremony to build confidence that the setup was not subverted. In this paper, we aim to systematize existing knowledge on trusted setups, drawing the distinction between setup emph{protocols} and emph{ceremonies}, and shed light on the different features of various approaches. We establish a taxonomy of protocols and evaluate real-world ceremonies based on their design principles, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Officially, the term “taser” refers to a particular brand of projectile-firing electric stun gun. However, the word is also colloquially used to refer to just about any device intended for delivering electric shocks to an adversary. The taser ring from [Penguin DIY] definitely fits that description, though we’d strictly advise you not to consider building this at home.</p>
<p>The build is a hacky one. An arc generator circuit was pulled out from a jet cigarette lighter, and reconfigured to fit in a small ring-based form factor. It was hooked up with a power switch and a small bank of 30 mAh lithium polymer cell for power, and a compact USB-C charger board was installed to keep the batteries juiced. The electronics were then delicately assembled into a ring-shaped mold, which was injected with resin to produce the final ring. Once cast, a pair of small metal electrodes were installed on the outside. Activating the taser function is as simple as squeezing the ring—easy to do just by making a fist.</p>

		<p>This September 23-25, at the 2025 Enterprise Tech Leadership Summit (ETLS) in Las Vegas, we will once again be exploring the impact of GenAI in our organizations. If you’re like me, you’ve experienced firsthand how generative GenAI reshapes our relationship with technology and how much we can benefit from it. Over the past year, I’ve been using it intensely in my daily work, and I’ve come to conclude that its impact will dwarf even the DevOps revolution that transformed our industry over the past decade.</p>
