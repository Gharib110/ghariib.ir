<p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) practices that aims to improve the efficiency, collaboration, and quality of software delivery. It is a cultural shift that focuses on breaking down silos between traditionally separate teams to improve the speed, reliability, and quality of software deployment. By integrating automation, monitoring, and collaboration, DevOps helps organizations deliver software faster, with fewer errors, and better alignment with customer needs.</p>

		<p>Data breaches continue to cost organizations millions of dollars each year, with costs rising steadily. According to IBM&rsquo;s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report, the average cost of a data breach has surged to $4.88 million globally, reflecting the increasing complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks. In the United States, this figure is even higher, averaging $9.8 million per breach, and the healthcare industry remains a prime target, with an average breach cost of $10 million—the highest of any sector. What Drives These Staggering Costs? Several factors contribute to these sky-high figures&hellip;</p>

<p>Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a security testing method designed to identify vulnerabilities in applications while running. Unlike static testing methods, which analyze code at rest, DAST interacts with live applications and mimics real-world attacks to uncover security flaws. This makes DAST particularly effective for detecting issues that only occur when an application is running.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to increase the collaboration between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. By unifying these traditionally separate groups, DevOps seeks to shorten the development lifecycle, enhance the quality of software, and ensure faster and more reliable releases. The core philosophy of DevOps revolves around automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and a culture of shared responsibility.</p>
<p>In this post, we will dive into <strong>what DevOps is</strong>, its essential features, and how its implementation leads to more efficient and collaborative software delivery processes.</p>

		<h2 id="zero-trust-security-model-definition"><strong>Zero Trust Security Model Definition</strong></h2>
<p>With the adoption of cloud computing, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT), the traditional network perimeter no longer exists. This has created challenges for security professionals, requiring a new approach to cybersecurity. Zero Trust has emerged as a transformative security model. Let’s take a closer look into what Zero Trust is, how it works, and the benefits it offers to modern enterprises.</p>
<h2 id="zero-trust-explained"><strong>Zero Trust Explained</strong></h2>
<p>Gone are the days when organizations could secure their assets with firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) alone. Workloads now live in the cloud, users and devices are increasingly mobile, and data flows across diverse locations and applications. This shift has widened visibility gaps and exposed vulnerabilities in legacy security approaches.</p>

	<div>
		<p>WhatsApp has accused the professional spyware company Paragon of spying on a select group of users.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, the Meta-owned, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform, said it has reliable information that nearly 100 journalists and other “members of civil society” were targets of a spyware campaign conducted by the Israeli spyware company.</p>
<p>“Members of civil society” usually refers to individuals and organizations that operate independently from government and business sectors, often those advocating for public interests, influencing policy, or holding governments accountable.</p>
