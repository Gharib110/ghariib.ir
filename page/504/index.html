	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Achieving and maintaining SOC2 Type 2 compliance is crucial for organizations handling sensitive data. This post explores the intersection of SOC2 Type 2 controls and the Cynefin framework, offering a unique perspective on navigating the complexities of compliance.</p>
<p>The Cynefin framework, developed by Dave Snowden, is a sense-making model that helps leaders determine the prevailing operative context so that they can make appropriate choices. It defines five domains: Clear (formerly known as Obvious), Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder. By mapping SOC2 Type 2 controls to these domains, we can better understand the nature of each control and the best approaches for implementation.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/sometimes-i-cache-implementing-lock-free-probabilistic-caching/">Sometimes I cache: implementing lock-free probabilistic caching</a></h1>
	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>HTTP caching is conceptually simple: if the response to a request is in the cache, serve it, and if not, pull it from your origin, put it in the cache, and return it. When the response is old, you repeat the process. If you are worried about too many requests going to your origin at once, you protect it with a cache lock: a small program, possibly distinct from your cache, that indicates if a request is already going to your origin. This is called cache revalidation.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>So far this Nayana payout is the biggest ransomware payment I’ve seen reported, there’s probably some bigger ones been paid but kept undercover. Certainly a good deal for the bad actors in this play, and well using an outdated Kernel along with PHP and Apache versions from 2006 you can’t feel too sorry for Nayana. […]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>We are organizers of Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan. Our team is composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair.</p>
<p>Our goal is to increase the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly.</p>
