<p>Johnston Retail Services has partnered with Privately SA to bring the AgeAI app to Ireland, helping to prevent vape sales to minors and avoid the risk of costly fines</p>
<p>20 November 2024 – Stores across Ireland can now benefit from a pioneering AI solution that can estimate someone’s age with almost 100% accuracy, thanks to a new partnership between Dublin’s Johnston Retail Services and SafetyTech company Privately SA.</p>
<p>Privately’s AgeAI app provides automated and highly accurate facial age estimation, removing the guesswork from age checks and mitigating the risk of fines for selling vapes to children. It is 100% anonymous, with no images transmitted or stored, GDPR certified, and helps protect staff by reducing the need for unnecessary ID checks for adults who are a source of major conflict.</p>
