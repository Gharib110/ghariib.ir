<h2 id="plain-english-explanation">Plain English Explanation</h2>
<p>Machine learning systems today are like students who can only answer questions they&rsquo;ve seen before. When faced with completely new situations, they often fail spectacularly. This contrasts sharply with biological evolution, which has produced organisms that can handle novel cha&hellip;</p>

		<p>With a new drag-and-drop feature, Microsoft wants to make sharing files hassle-free for Windows 11 users.</p>
<p>When Windows 11 debuted back in 2021, people had mixed feelings about it, because while the design was refreshing, useful features like the drag-and-drop items on the taskbar were missing, leading to outrage. The taskbar drag-and-drop and other missing features were reintroduced to Windows 11 in the 22H2 update. Now, after more than two years, the software giant is once again rolling up its sleeves to take the drag-and-drop to the next level to make sharing effortless.</p>

		<p>Going direct and getting genuine parts for your favorite consoles should be a thing.</p>
<p>Has the fan seized up inside your game console? How about the display or disc drive? Whenever something goes wrong with a specific part of any video game console, it can be a pain to get it rectified. The most common route is to reach out to the manufacturer, which will require you to either send out the device or seek local assistance from a nearby shop. This can prove time-consuming and costly, depending on whether your console is still under warranty. But what about a classic console? Why don&rsquo;t manufacturers stock and sell parts for all console models?</p>

		<p>Put your gaming and tinkering skills to the test with these fun Raspberry Pi projects</p>
<p>Over the years, the Raspberry Pi SBCs have brought numerous types of projects to life. For coders, you’ve got LAMP web servers, Flask websites, and portable Kali Linux workstations. Meanwhile, home lab enthusiasts can use these tiny boards to build a reliable Docker ecosystem that includes everything from the containers to management/orchestration platforms like Portainer and Kubernetes. Then there are the more practical projects like media servers, NAS, VPN machines, and Home Assistant hubs.</p>

		<p>Make your laptop even better with the right mix of peripherals.</p>
<p>Many of us rely on our laptops for work, school, or entertainment, but even the best laptops trade power and features for the convenience of portability. Gaming laptops come with power-limited GPUs, pretty much all laptops are limited in storage space, and the thinner they get, the harder they are to cool. But with a few wisely chosen pieces of external hardware, that laptop can turn into a powerhouse of productivity and graphical prowess.</p>
