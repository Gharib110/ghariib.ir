		<p>In a disturbing number of incidents in recent years, local governments have withheld critical services, resulting in destruction and death. Consider, for example, the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, 2022.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officers waited for 77 minutes inside Robb Elementary School before confronting and killing the active shooter who murdered 21 people—19 children and two teachers—and trapped 36 people in a room, many of whom were shot and dying. In the final incident review by the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Merrick Garland called the law enforcement response “a failure,” but “criminal” is likely more accurate. Two of the responding officers will go on trial in Texas in October 2025.</p>

		<p>Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, agile, and fast. For managed service providers (MSPs) supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with cybersecurity services, staying ahead of these adversaries is crucial. One of the most effective ways to do so is through round-the-clock threat hunting.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll explore why constant threat hunting is essential, the challenges MSPs face in providing it, and how OpenText MDR can help overcome these challenges while offering SMBs the protection they need.</p>

		<p>The idea of artificial intelligence (AI) is not new, but recent advancements in related technologies have turned it from something more hypothetical-than-real to a tool that many of us use every day. The growing importance and proliferation of AI is at once exciting and potentially alarming as the foundations of many AI tools are essentially black boxes owned and controlled by a small number of powerful corporations.At Red Hat we believe that everyone should have the ability to contribute to AI. AI innovation shouldn&rsquo;t be restricted to companies that can afford massive amounts of processing po</p>

		<p><em>Am I Racist?</em>, Matt Walsh’s searing attack on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, dominated the documentary film box office in 2024. Screening in 1,600 theaters at its height, the film earned $12.3 million before streaming on the Daily Wire. Walsh’s film grossed more at the box office than any other documentary since 2019. That’s when Peter Jackson’s artistically boundary-pushing World War I film <em>They Shall Not Grow Old</em> brought in $12.2 million. </p>

		<p>Containers are an important part of modern computing, for hosting, for application development, and even as an alternative to virtualization. The infrastructure supporting containers has been refined and developed since the early days, so if you&rsquo;ve been holding off on adopting containers, you might be pleasantly surprised at how easy the daemonless Podman engine makes it to build, run, and manage containers and pods.Containers interface directly with Linux kernel abilities like cgroups and namespaces. Running a container literally uses your existing kernel to run additional Linux systems insid</p>

		<p>Companies are showing customers different prices for the same goods and services based what data they have on them, including details like their precise location or browser history.</p>
<p>The name for this method is surveillance pricing, and the FTC has just released initial findings of a report looking into that practice. In July 2024, the FTC requested information from eight companies offering surveillance pricing products and services that incorporate data about consumers’ characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h3 id="31-affected-products">3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS</h3>
<p>The following versions of RSSPlus are affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSSPlus 2M: build dates 01/08 through at least 01/23</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="321-authentication-bypass-by-primary-weakness-cwe-305"><strong>3.2.1</strong> <strong>AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY PRIMARY WEAKNESS CWE-305</strong></h4>
<p>The affected product is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability targeting deterministic RSSPlus SecurityAccess service seeds, which may allow an attacker to remotely (proximal/adjacent with RF equipment or via pivot from J2497 telematics devices) call diagnostic functions intended for workshop or repair scenarios. This can impact system availability, potentially degrading performance or erasing software, however the vehicle remains in a safe vehicle state.</p>
