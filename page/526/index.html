<p><strong>Update:</strong> This feature is now available in production.</p>
<p>The latest beta release of Signal Desktop includes preliminary support for one-to-one voice and video calls. Call your friends and family on macOS, Windows, and Linux; see their smiles on a larger screen; hear their laughter through the big speakers on your desk; and help us test the next generation of calling on Signal.</p>

<p>The number of people who join Signal every day is still growing at a record pace. With so many new conversations getting started, we’ve heard from a lot of users that they’d like more control over how they begin.</p>
<p>With message requests, when someone who isn’t in your contacts starts a new chat with you or adds you to a group, you can quickly see more info before accepting the request, deleting it, or blocking the conversation.</p>

<p>We reply with a short explanation that lays out why there’s nothing wrong, but we understand the confusion. Nobody would be excited about getting a grade like this on a homework assignment – and you’d have to stay after class and ask the teacher what the hell a “T” even means on your report about summer vacation (“T”oo cool for school?).</p>

<p>We continue to be inspired by the energy and enthusiasm that is helping to shape change in America, and many people have reached out and asked how they can help. In order to make it as easy as possible, we’re opening up a separate donation space to continue funding these efforts.</p>

<p>The world was a different place when we <a href="https://signal.org/blog/reactions/">announced message reactions</a> back in February, but expressing the way you feel has never been more important. Instead of being limited to the default set of reactions that we started with, the latest Signal updates for Android, Desktop, and iOS let you react with even more emoji.</p>

<p>Signal iOS now includes a new feature that makes it possible to switch to a brand-new iPhone or iPad while securely transferring Signal information from your existing iOS device. As with every new Signal feature, the process is end-to-end encrypted and <a href="/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/">designed to protect your privacy</a>. Transfers also occur over a local connection (similar to AirDrop), so even large migrations can be completed quickly.</p>

Online, we’re working to scale and <a href="/blog/blur-tools/">improve Signal</a> for everyone that is relying on it, but as one small offline way to help support everyone self-organizing for change in the streets, we’re also distributing face coverings free of charge.</p>

<p>Right now, people around the world are marching and protesting against racism and police brutality, outraged by the most recent police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At Signal, we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we don’t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out.</p>
