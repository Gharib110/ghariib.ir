		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce a successful completion of the Health Data Hosting (Hébergeur de Données de Santé, HDS) certification audit, and renewal of the HDS certification for 24 AWS Regions.</p>
<p>The Agence du Numérique en Santé (ANS), the French governmental agency for health, introduced the HDS certification to strengthen the security and protection of personal health data. By achieving this certification, AWS demonstrates our continuous commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for cloud service providers.</p>

		<p>AWS re:Invent 2024 was held in Las Vegas December 2–6, with over 54,000 attendees participating in more than 2,300 sessions and hands-on labs. The conference was a hub of innovation and learning hosted by AWS for the global cloud computing community.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we cover on-demand sessions and major security, identity, and compliance announcements that were unveiled leading up to and during the conference. Whether you missed the event or want to revisit the key takeaways, we’ve compiled the essential information for you to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in AWS security, identity, and compliance. This year’s event put best practices for zero trust, generative AI–driven security, identity, and access management, DevSecOps, network and infrastructure security, data protection, and threat detection and incident response at the forefront.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Black-Box Registered ABE from Lattices</strong><br>
<em>Ziqi Zhu, Kai Zhang, Zhili Chen, Junqing Gong, Haifeng Qian</em></p>
<p>This paper presents the first black-box registered ABE for circuit from lattices. The selective security is based on evasive LWE assumption [EUROCRYPT'22, CRYPTO'22]. The unique prior Reg-ABE scheme from lattices is derived from non-black-box construction based on function-binding hash and witness encryption [CRYPTO'23]. Technically, we first extend the black-box registration-based encryption from standard LWE [CRYPTO'23] so that we can register a public key with a function; this yields a LWE-based Reg-ABE with ciphertexts of size $L cdot mathsf{polylog}(L)$ where $L$ is the number of users. We then make use of the special structure of its ciphertext to reduce its size to $mathsf{polylog}(L)$ via an algebraic obfuscator based on evasive LWE [CRYPTO'24].</p>

		<p>As a rule, book reviews are not a thing I usually do.</p>
<p>So when I received an out-of-the-blue email from Cory Doctorow last week asking if I would review his latest book, Red Team Blues, it took a minute to overcome my initial skepticism. While I’m a fan of Cory’s work, this is a narrow/nerdy blog about cryptography, not a place where we spend much time on literature. Moreover, my only previous attempt to review a popular cryptography novel — a quick sketch of Dan Brown’s abysmal <em>Digital Fortress</em> — did not go very well for anyone.</p>

		<p>The next BSides København will take place on 9 November 2024. There is one presentation in the schedule about the use of metrics in information security. Computers allow us to create documents, charts, and statistical values easily from any data collection we like. Therefore, the World Wide Web is full of graphs, tables with numbers, predictions, and all kinds of results. The problem is that not everything you can count is a suitable metric tied to real-life observations. Finding a metric is a science on its own. This presentation will give you some examples of how to measure meaningful attributes of computer systems and networks. You will also get to know the term metric more closely. Using proper metrics and assessing customer-provided reports will help you immensely when dealing with information security decisions. The</p>

<p>Upon loading the screen, we are presented with a file upload and a button to make a jpeg icon. We also note that the version string indicates it was made in 2016, with a version of <code>Version 2016.3717</code>. After playing around with it for a little while, I thought about how there was that ImageMagick bug last year that let you execute code remotely. I wasn’t sure it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>
