<p>A new mass malware campaign is infecting users with a cryptocurrency miner named <strong>SilentCryptoMiner</strong> by masquerading it as a tool designed to circumvent internet blocks and restrictions around online services.</p>
<p>Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said the activity is part of a larger trend where cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging Windows Packet Divert (WPD) tools to distribute malware under the guise of restriction bypass programs.</p>
<p>“Such software is often distributed in the form of archives with text installation instructions, in which the developers recommend disabling security solutions, citing false positives,” researchers Leonid Bezvershenko, Dmitry Pikush, and Oleg Kupreev said. “This plays into the hands of attackers by allowing them to persist in an unprotected system without the risk of detection.”</p>

<p>Aqua Nautilus researchers have discovered a new attack campaign targeting interactive computing environments such as <code>Jupyter</code> <code>Notebooks</code>. The attack consists of multiple stages, beginning with the download of a compressed file from a remote server. Once executed, the attacker deploys several malicious tools to exploit the server and establish persistence. This campaign poses a significant risk to cloud-native environments, as it enables unauthorized access and long-term control over compromised systems.</p>

</p>
<p>On March 14th, 2025, security researchers discovered a critical software supply chain vulnerability in the widely-used GitHub Action <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code> (CVE-2025-30066). This vulnerability allows remote attackers to expose CI/CD secrets via the action&rsquo;s build logs. The issue affects users who rely on the <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code> action in GitHub workflows to track changed files within a pull request.</p>
<p>Due to the compromised action, sensitive CI/CD secrets are being inadvertently logged in the GitHub Actions build logs. If these logs are publicly accessible, such as in public repositories, unauthorized users could access and retrieve the clear text secrets. However, there is no evidence suggesting that the exposed secrets were transmitted to any external network.</p>

		<p>Back in May 2019, along with my colleagues Heather Mahalik and Adrian Leong, we wrote the paper &ldquo;<strong>Using Apple “Bug Reporting” for forensic purposes</strong>&rdquo; and some scripts to parse data stored in Sysdiagnose logs.</p>
<p>The paper is still available for download and, for the most part, is still accurate. But time goes on, and new iOS versions have come on the market in recent years. I took a first look at a sysdiagnose generated on a freshly wiped iPhone with iOS 16 natively installed.</p>

		<p>President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge after Jocelyn Nungaray, a Houston girl whose tragic murder at the hands of two unauthorized Venezuelan immigrants, captured national attention. The decision, while framed as an honor to the young victim, raised eyebrows. It marked yet another instance in which Trump leveraged symbolic renaming as a political tool. Previously, in a move that defied geography, diplomacy, and common sense, President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming a section of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” </p>

<p>In Apr. 2019, Kristi Noem, Governor of South Dakota at the time, and now U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), wrote that “the cost of cyberattacks is climbing, and the vulnerability of businesses to attacks is on the rise,” and that “by 2021, there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs around the world, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.”</p>
