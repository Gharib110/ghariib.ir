	<div>
		<p>When you’re secure—innovation happens. But, the fast pace of AI often outpaces traditional security measures, leaving gaps that bad actors can take advantage of. As a security professional, you’re the hero in this battle between protecting vast amounts of data while ensuring AI systems remain transparent and compliant. What you need in this time of new threats and complexity in securing interconnected AI applications is a proactive, innovative approach to stay ahead. </p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Amazon has announced its Echo devices will no longer have the option to store and process requests on the device itself, meaning your voice recordings will now be sent to the cloud for processing.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers, Amazon explained that the feature “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” will no longer be available beginning March 28, 2025.</p>
<p>The reason for this change? AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As we continue to expand Alexa’s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.”</p>

<p>Not to be confused with the titular Linux mascot and seabird cousin, the penguin, puffins are another distinctively colorful and whimsical nautical avian. Over the centuries, these beaky birds have been given numerous nicknames and monikers like the “sea parrot” and the harlequinesque appearance of their facial feathers has earned them the distinction of “Clown of the Sea”. </p>
<p>The <em>Fratercula</em> family, to which puffins belong, has Latin roots that pay homage to its namesake’s connection to the clergy. It’s said that the bird’s striking black-and-white plumage was reminiscent of the formal attire worn by friars and monks, lending an air of reverence to this charismatic fowl.</p>

	<div>
		<p>We were alerted to Mac and Windows stealers currently distributed via Reddit posts targeting users engaging in cryptocurrency trading. One of the common lures is a cracked software version of the popular trading platform TradingView.</p>
<p>The crooks are posting links to both Windows and Mac installers which have been laced with Lumma Stealer and Atomic Stealer (AMOS) respectively.</p>
<p>These two malware families have wreaked havoc, pillaging victims’ personal data and enabling their distributors to make substantial gains, mostly by taking over cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

		<p>Generative AI is reshaping many aspects of our lives, from how we work and learn, to how we play and interact. Given that it&rsquo;s Security Week, it&rsquo;s a good time to think about some of the unintended consequences of this information revolution and the role that we play in bringing them about.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s web is full of AI-generated content: text, code, images, audio, and video can all be generated by machines, normally based on a prompt from a human. Some models have become so sophisticated that distinguishing their artifacts — that is, the text, audio, and video they generate — from everything else can be quite difficult, even for machines themselves. This difficulty creates a number of challenges. On the one hand, those who train and deploy generative AI need to be able to identify AI-created artifacts they scrape from websites in order to avoid polluting their training data. On the other hand, the origin of these artifacts may be intentionally misrepresented, creating myriad problems for society writ large.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>During the forensic examination of a smartphone, we sometimes need to understand some basic settings of the device. Some simple examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of the device?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time zone automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data switched on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data roaming switched on or off?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Android devices, most of these settings are managed centrally by the Android settings provider. </p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Removing 24 malicious apps from the Google Play store and silencing some servers almost halved a botnet known as BadBox.</p>
<p>The BadBox botnet focuses on Android devices, but not just phones. It also affects other devices like TV streaming boxes, tablets, and smart TVs.</p>
<p>The German BSI (Federal Office for Information Security) started the disruption campaign in December by blocking the malware on 30,000 devices. BadBox is referred to as a botnet, because one of its capabilities is to set up the affected device to act as a proxy, allowing other people to use the device’s internet bandwidth and hardware to route their own traffic.</p>

		<p>Google is spying on Android users, starting from even before they have logged in to their Google account.</p>
<p>That’s what researchers from Dublin’s Trinity College found after they conducted a measurement study to investigate the cookies, identifiers and other data stored on Android devices by Google Play Services.</p>
<p>As the company behind the Android Operating System (OS), the Google Play Store, the most popular search engine in the world, and part of the leading company in digital advertising (Alphabet), Google has obtained a position where it would be hard not to profit from.</p>
