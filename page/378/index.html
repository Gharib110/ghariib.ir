		<p>Quantum computing was long considered to be part of a distant future. However, it is quickly becoming a reality. Google’s recent announcement of its Willow quantum computing chip is a breakthrough generating significant media attention and questions about the implications for cybersecurity. Google’s Willow advancements are significant because of two major breakthroughs critical to the […]</p>

		<p>Numerous blogs and articles are urging security professionals to start migrating to quantum-resistant algorithms immediately. This urgency was heightened on August 13, 2024, when NIST finalized the FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) standards. In this article, I present a simplified example of a client establishing a TLS 1.3 connection to […]</p>

		<p>Here are some dedicated tips for keeping younger children safe online. One of these training tips goes into the risks of young children on the Internet, covers cyber bullying and other risky Internet behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the suggestions parents should take into account regarding kids online.</strong></p>
<p>• Talk with your kids about online safety and the dangers of communicating with strangers.</p>
<p>• Put the computer your children use in a public part of your house so you can supervise their Internet access. Act immediately if they seem to be hiding something from you.</p>

<p>Released in 1993, Intel’s Pentium processor was a marvel of technological progress. Its floating point unit (FPU) was a big improvement over its predecessors that still used the venerable CORDIC algorithm. In a recent blog post [Ken Shirriff] takes an up-close look at the FPU and associated ROMs in the Pentium die that enable its use of polynomials. Even with 3.1 million transistors, the Pentium die is still on a large enough process node that it can be readily analyzed with an optical microscope.</p>

		<p>The School of Engineering welcomes 15 new faculty members across six of its academic departments. This new cohort of faculty members, who have either recently started their roles at MIT or will start within the next year, conduct research across a diverse range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Many of these new faculty specialize in research that intersects with multiple fields. In addition to positions in the School of Engineering, a number of these faculty have positions at other units across MIT. Faculty with appointments in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) report into both the School of Engineering and the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing. This year, new faculty also have joint appointments between the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the School of Science.</p>

<p>Germanium. It might sound like just another periodic table entry (number 32, to be exact), but in the world of infrared light, it’s anything but ordinary. A recent video by [The Action Lab] dives into the fascinating property of germanium being transparent to infrared light. This might sound like sci-fi jargon, but it’s a real phenomenon that can be easily demonstrated with nothing more than a flashlight and a germanium coin. If you want to see how that looks, watch the video on how it’s done.</p>

		<p>Excellent read. One example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the case of basic public key cryptography, in which a person’s public and private key are created together in a single operation. These two keys are entangled, not with quantum physics, but with math.</p>
<p>When I create a virtual machine server in the Amazon cloud, I am prompted for an RSA public key that will be used to control access to the machine. Typically, I create the public and private keypair on my laptop and upload the public key to Amazon, which bakes my public key into the server’s administrator account. My laptop and that remove server are thus entangled, in that the only way to log into the server is using the key on my laptop. And because that administrator account can do anything to that server­—read the sensitivity data, hack the web server to install malware on people who visit its web pages, or anything else I might care to do­—the private key on my laptop represents a security risk for that server&hellip;</p>
