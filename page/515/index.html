<p>With 2023 coming to an end and before the holiday season starts, we thought today would be a good time to <a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release</a> <strong>Kali 2023.4</strong>. Whilst this release may not have the most end-user features in it again, there are a number of new platform offerings and there has still been a lot of changes going on behind-the-scenes for us, which has a positive knock-on effect resulting in a benefit for everyone. News, platforms, and features aside, it would not be a Kali release if there was not a number of changes to our packages - both new tools and upgrades to existing ones. If you want to see what is new for yourself <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download</a> a new image or <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">upgrade <em>if you already have a Kali Linux installation</em></a>.</p>

<p>Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and our cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work to add a layer of <a href="/blog/pqxdh/">quantum resistance</a> to the Signal Protocol, and our previous work on <a href="/blog/sealed-sender/">metadata protection technologies</a> that help keep personal details like your <a href="/blog/building-faster-oram/">contact list</a>, <a href="/blog/signal-private-group-system/">group membership</a>, <a href="/blog/signal-profiles-beta/">profile name</a>, and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our thinking and <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">making our code open source</a> and open to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.</p>
