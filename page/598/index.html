	<div>
		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-21610<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 45 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Trix is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get rich text editor for everyday writing. Versions prior to 2.1.12 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when pasting malicious code in the link field. An attacker could trick the user to copy&amp;paste a malicious `javascript:` URL as a link that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user&rsquo;s session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed. Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.12 or later to receive a patch. In addition to upgrading, affected users can disallow browsers that don&rsquo;t support a Content Security Policy (CSP) as a workaround for this and other cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Set CSP policies such as script-src &lsquo;self&rsquo; to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.<br>

		<p>As we look ahead to 2025, businesses across Asia Pacific (APAC) are expected to accelerate their adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity, using it as a critical tool to combat evolving AI-powered threats.</p>
<p>With 43% of security professionals predicting that these sophisticated threats will increasingly evade traditional detection methods, organizations are poised to leverage AI-driven strategies to proactively mitigate risks. At the same time, there is a growing push to secure AI systems themselves, evidenced by initiatives like Singapore’s recent AI security guidelines – trends that are likely to shape cybersecurity practices across the region in the coming year.</p>
