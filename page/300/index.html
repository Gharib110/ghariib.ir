<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 18, 2024</p>
<p>Global cybercrime costs are rising rapidly, with estimates reaching $10.5 trillion by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. These financial hits stem from issues like damaged or stolen data, productivity losses, business disruptions, fraud, and the costly aftermath of recovery. The good news? Investing in the right cybersecurity solutions can empower your organization to defend against and recover from cybercrime and other IT-related incidents prevalent in our evolving digital landscape.</p>

<p>If you’ve owned a CD player or other piece of consumer digital audio gear manufactured since the 1980s, the chances are it has a TOSLINK port on the back. This is a fairly simple interface that sends I2S digital audio data down a short length of optical fibre, and it’s designed to run between something like a CD player and an external DAC. It’s ancient technology in optical fibre terms, with a lowish data rate and plastic fibre, but consider for a minute whether it could be adapted for modern ultra-high-speed conenctions. It’s what [Ben Cartwright-Cox] has done, and he delivered a talk about it at the recent 38C3 event in Germany.</p>

		<p>2FA over SMS isn&rsquo;t just unreliable, it&rsquo;s also a security risk.</p>
<p>MFA, or Multi-Factor Authentication, has proliferated throughout our computing lives over the last decade. It largely began with SMS-based authentication in addition to a password, allowing users to add an extra layer of authentication by forcing users to enter a code sent to their phone upon an attempted login. The truth is, SMS-based authentication was never secure. Due to the inherent technology and the infrastructure around SIM cards, 2FA with SMS is not only inadequate; it also actively compromises your security, and here are 4 reasons why you should use a dedicated 2FA app instead.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It might not have all of the features, but it&rsquo;s easy to use and looks good.</p>
<p>When it comes to tools you should use on your PC, Task Manager is one of the more useful tools for power users on Windows 11. It&rsquo;s quite common to use it for basic functionality like ending processes that refuse to close, but aside from that, there is a lot more it can do, too. If you want even more functionality, though, then you should try out an alternative like Task Manager DeLuxe.</p>

		<p>Buying a new mouse? Here are a few things you should be on the lookout for to make sure you get the right one</p>
<p>Upgrading any part of your computer setup is always a fun time. Even if you&rsquo;re not a gamer, getting that little bit of extra comfort or quality can go a long way toward making your experience better. It could make it easier to win games, but it could also help you get work done faster, and that&rsquo;s no different with computer mice.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Will these add-ons make you switch to Sheets from Excel?</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel is undoubtedly one of the most powerful apps out there to work with numbers. However, it requires an Office 365 subscription or an Office 2024 purchase, which isn&rsquo;t feasible for a lot of users. If you don&rsquo;t want to shell out money, a good alternative to Excel is Google Sheets. Not only is it free to use, but it is also a simpler version for students with less intimidating features and options. Moreover, you also get a plethora of templates and features like extensions for added functionality.</p>
