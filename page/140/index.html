<p>Did you ever hear of a satellite called Parcae (pronounced like park-eye)? If you haven’t, don’t feel bad—it was, after all, a top-secret project only revealed in July 2023. [Ivan Amato] not only heard about it, but also wrote a fascinating peek into the cloak-and-dagger world of cold-war spy satellites for this month’s IEEE Spectrum.</p>
<p>According to [Ivan], the satellite helped the United States to keep track of Russian submarines and was arguably the most capable orbiting spy platform ever. Or, at least, that we get to hear about.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Path Privacy and Handovers: Preventing Insider Traceability Attacks During Secure Handovers</strong><br>
<em>Rabiah Alnashwan, Benjamin Dowling, Bhagya Wimalasiri</em></p>
<p>The rise of 5G and IoT has shifted secure communication from centralized and homogeneous to a landscape of heterogeneous mobile devices constantly travelling between myriad networks. In such environments, it is desirable for devices to securely extend their connection from one network to another, often referred to as a handover. In this work we introduce the first cryptographic formalisation of secure handover schemes. We leverage our formalisation to propose path privacy, a novel security property for handovers that has hitherto remained unexplored. We further develop a syntax for secure handovers, and identify security properties appropriate for secure handover schemes. Finally, we introduce a generic handover scheme that captures all the strong notions of security we have identified, combining our novel path privacy concept with other security properties characteristic to existing handover schemes, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our framework.</p>

A new beta release of open source graphics editing app Pinta is available for testing. Pinta 3.0 (beta) gives fans of this cross-platform raster image editor, which is directly inspired by the iconic Paint.NET Windows app, an early opportunity to try out the changes it brings — and there’s a fair few! The most impactful change in Pinta 3.0 is the most obvious one: it’s revamped UI. Newly ported to GTK4 and libadwaita, Pinta 3.0 swaps a traditional window frame and text-based menu bar for a button-based header bar. Long-time users may might themselves taking a bit of time to […]</p>

<p>Remember Plank, the simplest dock on the planet? There’s now a free open-source fork to make it fully functional in recent Linux Distributions.</p>
<p>Plank is a 14 years old application that provides an iOS bottom bar style dock app launcher, that’s great for lightweight Linux Desktops. The goal is to provide just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more.</p>
<p>Plank seems not in active development, though it still works in recent Linux Distributions. However, it has compatibility issues and broken docklets/applets. For those who’re still using or prefer this dock, there’s now an open-source fork worth a try.</p>

		<p>PowerSchool, a leading U.S.-based education technology provider, has begun notifying students, teachers, and other affected individuals following a massive data breach that occurred in December 2024.</p>
<p>The breach, which compromised sensitive personal information, is one of the largest cybersecurity incidents to impact the education sector in recent years.</p>
<p>The breach occurred when attackers gained unauthorized access to PowerSchool’s customer support portal using stolen credentials.</p>
<p>This allowed them to extract data from the company’s Student Information System (SIS), which is widely used across North America to manage student records, grades, and attendance.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Preprocessing Security in Multiple Idealized Models with Applications to Schnorr Signatures and PSEC-KEM</strong><br>
<em>Jeremiah Blocki, Seunghoon Lee</em></p>
<p>In modern cryptography, relatively few instantiations of foundational cryptographic primitives are used across most cryptographic protocols. For example, elliptic curve groups are typically instantiated using P-256, P-384, Curve25519, or Curve448, while block ciphers are commonly instantiated with AES, and hash functions with SHA-2, SHA-3, or SHAKE. This limited diversity raises concerns that an adversary with nation-state-level resources could perform a preprocessing attack, generating a hint that might later be exploited to break protocols built on these primitives. It is often notoriously challenging to analyze and upper bound the advantage of a preprocessing attacker even if we assume that we have idealized instantiations of our cryptographic primitives (ideal permutations, ideal ciphers, random oracles, generic groups). Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18) demonstrated a powerful framework to simplify the analysis of preprocessing attacks, but they only proved that their framework applies when the cryptographic protocol uses a single idealized primitive. In practice, however, cryptographic constructions often utilize multiple different cryptographic primitives.</p>

<em>Andrea Basso, Giacomo Borin, Wouter Castryck, Maria Corte-Real Santos, Riccardo Invernizzi, Antonin Leroux, Luciano Maino, Frederik Vercauteren, Benjamin Wesolowski</em></p>
<p>The problem of computing an isogeny of large prime degree from a supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring is assumed to be hard both for classical as well as quantum computers. In this work, we first build a two-round identification protocol whose security reduces to this problem. The challenge consists of a random large prime $q$ and the prover simply replies with an efficient representation of an isogeny of degree $q$ from its public key. Using the hash-and-sign paradigm, we then derive a signature scheme with a very simple and flexible signing procedure and prove its security in the standard model. Our optimized C implementation of the signature scheme shows that signing is roughly $1.8times$ faster than all SQIsign variants, whereas verification is $1.4times$ times slower. The sizes of the public key and signature are comparable to existing schemes.</p>
