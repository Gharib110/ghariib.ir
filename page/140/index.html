		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a driving force in technological innovation, transforming industries and reshaping how we interact with technology. Open and public AI, which emphasizes sharing models, datasets and methodologies, is at the heart of this evolution. Aligning with open source principles and fostering collaboration democratizes access to AI and helps accelerate advancements. This openness introduces complex ethical challenges, however, especially when it comes to balancing transparency with safety.This article examines the ethical considerations surrounding open and public AI, and</p>

<p>Johnston Retail Services has partnered with Privately SA to bring the AgeAI app to Ireland, helping to prevent vape sales to minors and avoid the risk of costly fines</p>
<p>20 November 2024 – Stores across Ireland can now benefit from a pioneering AI solution that can estimate someone’s age with almost 100% accuracy, thanks to a new partnership between Dublin’s Johnston Retail Services and SafetyTech company Privately SA.</p>
<p>Privately’s AgeAI app provides automated and highly accurate facial age estimation, removing the guesswork from age checks and mitigating the risk of fines for selling vapes to children. It is 100% anonymous, with no images transmitted or stored, GDPR certified, and helps protect staff by reducing the need for unnecessary ID checks for adults who are a source of major conflict.</p>

<p>Could we create warp drive someday? In this Star Trek-themed episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice team up with astrophysicist Charles Liu to dive into the science, technology, and legacy of one of the most influential sci-fi franchises of all time: Star Trek.</p>
<p>We answer questions about quantum entanglement, the size of electrons, and the real science behind Trek tech or Treknology. How close are we to warp drives, transporters, and subspace communication? You might be surprised to hear what’s theoretically possible and what remains in the realm of science fiction.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 28, 2025</p>
<p>In our hyper-connected world, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. With increasing reliance on digital technologies, individuals and organizations face a growing array of cyber threats, ranging from data breaches to ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>Cybercrime is projected to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.</p>

<p>It’s Data Privacy Week right now, and that means, for the most part, that you’re going to see a lot of well-intentioned but clumsy information online about how to protect your data privacy. You’ll see articles about iPhone settings. You’ll hear acronyms for varying state laws. And you’ll probably see ads for a variety of apps, plug-ins, and online tools that can be difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>Deepfakes are no longer just the stuff of sci-fi thrillers—they’re here, and they’re deceptively good. From celebrity endorsements to real-time impersonations, deepfake technology has advanced to the point where spotting one isn’t as easy as it used to be.</p>

<em>Minghang Li, Qianhong Wu, Zhipeng Wang, Bo Qin, Bohang Wei, Hang Ruan, Shihong Xiong, Zhenyang Ding</em></p>
<p>BFT protocols usually have a waterfall-like degradation in performance in the face of crash faults. Some BFT protocols may not experience sudden performance degradation under crash faults. They achieve this at the expense of increased communication and round complexity in fault-free scenarios. In a nutshell, existing protocols lack the adaptability needed to perform optimally under varying conditions.</p>
