		<p>The Turkish government is proposing a controversial new cybersecurity law that could make it a criminal act to report on data breaches. The new legislation proposes penalties for various cybersecurity-related offences. But they key one which has people concerned is this: &ldquo;Those who carry out activities aimed at targeting institutions or individuals by creating the perception that there has been a data breach in cyberspace, even though there has been no data breach, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two to five years.&rdquo; The problem is, of course, that such a law may discourage the&hellip;</p>

<p>So, you’ve heard about open source. You know it’s a great way to learn new skills, build up your resume, and give back to the developer community—but maybe you’re not sure where to begin.</p>
<p>Getting involved in open source can raise all sorts of questions: Are there specific contribution guidelines? Or a certain level of involvement required before tackling issues? Don’t worry, we’ve got your back.</p>
