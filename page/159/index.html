<p>Handhelds are designed to be portable, but what if you need something smaller than OEM? The Steam Brick pulls basically everything off of a Steam Deck to make it as portable as possible.</p>
<p>[crastinator-pro] found they rarely used the controller or screen on their Steam Deck, and the form factor was too bulky to conveniently chuck into their bag, negating the advantage of owning a portable console. As to be expected from any self-respecting hacker, they did a couple quick tests with components unplugged then got to work with the rotary tool.</p>

<p>As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems become more prevalent, their ability to make decisions that impact our lives ‚Äî ranging from healthcare diagnoses to loan approvals ‚Äî has grown exponentially. However, the complexity of these systems often makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust, ethical concerns, and regulatory challenges. Testing for explainability in AI/ML is a critical practice that ensures these systems provide clear, understandable, and interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. By prioritizing explainability, organizations can build trust, ensure compliance, and create AI/ML systems that are both powerful and accountable.</p>

		<p>The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is decentralized blockchain technology, it is secure and transparent which provides an alternative to centralized internet cloud providers.</p>
<p>ICP maintains an independent data center that aims to bring efficient data, speed, and decentralization to computation and data storage. Internet Computer protocol uses ICP as its native cryptocurrency which is used to pay transaction fees, rewards, incentives, and other transactions. Users can build their DApps on ICP, which allows developers to write their smart contracts in different popular languages like Rust, TypeScript, or Python. The smart contract is regarded as canisters which are hosted on an ICP blockchain network called subnet.</p>

</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are leveraging artificial intelligence to launch phishing attacks that are more sophisticated, convincing, and dangerous than ever before. These AI-generated scams go beyond traditional techniques, creating highly personalized messages that mimic the tone, style, and context of real-world communications. Executives, in particular, are prime targets for these attacks, as they hold the keys to sensitive information and decision-making power within their organizations.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>dCTIDH: Fast &amp; Deterministic CTIDH</strong><br>
<em>Fabio Campos, Andreas Hellenbrand, Michael Meyer, Krijn Reijnders</em></p>
<p>This paper presents dCTIDH, a CSIDH implementation that combines two recent developments into a novel state-of-the-art deterministic implementation. We combine the approach of deterministic variants of CSIDH with the batching strategy of CTIDH, which shows that the full potential of this key space has not yet been explored. This high-level adjustment in itself leads to a significant speed-up. To achieve an effective deterministic evaluation in constant time, we introduce Wombats, a new approach to performing isogenies in batches, specifically tailored to the behavior required for deterministic CSIDH using CTIDH batching.</p>

		<p>A great and affordable way to expand</p>
<p>Docking stations can be a great way to expand the capabilities of the devices you already own. While docking stations are usually paired up with laptops, you can also use them for tablets, PC gaming handhelds, and smartphones as well. Of course, if you&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for one, chances are, you&rsquo;ve seen how pricey they can be.</p>
