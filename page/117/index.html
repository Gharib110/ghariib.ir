<p>Lumma Stealer, nefarious info-stealing malware, resurfaces in the cyber threat arena. Defenders recently uncovered an advanced adversary campaign distributing Lumma Stealer through GitHub infrastructure along with other malware variants, including SectopRAT, Vidar, and Cobeacon.</p>
<h2 id="detect-lumma-stealer-sectoprat-vidar-cobeacon-deployed-via-github">Detect Lumma Stealer, SectopRAT, Vidar, Cobeacon Deployed via GitHub</h2>
<p>Lumma Stealer is a notorious data-stealing malware that extracts credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, system details, and files while connecting to adversary servers to enable further malicious actions. The latest campaign associated with Lumma Stealer’s GitHub-based delivery poses a growing threat to potentially affected organizations and individual users due to a set of sophisticated evasion techniques and offensive capabilities involving the deployment of other malware, such as SectopRAT, Vidar, and Cobeacon. </p>

	<div>
		<p>A critical cybersecurity vulnerability has been uncovered in Contec CMS8000 patient monitors, revealing embedded malware that poses significant risks to patient safety and data security.</p>
<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reported that the devices include a backdoor linked to a hard-coded IP address associated with a Chinese university.</p>
<p>The Contec CMS8000 patient monitor, widely used in hospitals and healthcare facilities, was found to have three major vulnerabilities.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Just days after we uncovered a campaign targeting Google Ads accounts, a similar attack has surfaced, this time aimed at Microsoft advertisers. These malicious ads, appearing on Google Search, are designed to steal the login information of users trying to access Microsoft’s advertising platform.</p>
<p>Microsoft does purchase ad space on its rival’s dominant search engine; however, we found Google sponsored results for “Microsoft Ads” (formerly known as Bing Ads) that contained malicious links created by impostors.</p>

		<p>We hardly knew ye.</p>
<p>Every so often, Microsoft will remove a pretty useful feature from one of its apps. Sometimes, they evaporate for seemingly no reason, and sometimes, the feature just wasn&rsquo;t seeing enough use to justify continuing its support. Today, we&rsquo;re seeing an example of the latter case: Microsoft has announced that it&rsquo;s sunsetting the Microsoft Defender VPN feature at the end of February. It&rsquo;s a move that&rsquo;s bound to prompt a lot of questions, including &ldquo;When on Earth did Microsoft Defender get a VPN feature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>PowerToys&rsquo; Advanced Paste is a handy tool for anyone who wants to take copying and pasting to the next level on Windows. However, Microsoft wants to take it even further by incorporating two new paste actions that allow the transcoding of media files to help users convert them from one format to another.</p>

It provides a suite of tools, libraries and services to monitor, retrieve and analyze performance metrics from different systems, services and applications. PCP is designed for scalability, enabling it to monitor anything from a single server to a large, distributed network of machi</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleHelp RMM that could allow for arbitrary code execution. SimpleHelp is a popular remote access software. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities when chained together could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
