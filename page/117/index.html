		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is writing law today. This has required no changes in legislative procedure or the rules of legislative bodies—all it takes is one legislator, or legislative assistant, to use generative AI in the process of drafting a bill.</p>
<p>In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and legislatures around the world to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy research and analysis, and more. A Brazilian municipality &hellip;</p>

		<p>President Biden has signed a new cybersecurity order. It has a bunch of provisions, most notably using the US governments procurement power to improve cybersecurity practices industry-wide.</p>
<p>Some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents­—namely, the security failures of federal contractors.</p>
<p>The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on a mandate that debuted in 2022 in response to &hellip;</p>

		<p>For businesses that handle sensitive customer information, achieving SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) compliance is not just a good practice — it&rsquo;s often a necessity. SOC 2 is a rigorous auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that assesses a service organization&rsquo;s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</p>
<p>While SOC 2 is not legally mandated, it has become increasingly important, in part due to breaches consistently seen in news headlines. Obtaining SOC 2 compliance allows customers to build trust with service organizations because they know their data is being properly stored and security controls have been assessed by a third party.</p>

		<p>DevSecOps streamlines software development by allowing teams to ship features quickly and providing short feedback cycles for customers. These short feedback cycles can be used to monitor the impact of a feature from the time it is shipped and to inform developers and product managers about the success or failure of a given deployment.</p>
<p>GitLab, as an agnostic DevSecOps platform, can act as an integration point for different CI/CD tools that often contribute to user-facing functionality. For example, the vulnerability report, which displays all detected vulnerabilities, is visible as a single functionality, but the data in the report may come from a number of different tools in various pipelines.</p>

<p>Linux Kernel 6.13 is released! Linus Torvalds announced it in lkml.org on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week, so I’ve tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release.</em></p>
<p>It’s mostly some final driver fixes (gpu and networking dominating – normal), with some doc updates too. And various little stuff all over. The shortlog is appended for people who want to see the details (and, as always, it’s just the shortlog for the last week, the full 6.13 log is obviously much too big).</p>

But what do these requirements mean for spacecraft manufacturers? What challenges will they face? And what will they need to do to comply? Keep reading to find out. Understanding the Cyber Space Threat While NASA has cybersecurity requirements for its spacecraft in operation, these requirements do not extend to the spacecraft acquisition and development lifecycle. Essentially, NASA contractors are not currently&hellip;</p>

		<p>The problem with my other TanStack start post was: I did not use the keycloakJS official client library.</p>
<p>Plus I wanted a solution that also works with TanStack-Router loading, pre-fetching and router-based context.</p>
<p>Here is the example where it all comes together:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/progwise/tanstack-start-keycloak">https://github.com/progwise/tanstack-start-keycloak</a></p>
<p>It turned out that the biggest issue is to invalidate the router-context correctly. It was not enough to call</p>
<p><code>router.invalidate()</code></p>
<p>on</p>
<p><code>keycloak.onAuthSuccess</code>`</p>
<p>But I needed to re-calculate the context using some beforeLoad:</p>
