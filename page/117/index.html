<p>Financially motivated hackers are behind an ongoing malicious campaign targeting Poland and Germany. These phishing attacks aim to deploy multiple payloads, including Agent Tesla, Snake Keylogger, and a novel backdoor dubbed TorNet, which is delivered via PureCrypter malware. </p>
<h2 id="detect-tornet-backdoor">Detect TorNet Backdoor</h2>
<p>A significant rise in phishing campaigns, with a 202% increase in phishing messages over the second half of 2024, indicates that this attack vector continues to be a persistent threat. The emergence of a TorNet backdoor distributed via PureCrypter malware in an ongoing phishing campaign, which uses advanced detection evasion techniques, requires swift and proactive responses from defenders. </p>

<p>With cyber threats on the rise, organizations are increasingly concerned about their security posture. One area of prime concern is web applications and APIs that power key business processes. To protect mission-critical applications, efficient web application firewalls (WAFs) are required to block malicious traffic. A well-configured WAF acts as the first line of defense against external threats maintaining trust, achieving compliance, and ensuring uninterrupted operations. Periodic testing of security solutions ensures they are behaving as expected and are resilient enough to withstand complex and ever-evolving cyber threats. Often, resource-constrained security teams do not have the time to proactively test their […]</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that aims to simulate human intelligence through machines. AI can be classified into three distinct modes based on its capabilities: <strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</strong>, <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>, and <strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong>. These modes represent the stages of AI development and define its potential and limitations.</p>
<p>While <strong>ANI</strong> is already a part of many industries today, <strong>AGI</strong> and <strong>ASI</strong> represent future milestones in AI evolution. This post will explore each of the three modes of AI, their major features, and the implications they have for technology and society.</p>

<p>DevOps is a set of practices that aims to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). By emphasizing automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, DevOps ensures that software is delivered faster, more reliably, and with higher quality. DevOps is often structured into four key stages, each playing a vital role in optimizing the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>These four stages—<strong>Plan</strong>, <strong>Develop</strong>, <strong>Build</strong>, and <strong>Monitor</strong>—represent the continuous process of software delivery. By understanding and optimizing these stages, organizations can streamline their development processes and deliver better products to their customers. This post will explore each of these stages in detail, highlighting their major features and importance in the DevOps pipeline.</p>

<p>DevOps architecture refers to the structure and design of tools, processes, and practices used to support DevOps principles such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration. A well-defined DevOps architecture helps streamline development workflows, automate manual tasks, and ensure faster, more reliable software releases.</p>
<p>DevOps architecture is not a one-size-fits-all approach but can vary depending on the organization’s goals, technology stack, and team structure. This post will explore the key components and stages of DevOps architecture, highlighting their major features and how they contribute to successful DevOps implementation.</p>
