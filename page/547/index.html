<p>The Kali community is a pretty crazy thing. There are folks all over the world doing interesting things with Kali Linux and far too often, these cool projects get overlooked. Part of the problem is that the community is spread out all over the ’net. We’re continuing to help build the Kali community to help with this problem, but that’s a slightly longer topic. In the meantime, we want to keep you well-informed about cool stuff that’s happening in our world-wide community. We’ll also be reaching out to standout members of our community, highlight their work, and get them involved in building our new community.</p>
