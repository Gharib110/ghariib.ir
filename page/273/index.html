<p>[Cody Lammer] built a sweet CNC router. But as always, when you build a “thing”, you inevitably figure out how to build a better “thing” in the process, so here we are with Cody’s CNC machine v2.0. And it looks like CNC v1.0 was no slouch, so there’s no shortage of custom milled aluminum here.</p>
<p>The standout detail of this build is that almost all of the drive electronics and logic are hidden inside the gantry itself, making cabling a <em>lot</em> less of a nightmare than it usually is. While doing this was impossible in the past, because everything was just so bulky, he manages to get an ESP32 and the stepper drivers onto a small enough board that it can move along with the parts that it controls. FluidNC handles the G-Code interpretation side of things, along with providing a handy WiFi interface. This also allows him to implement a nice jog wheel and a very handy separate position and status indicator LCD on the gantry itself.</p>

<p>The U.S. government took both defensive and offensive actions this week, starting with the launch of the Cyber Trust Mark and followed by sanctions on the company behind Flax Typhoon threat actors.</p>
<p>The White House first introduced the Cyber Trust Mark as a cybersecurity label for internet-connected devices. The label allows consumers to identify safe ‘smart’ products such as TVs, appliances, baby monitors, and fitness trackers. Devices that meet NIST’s criteria, including strong default passwords, regular software updates, and data protection measures, can display the mark.</p>

<p>With how easy it is to get into stereoscopic 3D media, it&rsquo;s only natural for someone people to want to create their own videos for the format. Well, if you&rsquo;re part of that camp and you have a spare Raspberry Pi 5 lying around, today&rsquo;s your lucky day. This cool Raspberry Pi project lets you create a camera that streams footage in a stereoscopic format, so you can see things in 3D through visors like Google Cardboard.</p>
