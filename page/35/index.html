	<div>
		<p>Have you ever wondered what the Dark Web is? How to access it? Or even better, how to deploy your site to the dark web? Well I got you today. In this article we shall look at how you can deploy your site on the Tor network, which is a Dark web that allows clients and Servers to navigate and exist on the Internet Anonymously.</p>
<p>The Internet is not all you see, it&rsquo;s divided into 2 parts, The Clearnet and The Darknet. They are differentiated by Traceability. You see on the Clearnet, when a message is sent over the network, it&rsquo;s easy to trace the client that sent it and the destination server that it was sent to. That&rsquo;s not the case on the Darknet, on the Darknet the location/IP address of the server and the client are not traceable. The client sends a message to the server but doesn&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s located.</p>

<p>Tax season is a prime time for cybercriminals, especially those running phishing scams to steal W-2s. With many people filing their tax returns, scammers take advantage of the rush to trick unsuspecting individuals into handing over sensitive financial data. This blog highlights the rise in tax-related cybercrime and offers practical tips to keep your information safe.</p>
<p>W-2 phishing scams often involve emails that appear to be from the IRS or another official source, requesting personal information. These phishing emails can be highly sophisticated, often mimicking the look and feel of legitimate communications. The goal is to trick the recipient into revealing confidential data, such as social security numbers and financial information, which the perpetrator can then use for fraudulent purposes. The first step in protecting against such scams is understanding how they work and being able to recognize the red flags.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the month of top seeds, big upsets, and Cinderella runs by the underdogs. With March Madness basketball cranking up, a fair share of online betting will be sure to follow‚Äîalong with online betting scams.¬†</p>
<p>Since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018, individual states can determine their own laws for sports betting. Soon after, states leaped at the opportunity to legalize it in some form or other. Today, nearly 40 states and the District of Columbia have ‚Äúlive and legal‚Äù sports betting, meaning that people can bet on single-game sports through a retail or online sportsbook or a combination of the two in their state.¬†</p>

		<p><em>This is the second part of a two three four-part series, which covers some recent results on ‚Äúverifiable computation‚Äù and possible pitfalls that could occur there. This post won‚Äôt make much sense on its own, so I urge you to start with the first part.</em></p>
<p>In the previous post we introduced a handful of concepts, including (1) the notion of ‚Äúverifiable computation‚Äù proof systems (sometimes inaccurately called ‚ÄúZK‚Äù by the Ethereum community), (2) hash functions, and (3) some ideal models that we use for our security proofs, and (4) the idea that these ‚Äúideal models‚Äù are bogus ‚Äî and sometimes they can make us confident in schemes that are totally insecure in the real world.</p>
