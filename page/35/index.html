<p>6G could be available by the end of the decade, which should decrease latency and connectivity speeds for users. However, these wireless networks present new cybersecurity challenges. What should industry professionals prepare for? What Is 6G? 6G will be the sixth generation of wireless technology once it arrives. Experts say it could debut by 2030, though companies started 5G-Advanced integration in 2024. Terahertz (THz) frequencies will be a key part of 6G, as it can quickly transmit data and reduce latency. This band is more powerful because it incorporates unused frequency bands&hellip;</p>
