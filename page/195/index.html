<p>ICS and Building Management Systems (BMS) support several protocols such as <em><strong>Modbus</strong></em>, <em>Bacnet</em>, <em>Fieldbus</em> and so on. Those protocols were designed to provide read/write control over sensors and actuators from a central point. </p>
<p>Driven by our past experience with BMS, we decided to release our own methodology and internal tool used for proactive attack surface analysis within systems supporting the Modbus protocol.</p>
<h3 id="the-modbus-protocol">The Modbus Protocol</h3>
<p>Modbus is a well defined protocol described on modbus.org. It was created in 1979 and has become one of the most used standards for communication between industrial electronic devices in a wide range of buses and network.</p>

		<p>A bombshell report was released in December of 2024 by the House Judiciary Committee, revealing that a massive and constitutionally dubious surveillance operation has been underway by the federal government against countless Americans. Titled, <em>“How the Federal Government Weaponized the Bank Secrecy Act to Spy on Americans,”</em> its key findings demonstrate that the FBI and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have been working together to undermine the 4th Amendment and conduct widespread <em>warrantless surveillance</em> on the financial transactions of innocent U.S. citizens engaging in constitutionally protected behavior.</p>

		<p>The United States ban on TikTok went into effect on January 19, 2025, and although service began to be restored after just 14 hours, it was only close to the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States that associated DNS traffic started to recover to closer to previous levels. In this post, we analyze the events of January 19 and 20, and what they meant for TikTok-related DNS traffic, but also other competitors (including their growth outside the US).</p>

<p>There has been such a hype about the Log4j issue and since IMQ Minded Security mission has always been about fixing, this informal post is about <em>what&rsquo;s going on</em>, <em>how to check</em> if someone&rsquo;s system is likely affected and <em>how to fix the issue</em>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 12-17-2021</strong>: Since several bypasses to the mitigations implemented on version 2.15/16 were found, <strong>be sure to update to</strong>  <strong>Log4j 2.3.1 (for Java 6), 2.12.3 (for Java 7), or 2.17.0 (for Java 8 and later) as described here and here ASAP!</strong></p>
