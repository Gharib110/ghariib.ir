		<p>The United States ban on TikTok went into effect on January 19, 2025, and although service began to be restored after just 14 hours, it was only close to the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States that associated DNS traffic started to recover to closer to previous levels. In this post, we analyze the events of January 19 and 20, and what they meant for TikTok-related DNS traffic, but also other competitors (including their growth outside the US).</p>

<p>There has been such a hype about the Log4j issue and since IMQ Minded Security mission has always been about fixing, this informal post is about <em>what&rsquo;s going on</em>, <em>how to check</em> if someone&rsquo;s system is likely affected and <em>how to fix the issue</em>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 12-17-2021</strong>: Since several bypasses to the mitigations implemented on version 2.15/16 were found, <strong>be sure to update to</strong>  <strong>Log4j 2.3.1 (for Java 6), 2.12.3 (for Java 7), or 2.17.0 (for Java 8 and later) as described here and here ASAP!</strong></p>

		<p>Log4J has been in the spotlight for the past two weeks for a new attack vector which relies on Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). In this blog, we will detail the new mitigation introduced in 2.15 and the bypass we found using a Time of Check, Time of Use vulnerability (TOCTOU). This vector was also discovered independently by Alvaro Muñoz and Tony Torralba. It is likely that many other individuals have reported related bypass techniques because there were multiple weaknesses in the same Java class (<code>JndiManager</code>).</p>

		<h3 id="what-is-a-private-proxy"><strong>What is a Private Proxy?</strong></h3>
<p>A <strong>private proxy</strong> is a dedicated proxy server that provides a unique IP address exclusively for use by a single user or client. Unlike shared proxies, which are used by multiple people simultaneously, private proxies ensure that no other user can access or share the same IP address. This exclusivity enhances performance, reliability, and security.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymity and Privacy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Masks the user’s actual IP address, providing anonymity while browsing or performing online activities.</p>
