		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-0682<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 25, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 1¬†day, 2¬†hours ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.33.0 via the &rsquo;trx_sc_reviews&rsquo; shortcode &rsquo;type&rsquo; attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-24858<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2¬†hours, 22¬†minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 0.0 | NA<br>

<h2 id="firstly-whats-deepseek-r1">Firstly, What&rsquo;s DeepSeek-R1?</h2>
<p>DeepSeek-R1 is an open-source reasoning model developed by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company which can work on tasks that require logical inference, mathematical problem-solving, and real-time decision-making.</p>

<p>Not too far away from where this is being written is one of Uncle Sam‚Äôs NATO outposts, a satellite earth station for their comms system. Its most prominent feature is a radome, a huge golf-ball-like structure visible for miles, that protects a large parabolic antenna from the British weather. It makes sense not just for a superpower to protect its antennas from the elements, and [saveitforparts] is doing the same with a geodesic dome for his radio telescope experiments. But what effect does it have on the received signal? He‚Äôs made a video to investigate.</p>

It‚Äôs a story of how a simple idea, born from a last-minute spark of inspiration, led to a meaningful project that resonated with the judges. I hope my journey inspires you to embrace your creativity, trust your instincts, and share your passions with the world.</p>

		<p>Windows is the most popular desktop operating system, but does that mean it&rsquo;s good for power users? Well, for the most part, yes.</p>
<p>Windows may be the most popular desktop operating system in the world, but it does have a reputation for sometimes being frustrating to use for one reason or another. And with Linux sometimes being brought up by people who are generally more tech-savvy, it begs the question of whether Windows is still a good OS for power users.</p>

<p>Do they teach networking history classes yet? Or is it still too soon?</p>
<p>I was reading [Al]‚Äôs first installment of the Forgotten Internet series, on UUCP. The short summary is that it was a system for sending files across computers that were connected, intermittently, by point-to-point phone lines. Each computer knew the phone numbers of a few others, but none of them had anything like a global routing map, and IP addresses were still in the future. Still, it enabled file transfer and even limited remote access across the globe. And while some files contained computer programs, others files contained more human messages, which makes UUCP also a precursor to e-mail.</p>
