<p>On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, as my husband and I sat on the beach, sipping champagne and waiting for the fireworks ✨, we asked each other about our goals for this year. Goal-setting is one of those activities I&rsquo;ve done for as long as I can remember. When my husband asked me this, I thought about it for a bit—at this point in time, I hadn&rsquo;t really sat down to set my goals for 2025. But this question prompted me to start gathering my thoughts and thinking about what it was I wanted to achieve this year.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Conditional Constant Function Problem and Its Quantum Solutions: Attacking Feistel Ciphers</strong><br>
<em>Zhenqiang Li, Shuqin Fan, Fei Gao, Yonglin Hao, Xichao Hu, Linchun Wan, Hongwei Sun, Qi Su</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we define the conditional constant function problem (CCFP) and, for a special case of CCFP, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving it efficiently. Such an algorithm enables us to make new evaluations to the quantum security of Feistel block cipher in the case where a quantum adversary only has the ability to make online queries in a classical manner, which is relatively realistic. Specifically, we significantly improved the chosen-plaintext key recovery attacks on two Feistel block cipher variants known as Feistel-KF and Feistel-FK. For Feistel-KF, we construct a 3-round distinguisher based on the special case of CCFP and propose key recovery attacks mounting to $r&gt;3$ rounds. For Feistel-FK, our CCFP based distinguisher covers 4 rounds and the key recovery attacks are applicable for $r&gt;4$ rounds. Utilizing our CCFP solving algorithm, we are able to reduce the classical memory complexity of our key recovery attacks from the previous exponential $O(2^{cn})$ to $O(1)$. The query complexity of our key recovery attacks on Feistel-KF is also significantly reduced from $O(2^{cn})$ to $O(1)$ where $c$&rsquo;s are constants. Our key recovery results enjoy the current optimal complexities. They also indicate that quantum algorithms solving CCFP could be more promising than those solving the period finding problem.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Constant latency and finality for dynamically available DAG</strong><br>
<em>Hans Schmiedel, Runchao Han, Qiang Tang, Ron Steinfeld, Jiangshan Yu</em></p>
<p>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based protocols have shown great promise to improve the performance of blockchains. The CAP theorem shows that it is impossible to have a single system that achieves both liveness (known as dynamic availability) and safety under network partition.This paper explores two types of DAG-based protocols prioritizing liveness or safety, named structured dissemination and Graded Common Prefix (GCP), respectively. For the former, we introduce the first DAG-based protocol with constant expected latency, providing high throughput dynamic availability under the sleepy model. Its expected latency is $3Delta$ and its throughput linearly scales with participation. We validate these expected performance improvements over existing constant latency sleepy model BFT by running prototypes of each protocol across multiple machines. The latter, GCP, is a primitive that provides safety under network partition, while being weaker than standard consensus. As a result, we are able to obtain a construction that runs in only $2$ communication steps, as opposed to the $4$ steps of existing low latency partially synchronous BFT. In addition, GCP can easily avoid relying on single leaders&rsquo; proposals, becoming more resilient to crashes. We also validate these theoretical benefits of GCP experimentally. We leverage our findings to extend the Ebb-and-Flow framework, where two BFT sub-protocols allow different types of clients in the same system to prioritize either liveness or safety. Our extension integrates our two types of DAG-based protocols. This provides a hybrid DAG-based protocol with high throughput, dynamical availability, and finality under network partitions, without running a standard consensus protocol twice as required in existing work.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Checkout for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin&rsquo;s &lsquo;checkout_for_paypal&rsquo; shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.32 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 6.4 | MEDIUM<br>
