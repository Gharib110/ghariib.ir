<p>In this life nearly every relationship we create and maintain is built upon expectations. You do this, I’ll do that, and together we’ll fail to oppose entropy but stand a chance at plotting and navigating a loose course through it. These expectations extend beyond the individual, past the family, and onto society.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day Fourteen</em></p>
<p>When I agreed to take part in Winter Break of Code, I had no idea what to really expect. While many people questioned my choice to spend my winter vacation writing code, I was excited for the opportunity to spend a week hanging out with an eclectic group of people while doing two of my favorite things: coding and surfing.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day Thirteen</em></p>
<p>My ten-year-old mind was completely blown when I realized that I could eavesdrop on the walkie-talkie conversations of the other kids in my neighborhood. I rode my bike to the library in stunned silence, found a book about codes and puzzles, and raced home to my computer. I reluctantly transformed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> into something other than a conduit for modified games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIBBLES.BAS">NIBBLES.BAS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GORILLA.BAS">GORILLA.BAS</a>, and wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a> implementation that worked in both directions. That ended up being the easy part.</p>

<p>A few days ago, someone suggested that we go scuba diving and I said “yeah sure, that sounds fun”. Once we actually got to the dive site I realized I had no clue what I signed up for. I was scared out of my fucking mind, squirming against the ocean’s currents, and convinced I would have to go back to shore while everyone else had fun since I was too much of a wuss. It took some time and a fair amount of patience from my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went from frantically holding my instructor’s hand to feeling comfortable exploring the reefs on my own. Instead of feeling disoriented by being underwater, it began to feel natural to swim among tropical fish and sea turtles.</p>

<p>Every morning at standup I’d watch the knife spin in slow motion, dread filling my chest and a voice in my head repeating, over and over, “not Slytherin.” (The target of the knife is the author of the next day’s blog post). I wasn’t sure that I could find new ways to marvel at the wonderful absurdity of stepping on a plane and trading reality for this – a chance to work on the world with a group of people that I’ve only admired from afar. I wasn’t sure that I had anything to say that hadn’t already been said by my new friends.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code Day Ten</em></p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/clpwn">Jake</a>, one of the brilliant full-timers on <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp">Open Whisper Systems</a>, looked up from his laptop and asked me with a smile, “So, Yoko, what’s your life story? How did you come to love humans so much?” It was a whimsical way of asking why I do what I do and why I am here. Having studied Human Computer Interaction and being a user experience (UX) designer, I’ve been asked variations of this question many times before. But it was on this trip I realized my answer needs a little probing.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, an email full of information to help prep for Winter Break of Code popped up in my inbox. Throughout my personal countdown to the day I got to leave San Francisco for Hawaii, one line from that email continuously resonated throughout my mind: “Have your development environment ready to go.”</p>
