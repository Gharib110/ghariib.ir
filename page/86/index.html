		<p>Late last year, Rubrik announced a collaboration with Red Hat to support Rubrik Security Cloud on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, and we’re excited to share that this is now official. Rubrik Security Cloud paired with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization helps organizations more easily migrate and protect virtual machines (VMs) and applications running on a consistent, trusted and comprehensive application platform. As enterprise organizations migrate their workloads from VM environments to cloud-native platforms such as OpenShift, they must understand differences in storage between virtualiz</p>

		<p>Bitdefender Labs warns of an active campaign by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group, targeting organizations by capturing credentials and delivering malware through fake LinkedIn job offers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn may be a vital tool for job seekers and professionals, but it has also become a playground for cybercriminals exploiting its credibility. From fake job offers and elaborate phishing schemes to scams and even state-sponsored threat actors who prey on people’s career aspirations and trust in profess</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Learning from Functionality Outputs: Private Join and Compute in the Real World</strong><br>
<em>Francesca Falzon, Tianxin Tang</em></p>
<p>Private Join and Compute (PJC) is a two-party protocol recently proposed by Google for various use-cases, including ad conversion (Asiacrypt 2021) and which generalizes their deployed private set intersection sum (PSI-SUM) protocol (EuroS&amp;P 2020).</p>
<p>PJC allows two parties, each holding a key-value database, to privately evaluate the inner product of the values whose keys lie in the intersection. While the functionality output is not typically considered in the security model of the MPC literature, it may pose real-world privacy risks, thus raising concerns about the potential deployment of protocols like PJC.</p>

LibreOffice 25.2 has been released, this year’s first major update to the leading open-source office software for Windows, macOS, and Linux. As you’d expect, the update delivers a sizeable set of changes spread throughout the productivity suite, including notable UI changes, accessibility improvements, and more important interoperability buffs to support cross-suite workflows. It’s important to remember that open-source software like LibreOffice doesn’t appear out of thin air; it’s made by humans, many unpaid, others paid to work on specific parts only. We all have personal wish-lists of features and changes we want our favourite open-source apps to add, but we […]</p>

		<p>With the help of the following command, you can easily find top 10 processes that are consuming high CPU resources on any Linux system. <code>ps</code> is the default command available in most of Linux operating system that provide details about processes in system.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ps -eo pid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head
</code></pre><p>Output will print top 10 processes that are consuming high cpu on your system in descending order. You can also use top command to filter processes by cpu utilization.</p>

<p>You know, it’s a tale as old as custom mechanical keyboards. [penkia] couldn’t find any PCBs with 36 keys and Gateron low-profile switch footprints, so they made their own and called it the LoremIpsum36. Isn’t it lovely?</p>

This baby runs on an RP2040, which sits flush as can be in a cutout in the PCB. This maneuver, along with the LP switches in hard-to-find SK-33 sockets results in quite the thin board.</p>

<p>The aptly named [LightingOnDemand] has created a Lorentz cannon that can fire a lightning bolt. Honestly, as you can see in the video below, it looks like something from a bad 1950s science fiction movie. The inspiration was researchers using rockets trailing thin wires to attract lightning.</p>

		<p>DPRK &lsquo;Contagious Interview&rsquo; campaign continues to target Mac users with new variants of FERRET malware and Github devs with repo spam.</p>
<p>Last week Apple pushed a signature update to its on-device malware tool XProtect to block several variants of what it called the macOS Ferret family: FROSTYFERRET_UI, FRIENDLYFERRET_SECD, and MULTI_FROSTYFERRET_CMDCODES. This DPRK-attributed malware family was first described by researchers in December and further in early January and identified as part of the North Korean Contagious Interview campaign, in which threat actors lure targets to install malware through the job interview process.</p>
