	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In a troubling development for web publishers, numerous site owners are reporting dramatic drops in their Google AdSense earnings since early January 2025, with some seeing their monthly income plummet from comfortable four-figures to barely enough for a month&rsquo;s worth of instant noodles. This sudden downturn has left many content creators in crisis mode, particularly those relying on this income for student loan payments and basic living expenses.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-problem">The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>The impact appears to be widespread across various niches, but particularly noticeable in the technology and educational content sectors. One CS student&rsquo;s story particularly stands out: after five years of building a programming tutorial site from their freshman year study notes, their monthly AdSense revenue crashed from $1,500 to $218 â€“ just days before their $890 student loan payment was due, on this discussion about google adsense revenue drop in the very beginning of this year.</p>

		<p>The recent temporary shutdown of TikTok in the U.S. and its swift restoration underscored the platformâ€™s immense cultural and economic significance. With over 170 million American users and countless businesses relying on TikTok for engagement, marketing, and revenue, the platform has become a cornerstone of modern digital ecosystems. For developers and businesses, TikTokâ€™s APIs offer a gateway to integrate its powerful functionalities into their applications, enabling enhanced user experiences and data-driven insights.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>React 19 brings a game-changing improvement with the <strong><code>use</code></strong> API, making data fetching and asynchronous operations in your components a breeze! ðŸš€ This new approach lets you write cleaner, more readable code by integrating directly with Suspense, eliminating the need for cumbersome lifecycle methods and extra state management. ðŸ˜Š</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The <strong><em>use</em></strong> API in React 19 simplifies <em>fetching data and working with asynchronous resources directly</em> within a component&rsquo;s render function. This eliminates the need for separate lifecycle methods or complex state management for loading and error states.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Why buy a handheld when you can build one?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of SBC-related news for XDA, which makes it pretty hard for me to be truly blown away by a project. Fortunately, that only means that the ones that do amaze me are truly something stunning. Such is the case of this DIY OLED handheld, which uses an SBC to create a device you can feasibly build for yourself at home.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Nothing ever truly dies on the internet and these retro operating systems are live and kicking and ready for you to use.</p>
<p>Retro gaming is having a huge revival right now, with hardware emulating classic consoles so you can use original cartridges, to emulators to create retro PCs, and Atari releasing a modern version of the 7800 from the mid-80s for you to use any old cartridges you still have in the attic. It&rsquo;s a fantastic time to be a classic gaming fan, but what about the operating systems that we used to use?</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The eGPU market has been stagnant for years but I believe it&rsquo;s ready to rumble again.</p>
<p>When first introduced to the market, external graphics cards or eGPUs were hailed as the savior of gaming on the go, able to increase the graphical power of the best laptops by offloading the processing to the eGPU. While this was a fantastic idea in theory, the practical applications and slower connectivity standards of the time conspired to make them lackluster at best, and the market went stagnant. Most of the eGPU enclosures available now were released years ago, and the manufacturers haven&rsquo;t really been in a rush to release updated versions.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>2025 is the year your NAS setup gets smarter</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways your typical home NAS differs from its enterprise counterpart, most of which have to do with how the NAS holds, processes, and distributes data. Unlike home users, businesses face far more advanced and taxing needs â€” managing multiple users, applications, and environments. To handle all this complexity, it is crucial for businesses to leverage all the tools at their disposal to maximize the potential of their NAS while ensuring quick accessibility, data safety, and readiness for any data crisis.</p>

		<p>If you only use CMD as your CLI, check out why PowerShell is a phenomenal built-in utility on Windows 11.</p>
<p>If you have been a long-time Windows user, you are likely familiar with using the Command Prompt for your command-line interface (CLI) work. However, the utility you should be using is PowerShell. It is a far more powerful command line tool for Windows and beyond.</p>
