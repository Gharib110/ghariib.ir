		<p>When was the last time you enjoyed a software update? If you’re struggling to remember, you’re not alone. While engineers can now deploy code changes in seconds, making those changes useful and enjoyable is not easy.</p>
<p>Progressive Delivery, a term coined by James Governor in 2018, offers a fresh framework for addressing these challenges. With the upcoming release of Progressive Delivery: How To Build the Right Thing for the Right People at the Right Time by James Governor, Kimberly Harrison, Heidi Waterhouse, and Adam Zimman, let’s explore this transformative approach to software delivery.</p>

<p>Love it or hate it, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and other AI tools are reshaping the modern workplace. As AI becomes a critical part of daily work, establishing guardrails and deploying monitoring tools for these tools is critical. That’s where Check Point’s Harmony SASE comes in. We’ve already talked about Browser Security and the clipboard control feature to help define what types of information can’t be shared with LLMs. For monitoring these services, our GenAI Security service shows exactly which AI tools your team is using, who is using them, what kind of information they’re sharing with the […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>It doesn’t matter whether your organization is a huge multinational business enterprise or a one-person operation. At some point, your computer networks and systems will be attacked by someone with criminal intent. Cybersecurity attacks, in all their various forms, are inevitable and relentless. This quick glossary, written by Mark W. Kaelin for TechRepublic Premium, explains &hellip;</p>

		<p>We are excited to announce the release of a new capability in Bitbucket Pipelines that will improve your experience diagnosing issues with your pipeline runs, by allowing you to view and access previous runs within the Pipelines UI.</p>

<p>The previous pipeline <strong>Runs</strong> dropdown will not show up if you re-run an entire pipeline, because re-running an entire pipeline creates an entirely separate pipeline record, rather than an additional run on an existing pipeline.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The security of an organization’s network infrastructure is paramount.<br>
Routers, switches, and wireless configurations serve as the backbone of enterprise networks, facilitating seamless<br>
communication and data flow. However, if not properly configured and regularly assessed, these critical components<br>
can become vulnerable entry points for cyber threats. Engaging third-party assessors to conduct regular configuration<br>
reviews across global networks is not only a best practice but also aligns with various regulatory requirements.</p>

		<p>The Obsbot Meet SE brings high-quality webcams to the masses, and it&rsquo;s probably the one most people should get.</p>
<p>Obsbot typically makes pretty high-end webcams and while I usually love them, I always acknowledge they&rsquo;re not for everyone because they&rsquo;re fairly expensive. With the Meet SE, Obsbot wanted to change that perception by introducing the cheapest camera in its lineup.</p>
