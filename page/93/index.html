	<div>
		<p>A <strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong> is a security solution designed to protect web applications by monitoring, filtering, and blocking malicious HTTP/S traffic.</p>
<p>Operating at the OSI model’s application layer (Layer 7), a WAF acts as a reverse proxy between users and web applications, analyzing incoming requests and outgoing responses to identify and mitigate potential threats.</p>
<p>It is particularly effective against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If 2024 taught us anything, it’s that a proactive, no-compromises approach to security is essential for 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>Nation-states and advanced cybercriminals are making significant investments in infrastructure and automation to intensify familiar cyberattack patterns; password attacks, for example, escalated from 579 incidents per second in 20211 to 7,000 in 2024.2 These groups are also adopting emerging technologies such as AI to create deepfakes and personalized spear-phishing campaigns that manipulate people into granting unauthorized access.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t be quick to splurge on the RTX 5090</p>
<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 5090 is the most powerful consumer graphics card you can buy in 2025. One of the main reasons it costs $2,000 is that it has no competition from AMD and Intel. However, even if you can afford to spend that much money on this flagship graphics card, you have to be very careful because there are some important factors to consider before you put it inside your case. Otherwise, you may have to spend even more on additional components to enjoy all the performance gains it brings to the table.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As organizations increasingly adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and manage their cloud environments, ensuring the security of these configurations has become a critical priority.</p>
<p>IaC allows teams to define infrastructure using code, enabling rapid deployment and scalability, but it also introduces risks such as misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can expose systems to attacks.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, specialized tools have emerged to scan IaC templates for vulnerabilities, enforce compliance with security standards, and ensure robust cloud infrastructure.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The future of the creative industries isn&rsquo;t locked behind subscription paywalls</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons you might choose to use open-source tools, whether it’s to avoid the Adobe corporation and find the best open-source alternatives to Adobe tools, or because you want to be in control of your privacy and security. The future of creative tools and software lies in open-source options for many reasons. Open-source tools will never diminish your creativity or limit your results.</p>

	<div>
		<p>For calibrating your 3D printer, Benchy isn&rsquo;t the only game in town. Here are other 3D test models you can use to dial in your 3D printer.</p>
<p>Benchy is a fantastic tool for testing 3D printer settings and identifying potential issues. Each model tests different printer functions, such as retraction settings, bridging, and overhang angles. Examining these diverse prints allows you to understand how your machine works in various situations.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Query preprocessing is a crucial step in customer-centric applications, ensuring accurate routing and action decisions. Instead of training separate models, I useSetFit with a multi-head classifier— a single shared embedding space with independent classification heads.</p>
<p>Each head specialises in one task, allowing task-specific learning while maintaining efficiency through shared representations. Positive and negative pairs are created using (intent, domain, hitl(human in the loop)) tuples for contrastive learning, ensuring the model effectively distinguishes related queries. This structured approach balances efficiency and flexibility, making it ideal for real-time applications where query classification must be both accurate and scalable. This is just an example. You may modify it as per your needs.</p>
