	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>2024 ushered in significant changes for the healthcare industry. Industry-wide digital transformation, remote care expansion, increased merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as well as rapid AI adoption led to unprecedented growth of data and devices. Unfortunately, this increased reliance on health data also coincided with a surge in cyberattacks — 92% of healthcare organizations experienced a cyberattack in 2024. As Palo Alto Networks recently explored in our predictions for the next year, we expect that critical infrastructure sectors, such as healthcare, will face heightened risks with their significant IP and critical data repositories, making them attractive targets and more vulnerable to sophisticated disruptions.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Microsoft Threat Intelligence discovered a new macOS vulnerability that could allow attackers to bypass Apple’s System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS by loading third party kernel extensions. SIP is a security technology that restricts the performance of operations that may compromise system integrity; thus, a SIP bypass affects the overall security of the operating system. Bypassing SIP could lead to serious consequences, such as increasing the potential for attackers and malware authors to successfully install rootkits, create persistent malware, bypass Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC), and expand the attack surface for additional techniques and exploits.</p>

<p>In recent years, many of our applications have been driven by the high volume of data that we are able to collect and process. Some may refer to us being in the age of data. One of the essential aspects of handling such a large amount of data is <strong>anomaly detection</strong> – processes that enable us to identify outliers, data that is outside the bounds of expectation and demonstrate behavior that is out of the norm. In scientific research, anomaly data points could be a cause of technical issues and may need to be discarded when drawing conclusions, or it could lead to new discoveries.</p>

		<p>There were several new releases focusing on automation in 2024, which is just one sign that automation is now officially mission critical. With IT systems and networks more complex than ever, it’s unreasonable and unreliable to try to manage important settings manually. It’s time to embrace and implement automation in 2025. To help, here are the top 10 articles we published last year on the topic of automation.1. Complexity, AI and more: Why automation is now mission-criticalIn this article, author Cindy Russell references a recent IDC study commissioned by Red Hat, which revealed that “</p>
