<p>But sabi pipo no dey optimistic again say dem go fit recover di rest of di money becos of di North Korean knowledge for hacking and laundering of di money.</p>
<p>Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point tok say, “North Korea na veri closed system and closed economy so dem don create successful industry of hacking and laundering and dem no care about di negative impression of cyber crime”</p>

<p>Frankly, most AI tools that students swear by aren’t all that great. Half the time, they generate inaccurate information, give incorrect answers, or overcomplicate things for no reason. NotebookLM doesn’t do any of that.</p>

<p>Law enforcement and digital forensic specialists have long utilized GPUs for password recovery. GPUs excel at this task due to their thousands of parallel processing cores, enabling rapid hash computations. Tools like Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery leverage GPU acceleration to significantly outperform traditional CPUs in brute-force attacks. The new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture doubles the number of INT32 compute units compared to Ada and Ampere. How will this architectural change affect password recovery, and is it worth upgrading to a new GPU?</p>

<p>Just a week ago, we published an article about NVIDIA’s new generation of Blackwell-based graphics cards. Despite a noticeable price hike, performance gains in this generation are minimal, with one notable exception: the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 significantly outperforms its predecessor in all key aspects. However, this GPU has also revealed a potential issue that could make its use in workstations running 24/7 problematic and potentially unsafe.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-connector">The New Connector</h2>
<p>Before diving into the root of the issue, let’s first understand how it arose. Modern GPUs require far more power than what can be delivered through the PCIe slot alone, forcing manufacturers to provide additional power via cables directly from the PSU. Antec, a well-known PSU manufacturer, has published a diagram illustrating the number of cables required to power high-performance graphics cards.</p>

		<p>One of the most common questions I got asked during presentations and conferences is: &ldquo;<strong>During a search and seizure we found a wiped iPhone, what can we do next?</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>First and foremost: <strong>you cannot recover data stored on the device before wiping occurred</strong>.<br>
The encryption keys you need to decrypt the data are gone forever.<br>
Full stop :)</p>
<p>If you are aware of any method, technique, tool or magic box that can do that, please let me know :)</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the Estonian Internet Voting System, IVXV, SoK and Suggestions</strong><br>
<em>Shymaa M. Arafat</em></p>
<p>The Estonian i-voting experience is probably the richest to analyze; a country that is considered a pioneer in digitizing both the government and private sector since 2001, and hence digital voting in 2005, yet there are still some complaints submitted, critics and remarks to consider about the IVXV system. In this paper, we introduce a Systemization of Knowledge of the Estonian IVXV i-voting system and propose some added security enhancements. The presented SoK includes applications implemented by election observers in 2023 &amp; 2024 elections, which, to our knowledge, has never been mentioned and/or analyzed in the academic literature before. The paper also updates the general knowledge about an extra right given to auditors (but not observers) in the June 2024 European election, recent complaints, and about newer solutions suggested by academia in 2024. Finally, we discuss the current system status in 2024 EP elections and propose our own suggestions to some problems stated in the OSCE-ODIHR 2023 report that are still there.</p>
