		<p>In mid-October, we released our 2024 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, which revealed over 600 million identity attacks per day. As multifactor authentication now blocks most password-based attacks, we’re seeing a shift in threat actor tactics and a convergence of nation-state and cybercriminal threat activity. More than 99% of identity attacks are password attacks—often due to predictable human behaviors like easy-to-guess passwords, password reuse, and falling prey to phishing attacks.1 That’s why comprehensive, integrated identity and access management (IAM) should be a core part of any organization’s threat-informed defense. Today we’re honored to announce that for the eighth year in a row, Microsoft has been named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management—placed highest on the Ability to Execute axis. </p>

	<div>
		<p>The holiday season is a time of celebration, but it’s also a high-risk period for cyberattacks. Cybercriminals look to exploit reduced staffing, remote work, and the surge in online activity. As everyone scrambles for last-minute deals, these attackers find it easier than ever to slip through the cracks in your defenses. As a system administrator at […]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Android OS that could allow for remote code execution. Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Apache Struts2, which could allow for remote code execution. Apache Struts2 is an open-source web application framework used for developing Java web applications. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Services whose accounts are configured to have less rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Access Point that could allow for remote code execution. Cisco Unified Industrial Wireless Software for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Access Point is Cisco’s solution to address wireless and mobile use case issues facing enterprises. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to replace any file on the underlying file system. The attacker could then perform any of the following actions: add users with root privileges, modify the device configuration, execute arbitrary code, or cause a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Containerized application development has revolutionized modern software delivery, but slow image builds in CI/CD pipelines can bring developer productivity to a halt. Even with AWS CodeBuild automating application testing and building, teams face challenges like resource constraints, inefficient caching, and complex multi-architecture builds that lead to delays, lower release frequency, and prolonged recovery times.</p>
<p>Enter Docker Build Cloud, a high-performance cloud service designed to streamline image builds, integrate seamlessly with AWS CodeBuild, and reduce build times dramatically. With Docker Build Cloud, you gain powerful cloud-based builders, shared caching, and native multi-architecture support — all while keeping your CI/CD pipelines efficient and your developers focused on delivering value faster.</p>

	<div>
		<p><strong>Traditional security approaches don’t work for AI.</strong> Generative AI technology is already transforming our world and has immense positive potential for cybersecurity and business processes, but traditional security models and controls aren’t enough to manage the security risks associated with this new technology.   </p>
<p>We recently published a new whitepaper that examines the security challenges and opportunities from generative AI, what security must do to adapt to manage risk related to it, how a Zero Trust approach is essential to effectively secure this AI technology (and underlying data), and how different roles across your organization must work together for effective AI security.  </p>
