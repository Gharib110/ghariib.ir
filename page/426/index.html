<p>Microservices have become the go-to approach for building scalable and resilient applications — mainly in the cloud native world. However, the increased complexity of managing communication between these distributed components has given rise to a powerful solution known as service mesh. As a dedicated infrastructure layer, a service mesh provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to streamline and secure interservice communication.</p>

		<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads continue to grow in complexity and scale, the need for powerful and efficient computational resources becomes more critical. Running workloads on Kubernetes allows you to leverage the scalability and self-healing capabilities, however, there are challenges when it comes to managing and optimizing GPU resources. This is where the GPU Operators and plugins step in. They provide a solution to deploy and manage GPUs in Kubernetes.</p>

		<p>Git commands allow developers to manage different versions of code and collaborate as a team. If you&rsquo;re in a Windows environment, you may have heard of Git Bash, a Bash terminal emulator that includes a Windows-friendly version of Git. Discover everything you need to know about installing Git Bash in this guide.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-git-bash-work">How does Git Bash work?</h2>
<p>Git Bash is an application that you can install on Windows operating systems using Git for Windows. This application acts as an emulator to use the Git version control tool on a Bash command terminal.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, a joint offering that brings together GitLab&rsquo;s comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform with Amazon Q&rsquo;s autonomous AI agents in a single, integrated solution.</p>
<p>GitLab Duo with Amazon Q transforms software development by integrating powerful AI agents directly into your daily workflows. Instead of switching between multiple tools, developers can now accelerate key tasks — from feature development to code reviews — all from within GitLab&rsquo;s comprehensive DevSecOps platform. Amazon Q’s AI agents act as intelligent assistants, automating time-consuming tasks like generating code from requirements, creating unit tests, conducting code reviews, and modernizing Java applications. By handling these complex tasks, this joint offering helps teams focus on innovation, while maintaining security and quality standards.</p>

		<p><strong>This message from Sid Sijbrandij and Bill Staples was shared with GitLab team members earlier today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sid:</strong> On today’s earnings call, I announced that I am stepping down as CEO and will remain Executive Chair of the Board. I also introduced GitLab’s new CEO, Bill Staples.</p>
<p>As a Board, we routinely do succession planning. This includes conversations with a number of top executives. We’ve been having these conversations in greater earnest since my cancer returned. Through these discussions, we identified someone uniquely qualified to lead GitLab. I want more time to focus on my cancer treatment and health. My treatments are going well, my cancer is not metastatic, and I&rsquo;m working towards making a full recovery. Stepping down from a role that I love is not easy, but I believe that it is the right decision for GitLab.</p>

		<p>Optimizing GPU utilization is essential in modern computing, particularly for AI and ML processing, where GPUs play a pivotal role due to their unparalleled ability to handle parallel computations and process large datasets rapidly. Modern GPUs are invaluable in these fields. They have thousands of cores that enable very high parallelism. This enables complex model training and real-time data analysis that are impractical with traditional CPUs.</p>
<p>By fully utilizing GPU resources, organizations can accelerate MLOps workflows, achieve faster insights, and enhance the efficiency of their computing infrastructure. This leads to significant cost savings by reducing the need for additional hardware and operational expenses, while also improving scalability and flexibility to meet the dynamic demands of contemporary computational tasks. One key method for optimizing GPU utilization is by sharing the GPUs among different workloads. This is where virtual GPU (vGPU), Multi-Instance GPUs (MIG) and GPU Time-Slicing come to our rescue!</p>

		<p>GitLab is continuously translated by our global community of translators and proofreaders. Through Crowdin, they help make our product more accessible to the world by translating it into 78 languages. GitLab translation community members are volunteer translators, working professionals who are GitLab users, and even university students contributing to translators as part of their classroom projects.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-gitlab-open-core-model-supports-translators">How the GitLab open-core model supports translators</h3>
<p>While this community collaboration is powerful, translators often face a crucial challenge: understanding the full context of the text that they are translating.</p>

		<p>Writing PHP application code and ensuring the application is running smoothly in production are often two different skills sets owned by two different engineers. GitLab aims to bridge the gap by enabling the engineer who has written the PHP application code to also deploy it into Google Cloud Platform with little effort.</p>
<p>Whether you own event-driven, long-running services or deploy containerized jobs to process data, Google Cloud Run automatically scales your containers up and down from zero — this means you only pay when your code is running.</p>

		<p>Good security reporting is crucial to maintain a good security posture because it provides detailed insights into incidents. With this information, organizations can better understand vulnerabilities, improve defenses, and prevent similar threats in the future. At GitLab, the Security division has created use cases for GitLab Duo to improve reporting capabilities and enhance operational efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="gitlab-duos-security-capabilities">GitLab Duo’s security capabilities</h2>
<p>The GitLab Security division uses GitLab’s built-in incidents to manage and report on security incidents. Incidents are handled, documented, and resolved in GitLab, enabling the use of AI-driven GitLab Duo as an assistant when performing security operations like incident response.</p>
