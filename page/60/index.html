		<p>In the first part of Trustwave SpiderLabs’ Russia-Ukraine war blog series, we gave a brief look at our major findings as well as the main differences between how Russia and Ukraine wage attacks in the digital frontlines. In this part of our series, we shed light on how both countries target government entities, defense organizations, and even human targets as part of their overall strategy to win the war.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Two weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that the U.K. government had issued a secret order to Apple demanding that the company include a “backdoor” into the company’s end-to-end encrypted iCloud Backup feature. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The British government’s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. Its application would mark a significant defeat for tech companies in their decades-long battle to avoid being wielded as government tools against their users, the people said, speaking under the condition of anonymity to discuss legally and politically sensitive issues.</p>

Desktop email client Thunderbird announced a move to monthly releases by default earlier this year, allowing new users to benefit from new features, sooner – as the new Thunderbird 136.0 release makes evident! Thunderbird 136.0 sees messages auto-adapt to dark mode (and adds a quick toggle to control this in the header) — no more searing-white e-mail shocks in dark rooms! Also added is a new Appearance setting to control message threading and sorting order globally. This is great if you always want, say, new messages at the bottom in all your configured folders. Some notable fixes include ensuring that addresses […]</p>

		<p>Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) governance provides an extensible framework for enterprises to introduce their own security and configuration policies that can be applied to managed Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes clusters. For more information on RHACM policies, I recommend that you read the Applying Policy-Based Governance at Scale Using Templates and Comply to standards using policy based governance blogs.</p>
<p>In this 3-part series, I will showcase a number of techniques you can use for templates in your RHACM policies. In part one I reviewed practices you can use to make your templates more readable and easier to maintain. Part two of this series took a look at more advanced template functionality and extended use cases for using Policies to manage clusters.</p>

<p>The complexity of cloud environments means that there is a virtually infinite list of potential security risks and vulnerabilities that could arise within cloud infrastructure or workloads. That said, some cloud security threats are more prevalent than others – and knowing which risks and vulnerabilities are trending is key to knowing what to prioritize when managing the attack surface for your organization. To that end, this article details seven of the most prominent cloud threats and vulnerabilities that emerged in 2024, including several discovered by Aqua researchers.</p>
