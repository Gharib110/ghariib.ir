<p>I was fascinated by the idea of jet packs when I was a kid. They were sci-fi magic, and the idea that you could strap into an oversized backpack wrapped in tinfoil and fly around was very enticing. Better still was when I learned that these things weren’t powered by complicated rockets but by plain hydrogen peroxide, which violently decomposes into water and oxygen when it comes in contact with a metal like silver or platinum. Of course I ran right to the medicine cabinet to fetch a bottle of peroxide to drip on a spoon from my mother’s good silverware set. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed by the results.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump heads back to the White House, a University of Sussex professor who has been successfully predicting bitcoin (BTC) prices since 2021, is forecasting unprecedented highs which may breach $100k per token.</p>
<p>Prof Carol Alexander of the University of Sussex Business School says bitcoin’s rapid rise in the immediate wake of the US election is likely to continue before Trump’s inauguration on 20th January 2025. She also believes the lesser-known currencies ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE) will keep moving in the same direction, especially with the latter’s links to key Trump ally Elon Musk.</p>

	<div>
		<p>AI has rapidly become integral to business operations and shows no signs of slowing down. In a recent Red Hat survey, more than three quarters of respondents said preparing for AI adoption was a top driver for their cloud growth in 2025. This rapid growth of interest and adoption of AI technologies brings challenges. That same research showed that 71% of IT managers said AI was one of the top skills gaps they will have over the next 12-18 months that will likely limit their cloud adoption ambitions.As we look to the year ahead and even beyond, we must consider how we address some of those unde</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity isn’t just about technology—it’s about people. That’s why Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnered with the BBC to explore the human side of cybersecurity in our latest article, <em>The Human Side of Cybersecurity: Building a Culture of Security</em>, available on the BBC website.</p>
<p>In the piece, we spotlight the AWS Security Guardians program and how it helps security enable your business, not slow it down. Through the program, teams are provided tools, resources, and guidance to help address security concerns at every step of development. This enables developers to make the right decisions and embed security deeper in their solutions. Using our approach with their Security Champions initiative, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia shared how the program has helped transform their company culture and give ownership of services and security directly to their teams.</p>

		<p>This blog is an adaptation of a Red Hat research paper of the same name (Bestavros, Chen, Fox, Mollett Sidhpurwala, 2024). You may access the full paper here.As publicly available artificial intelligence (AI) models rapidly evolve, so do the potential security and safety implications, which calls for a greater understanding of their risks and vulnerabilities. To develop a foundation for standardized security, safety and transparency in the development and operation of AI models–as well as their open ecosystems and communities–we must change how we’re approaching current challenges, such</p>

		<p>The offices where Washington D.C.’s bureaucrats work were largely empty on Monday, January 20, 2025, as Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. President for the second time.</p>
<p>But they weren’t empty for the inauguration. Because that Monday coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day federal holiday, most U.S. government employees had a paid day off work.</p>
<p>But then, many of the federal government’s buildings continued to sit empty on Tuesday, January 21, and again on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Businesses are facing a significant challenge – security fragmentation and complexity are getting in the way of results. The IBM Institute for Business Value in collaboration with Palo Alto Networks conducted the study, <em>Capturing the cybersecurity dividend: how security platforms generate business value</em>. The research found 52% of surveyed executives identified complexity as the biggest impediment to their security operations. With the average organization managing 83 different security solutions from 29 vendors, the struggle to keep security operations streamlined and effective is real.</p>

		<p>The Azure DevOps Demo Generator is a tool that allows you to create projects in your Azure DevOps organization, complete with pre-filled sample content. This includes source code, work items, iterations, service connections, and build and release pipelines, all based on a template you select.</p>
<p>Starting <strong>February 28, 2025</strong>, we are eliminating the need for us to authenticate on your behalf. This update will give you greater control over creating new projects and ensure a more secure process. Instead of the previous authentication process, you will run the ADOGenerator project as a console application or executable (.exe) file to create projects in your Azure DevOps organization.</p>
