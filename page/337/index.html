<p>It’s been a big year for big data breaches. Billions of records on millions of people have been exposed at an estimated cost of nearly $10 trillion dollars to people and businesses alike worldwide.[i]</p>
<p>While we still have a few weeks in the year left to go, here’s a roundup of five of the most noteworthy breaches this year. And while you can’t prevent big data breaches from happening, you can still take several preventive steps to protect yourself from the fallout. We’ll cover them here too.</p>

		<p>With 2025 on the horizon, it’s important to reflect on the developments and various setbacks that happened in cybersecurity this past year. While there have been many improvements in security technologies and growing awareness of emerging cybersecurity threats, 2024 was also a hard reminder that the ongoing fight against cyber criminals is far from over.</p>
<p>We’ve summarized this past year’s top five data breach stories and industry trends, with key takeaways from each that organizations should note going into the following year.</p>

</p>
<p>In this research, we uncovered several vulnerabilities and security flaws within the Prometheus ecosystem. These findings span across three major areas: information disclosure, denial-of-service (DoS), and code execution.  We found that exposed Prometheus servers or exporters, often lacking proper authentication, allowed attackers to easily gather sensitive information, such as credentials and API keys.   </p>

<p>Despite initial interest in the 1990s and early 2000s, palmtop computers never really took off. Realistically most consumers were probably satisfied enough with smartphones as they became more widely available, but those of us who would prefer a real keyboard on our mobile devices are still feeling the pain. Today there are still a few commercial palmtop-like machines out there, but they aren’t exactly mainstream.</p>
<p>Which is why this 3D printed case for the Pixel 6 Pro from [TypingCat] is so interesting. It takes a relatively popular and capable contemporary phone, pairs it with a physical keyboard, and manages to create something that looks quite practical. Thanks to Termux, you can even get a fairly usable Linux environment going on the thing.</p>

		<p>The rapid adoption of cloud technology in the past few years has transformed IT environments, enabling unprecedented opportunities for flexibility, scalability, and collaboration. However, this transformation has introduced a potentially dangerous level of complexity into these environments – recent research from PwC revealed that 75% of executives report too much complexity in their organizations, leading to ‘concerning’ cyber and privacy risks. To navigate this complexity, modern organizations need security controls that keep pace with rapidly evolving IT environments. In this article, we’ll&hellip;</p>

		<p>Your main business is healthcare, so your excuse when you get hacked is that you didn’t have the budget to secure your network. Am I right?</p>
<p>So, in order to prevent a ransomware gang from infiltrating your network, you could just give them what they want—all your data.</p>
<p>The seemingly preferred method to accomplish this is to leave the information unprotected and unencrypted in an exposed Amazon S3 bucket.</p>
<p>An S3 bucket is like a virtual file folder in the cloud where you can store various types of data, such as text files, images, videos, and more. There is no limit to the amount of data you can store in an S3 bucket, and individual instances can be up to 5 TB in size.</p>

<p>Who’s getting excited? Next week, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s flagship conference, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, will kick off in Salt Lake City, Utah. In its ninth year, the conference has grown into more than just a technical conference—it’s a vibrant community event that offers attendees the tools, relationships, and inspiration to drive innovation in the cloud native ecosystem.</p>

<p>The miniature Christmas village is a tradition in many families — a tiny idyllic world filled happy people, shops, and of course, snow. It’s common to see various miniature buildings for sale around the holidays just for this purpose, and since LEDs are small and cheap, they’ll almost always have some switch on the bottom to light up the windows.</p>
<p>This year, [Braden Sunwold] and his wife started their own village with an eye towards making it a family tradition. But to his surprise, the scale lamp posts they bought to dot along their snowy main street were hollow and didn’t actually light up. Seeing it was up to him to save Christmas, [Braden] got to work adding LEDs to the otherwise inert lamps.</p>
