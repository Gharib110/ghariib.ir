		<p>Amazon Macie is a managed service that uses machine learning (ML) and deterministic pattern matching to help discover sensitive data that’s stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. Macie can detect sensitive data in many different formats, including commonly used compression and archive formats. However, Macie doesn’t support the discovery of sensitive data within images, audio, video, or other types of multimedia content. Customers often ask how to effectively detect whether there’s sensitive data in images. This can be a significant challenge for organizations, especially those operating in highly regulated industries with strict data protection requirements.</p>

	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Kubernetes is an open source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines. It’s become the go-to solution for orchestrating containers in production environments. But if you’re developing or testing locally, setting up a full Kubernetes cluster can be complex. That’s where Docker Desktop comes in — it lets you run Kubernetes directly on your local machine, making it easy to test microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized apps without needing a remote cluster.</p>

	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Virtual appliances (pre-configured virtual machine images ready to run on a hypervisor) have been commonly used for many years as a preferred mechanism to package and distribute applications. Virtual appliances eliminate the installation, configuration, and maintenance costs associated with running complex software stacks. </p>
<p>The Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) format is a standardized way to package and distribute virtual appliances. OVA files can be deployed across various virtualization platforms like VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, and more. An OVA file is basically an archive file, which includes an OVF file with all the metadata about the virtual appliance, and one or more virtual disk images. The Open Virtual Format file (OVF) within the OVA archive is basically an XML file with all the metadata needed by a virtualization platform to create virtual machines based on the OVA. Throughout this article we will use the LAMP OVA as an example. LAMP OVA is publicly available from Bitnami—a well known distributor of virtual appliances. Looking into the OVF inside this OVA, we can see the hardware requirements as well as some basic information about what&rsquo;s in the OVA (for readability, the file has been truncated and only XML elements for basic requirements are shown):</p>
