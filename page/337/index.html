		<p><strong>Streamline your Kubernetes networking with VPC-native DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters</strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce the general availability of VPC-native DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters! This new feature brings seamless integration between your DOKS clusters and VPC resources, enhancing networking flexibility and scalability for your workloads.</p>
<p><strong>What is a VPC-native DOKS cluster?</strong></p>
<p>VPC-native DOKS clusters enable native routing between Kubernetes clusters and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources. This means your DOKS clusters can operate as a natural extension of your existing VPC network architecture, allowing for streamlined connectivity and improved performance.</p>

		<p>Crowdstrike reported a 75% increase in cloud environment intrusions from 2022 to 2023 (source). IBM’s cost of data breach report shows that the global average cost of a data breach in 2024 is USD 4.88M, a 10% increase over last year and the highest total ever. Cyber attacks would scale much faster with the help of artificial intelligence. If organizations are not prepared, the consequences will be dire.</p>
<p>There are many security frameworks that can help organizations enable security and safety for their applications and users. In this blog post, we will discuss NIST CSF, one of the most used security frameworks that helps organizations understand and prevent cybersecurity risks. We will cover the key enhancements in NIST CSF 2.0 briefly, explain the primary components of CSF in detail, and show the best practices for maintaining NIST CSF in the cloud.</p>

		<p>While manual code review processes may suffice for a small team, as DevSecOps teams scale, the processes create significant bottlenecks that impede software development velocity and quality. Often slow, inconsistent, and frequently failing to catch critical vulnerabilities, the manual approach leads to technical debt and increased security risks.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks and drive innovation, organizations must prioritize automated code quality and compliance systems. The financial implications of poor code management are substantial, with technical debt consuming up to 40% of IT budgets (McKinsey Digital: Tech Debt Report) and software vulnerabilities costing an average of $4.88 million per security breach (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report).</p>

		<p>Enterprises are increasingly turning to Kubernetes for container orchestration, drawn by its promise of scalability, agility, and portability. While cloud-based Kubernetes solutions have gained traction, on-premises deployments remain a compelling option for organizations seeking greater control, security, and cost-efficiency. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2). Plus, we will configure MetalLB as a load balancer and integrate Rook-Ceph as a storage orchestrator for persistent storage.</p>

		<p>If you speak to teams or organizations running Kubernetes in production, one of the complaints you’ll often hear is how difficult multi-tenancy is. Organizations follow two approaches to share Kubernetes clusters with multiple tenants (multiple teams or people).</p>
<p>Those two approaches are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Namespace-based multi-tenancy</li>
<li>Cluster-based multi-tenancy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Namespace-based multi-tenancy:</strong></p>
<p>In namespace-based multi-tenancy, each team or tenant is restricted to a single namespace or a specific set of namespaces. The administrator is responsible for restricting access through RBAC. Once the team/tenant gains permissions they will be deploying their applications (pods) to these sets of namespaces. Though it appears simple and flawless, here are some of the drawbacks of this approach:</p>

		<p>DigitalOcean Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private networking solution that provides isolation for resources running on the DigitalOcean public cloud on isolated private networks. As of this writing, Droplets, DigitalOcean’s virtual machines, and Managed Databases products can run natively on VPC.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-digitalocean-vpc">What is DigitalOcean VPC?</h2>
<p>Over time there has been a growing need for secure networks, driven by the increase in digital footprints of online businesses, and greater needs for cloud mobility and ever increasing data breaches over networks. VPC provides a more secure, isolated, private IP network within the DigitalOcean cloud. Private networking of this form provides a strong security foundation with increased protection and privacy of data as it moves around within the DigitalOcean ecosystem isolated from the public internet.</p>

		<p>Have you ever used AI tools like ChatGPT to chat with a robot or Stable Diffusion to generate unique images? Wondered how they work?</p>
<p>Familiar apps, like the contacts app you use, use structured data, i.e., name, phone number, email address, and a few more text and numeric fields. While AI apps deal with different kinds of data that are unstructured. Some examples of unstructured data are articles, chats, pictures, multimedia, etc. These are quite complex for computer programs to process and understand the context.</p>

		<p>In recent years, we’ve witnessed two recurring trends: the release of increasingly powerful GPUs and the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions or trillions of parameters and expansive context windows. Many businesses are leveraging these LLMs by fine-tuning them or building out apps with domain-specific knowledge using RAG and deploying them on dedicated GPU servers. Now, when it comes to deploying these models on GPU, one thing to notice is the model size, i.e., the space required (for storing the parameters and context tokens) to load the model into the GPU memory is too high compared to the memory available on the GPU.</p>
