		<p>Cyber threats are more sophisticated, pervasive, and frequent than ever before. As a result, traditional methods for network security are becoming obsolete. These solutions simply cannot handle the extraordinary scale and complexity of network traffic inherent in modern IT environments. AI-driven solutions, however, can. How to Use AI for Network Security Modern networks generate a massive amount of data. Login attempts, device connections, data transfers, application access logs, and other such events contribute to massively complex environments. With so many events occurring simultaneously&hellip;</p>

	<div>
		<p>Imagine a seemingly minor misconfiguration in your cloud storage or an employee accidentally emailing a sensitive file to the wrong person. These incidents might seem trivial, but they can quickly snowball into a massive data breach, causing financial consequences. This scenario is a stark reminder of the importance of understanding and preventing data leaks. Data leaks are a threat to organizations, and developers can play a crucial role in preventing them. Understanding the causes and consequences of data leaks and implementing robust security measures can significantly reduce your&hellip;</p>

		<p>Apple has released security patches for most of its operating systems, including iOS, Mac, iPadOS, Safari, and visionOS.</p>
<p>To check if you’re using the latest software version, go to <strong>Settings</strong> (or <strong>System Settings</strong>) &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Software Update</strong>. It’s also worth turning on Automatic Updates if you haven’t already, which you can do on the same screen.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Remember when securing your network meant throwing up a firewall and calling it a day? Well, the cellular network industry has evolved, and so have the threats. A decade back, UScellular’s quest for IT security solutions ignited a long-standing partnership with Palo Alto Networks. Now, UScellular and Palo Alto Networks are teaming up once again to tackle the ever-growing security challenges of LTE, 5G and Gi-LAN networks.</p>
<p>What’s the twist? Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) go beyond the internet perimeter, providing comprehensive visibility and real-time threat mitigation for both UScellular’s high-capacity network interfaces and its customers. This isn’t just about throwing hardware at the issue. Palo Alto Networks leverages its innovative Zero Trust approach, a security framework that extends beyond the traditional network edge to bring best-in-class security to business- and mission-critical applications in 5G environments.</p>

If you’ve ever played around with customising Ubuntu (or any GNOME Shell-based Linux distribution) you’ll have encountered GNOME Tweaks, an official app giving you GUI access to options, settings, and controls not otherwise exposed in the UI. In recent years, GNOME’s developers have begun migrating settings out of GNOME Tweaks and into the desktop proper — a move which refutes that oft-opined claim that GNOME only removes options, never adds them. But we (as users) can’t expect GNOME to cover and cater to every whim, want and wish. It pulls engineers and developers away from working on arguably more important […]</p>
