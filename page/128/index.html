	<div>
		<p>Just days after we uncovered a campaign targeting Google Ads accounts, a similar attack has surfaced, this time aimed at Microsoft advertisers. These malicious ads, appearing on Google Search, are designed to steal the login information of users trying to access Microsoft’s advertising platform.</p>
<p>Microsoft does purchase ad space on its rival’s dominant search engine; however, we found Google sponsored results for “Microsoft Ads” (formerly known as Bing Ads) that contained malicious links created by impostors.</p>

		<p>We hardly knew ye.</p>
<p>Every so often, Microsoft will remove a pretty useful feature from one of its apps. Sometimes, they evaporate for seemingly no reason, and sometimes, the feature just wasn&rsquo;t seeing enough use to justify continuing its support. Today, we&rsquo;re seeing an example of the latter case: Microsoft has announced that it&rsquo;s sunsetting the Microsoft Defender VPN feature at the end of February. It&rsquo;s a move that&rsquo;s bound to prompt a lot of questions, including &ldquo;When on Earth did Microsoft Defender get a VPN feature?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>In this article, you’ll learn about the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) tool and how we take advantage of it to implement system and application monitoring for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.What is Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)PCP is an open source performance monitoring and analysis framework developed by Red Hat. It provides a suite of tools, libraries and services to monitor, retrieve and analyze performance metrics from different systems, services and applications. PCP is designed for scalability, enabling it to monitor anything from a single server to a large, distributed network of machi</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleHelp RMM that could allow for arbitrary code execution. SimpleHelp is a popular remote access software. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities when chained together could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>As internet security evolves, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates, cornerstones of encrypted communication, are stepping into a brand-new role as vital tools in the fight against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Experts are now leveraging <strong>SSL intelligence</strong> and historical SSL data to expose hidden threat actor infrastructure, track malware activity, and thwart potential cyber threats before they gain traction.</p>
