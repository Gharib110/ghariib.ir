		<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>WhatApp for Android retains contact info locally after contacts get deleted. This would allow an attacker with physical access to the device to check if the WhatsApp user had interactions with specific contacts, even though they have been deleted.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<p>When a contact is deleted on WhatsApp, their information about security code changes is retained (while the chat content is not). The only way to get rid of that is to select “Clear Chat” for the contact before deleting it. Even deleting the chat itself doesn’t do it unless the “Clear Chat” operation is done first. The “security code change notifications” option must be enabled in order for this to work.</p>

		<p>Facebook-owned social media platforms, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram are facing a worldwide outage, according to Downdetector, which offers real-time status and outage information for all kinds of services.</p>
<p>.https://d-31038805491725975734.ampproject.net/2109102127000/frame.html</p>
<p>Downdetector showed that WhatsApp outage was reported at 8:23 pm (Pakistan Standard Time) and it shot up to 1,082 complaints by 8:38 pm.</p>
<p>The website mentioned that the Instagram outage was reported first at 7:59 pm, while Facebook went down almost around the same time.</p>

		<p>When it comes to insider threats and cybersecurity in general, experts often discuss how to practice policies of containment, and use these to mitigate threats. One fundamental way to do this is through the process of network segmentation. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-network-segmentation">What is network segmentation?</h2>
<p>Network segmentation means that you essentially create smaller subnetworks linked to each other, so that you structure your network better, for a few key benefits. First, it’s easier to see network activity and monitor it within these smaller systems. Second, it can enhance performance across the network. Third, it promotes the use of a zero trust strategy.</p>

		<p>Well before arriving on campus, Peninah (Nina) Levine knew what she wanted from her undergraduate education:</p>
<p>“I came to MIT to be in an environment that would push me beyond my comfortable limits,” says Levine, a senior majoring in nuclear science and engineering (NSE). “I had to find where my passions lay and forge my own path.”</p>
<p>Today, Levine is well along that path, engaged in a five-year combined undergraduate and master’s program and helping develop technologies for characterizing nuclear material — tools to aid in nuclear weapons verification or to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear material. Her research is based in the Laboratory for Applied Nuclear Physics, directed by Associate Professor Areg Danagoulian.</p>

		<p>Chinese attackers have infiltrated more than a dozen US telecom providers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile to monitor US officials, and even politicians like Trump and Harris. The FBI detected this attack by Salt Typhoon months ago, but still can not get the attackers out of the systems. Now, America&rsquo;s Cyber Defence Agency (CISA) calls on everyone to use end-to-end encryption. This is proof that backdoors to encryption must never be allowed.</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity experts are raising concerns over a newly discovered vulnerability in Xerox printers that could potentially compromise sensitive information.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, which affects a variety of Xerox printer models, has the potential to allow unauthorized access to both the device and any data it handles. With businesses increasingly relying on digital solutions, this vulnerability poses a significant risk to organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was initially identified by cybersecurity researchers who discovered that the printers could be manipulated to bypass security protocols. Attackers could exploit this flaw to gain control over the printers and use them as a gateway to enter an organization’s internal network. This has left many businesses scrambling to implement countermeasures, as the printers are often linked to sensitive operations.</p>

</p>
<p>Whenever you’re surfing the internet, every click, search, and scroll leaves behind a small trace known as a digital footprint. While it might seem harmless to browse your favorite websites or interact on social media, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are monitoring and analyzing every digital action. These algorithms can build detailed profiles based on your online behavior, influencing everything from the ads to the content you view.</p>

		<p>NetBlocks metrics confirm the disruption of YouTube on multiple internet providers in Pakistan on Sunday 21 August 2022. The disruption comes as former Prime Minister Imran Khan makes a live broadcast to the public, despite a ban issued by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA).</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Real-time network data show the disruption in effect on some but not all mobile and fixed-line internet providers in Pakistan during the live-streamed speech. Access was restored after the speech concluded. The study is taken from a sample size of 100 measurements from 14 vantage points across Pakistan.</p>
