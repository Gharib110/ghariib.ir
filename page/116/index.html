<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 31, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 48 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Dumb Drop is a file upload application. Users with permission to upload to the service are able to exploit a path traversal vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary system files. As the container runs as root by default, there is no limit to what can be overwritten. With this, it&rsquo;s possible to inject malicious payloads into files ran on schedule or upon certain service actions. As the service is not required to run with authentication enabled, this may permit wholly unprivileged users root access. Otherwise, anybody with a PIN.<br>

<p>The post Cybersecurity researchers: Digital detectives in a connected world appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered yourself a detective at heart? Cybersecurity researchers are digital detectives, uncovering vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. To succeed, they adopt the mindset of an attacker, thinking creatively to predict and outmaneuver threats. Their expertise ensures the internet remains a safer place for everyone.</p>

		<p>The rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company, has not only disrupted the AI industry but also attracted the attention of cybercriminals.</p>
<p>As its AI Assistant app became the most downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in January 2025, surpassing OpenAI’s ChatGPT, malicious actors have exploited its popularity to launch phishing campaigns, investment scams, and malware attacks.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals have created fraudulent websites mimicking DeepSeek’s platform to target cryptocurrency users.</p>

		<p>If you’ve been following tech news in the last few days, you’ve heard of DeepSeek. This large language model (LLM) is threatening to disrupt current AI market leaders and fundamentally change the economics of AI-powered applications.</p>
<p>Released by a 200-person Chinese startup, the model appears as capable as state-of-the-art tools offered by OpenAI and Google with the benefit of being significantly faster and less expensive to run. What’s more, DeepSeek has been released to open source and is lightweight enough to run on commodity hardware – any developer can start tinkering with it without having to access costly GPUs. DeepSeek has been heralded as a “Sputnik moment” for AI and has sent shockwaves through financial markets.</p>

		<p>Next-gen frame generation technologies will unlock next-gen gaming sooner.</p>
<p>Nvidia hasn&rsquo;t been shy to talk gaming at 4K with its RTX 40 and RTX 50 series. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 was the most powerful GPU you could buy and the RTX 5090 has since taken that mantle. These graphics cards are great for enjoying all the latest games at 4K with ultra settings configured, though some titles would prove to be too much of a challenge for high frame rates. That&rsquo;s where Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) comes into play. There are various levels to this technology, but it works wonders for high-fidelity gaming and we could see 8K arrive sooner than we think.</p>
