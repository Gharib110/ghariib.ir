<p>The numbers are staggering: the average number of weekly cyber attacks per organization rose to 1,673 in 2024, a 44% increase compared to the previous year, according to Check Point’s The State of Cyber Security 2025 report. Among all sectors, education has been hit hardest, enduring a 75% year-over-year increase to a shocking 3,574 weekly attacks. Educational institutions have become prime targets for cyber criminals due to the wealth of personal information they manage. Most attacks originate from email (68%), with web-delivered attacks accounting for 32%, often involving malicious frameworks like FakeUpdates. The recent PowerSchool data breach illustrates the severe […]</p>

<p>Does cybersecurity have anything to do with corporate wellness? Absolutely. Stress and burnout aren’t just personal challenges—they’re security risks. Studies show that stressed employees are more likely to make mistakes, such as clicking on phishing links, reusing passwords, or bypassing security protocols for the sake of convenience. Resilient, confident employees, on the other hand, are critical to maintaining a secure organization.</p>

		<p>In the fast-moving world of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), everything seems to revolve around data. Entire careers are built around data. Data engineers, data analysts and data scientists are just a few roles that gather, synthesize, process, analyze and use data to help AI/ML solve real-world problems. As the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, the management of data becomes critical and a major challenge.Challenges in data managementData management brings many challenges in the AI/ML space, such as:Governance and compliance: Data governance often must meet</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will look at the privacy issues with some of LinkedIn’s external APIs. We will demonstrate how it is possible, with an email address, to find its associated LinkedIn profile. It is also possible from a LinkedIn profile to do the reverse path and find a person’s email address. To execute this deanonymization attack, documented features, like LinkedIn’s integration with Outlook and YahooMail, are used.</p>

<p>Did you know the word “<em>Cache</em>” comes from French and means “Hidden”?<br>
If we transpose it to IT we can see why it has been named as such: It is because of its nature.<br>
A concealed and faster memory part of a CPU used to overcome the bottleneck of a slower RAM externally connected via BUS.</p>
<p>In general, a caching algorithm has a predefined <em>set of primary keys</em> to be matched so that it will be able to retrieve or store data according to them.<br>
The use of cache techniques has been spreading over time along with technologies, resulting in features such as:</p>

<p>Cybercrime is draining resources from businesses and governments worldwide, and it is expected to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. To put it in perspective, if annual cybercrime were a country, it would have the third-largest gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide.</p>
