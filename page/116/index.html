		<p>Recently, a colleague shared a very personal experience his wife was about to face: she had been diagnosed with a heart condition and needed a pacemaker. Upon hearing the news, a slew of thoughts and questions ran through their minds. ‚ÄúHow will this affect daily life? How long will the device last? What type of pacemaker is best for this condition?‚Äù</p>
<p>And while speaking to doctors provided the peace of mind they needed, they quickly began extensive research, gathering insights from news articles, patient forums and health statistics. Considering recent reports on hackers targeting medical devices, they also had to take another important factor into consideration ‚Äì which manufacturer would provide the digital security they needed?</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>A typical Java or Kotlin programmer spends most of their productive time either creating application code in an editor or searching for bugs in a debugger. Occasionally, they might dive into a profiler when looking for places where the application spends too much time. However, they almost never venture into the Java C1 or C2 compilers and their resulting products ‚Äì low-level assembly code. For the most part, the Java compilers are black boxes that typically remain closed under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn‚Äôt. In this ‚Äòbehind closed doors‚Äô talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.</p>
<p>Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.</p>

<p>Smartphones, smart homes, and virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri have seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. Yet, many of us rarely stop to think about the technology behind them. We enjoy the convenience these devices offer, but behind the scenes, artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way we live, work, and interact with the world.</p>
<p>At first glance, AI-related terms like machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing might seem complex and almost like learning a new language. However, as AI becomes more common, understanding these concepts is becoming essential. But what exactly is AI, and how is it making an impact?</p>
