<p>In today’s rapidly evolving cyber landscape, malware threats continue to adapt, employing new tactics and leveraging popular platforms to reach unsuspecting victims. One such emerging threat is the <em>Lumma Stealer</em>—a potent information-stealing malware recently gaining traction through Telegram channels. With Telegram’s popularity as a messaging and sharing platform, threat actors have identified it as a lucrative distribution vector, bypassing traditional detection mechanisms and reaching a broad, often unsuspecting audience.</p>

		<p>December is a month of numbers, from holiday countdowns to RSVPs for parties. But for business leaders, the most important numbers this month are the budget numbers for 2025. With cybersecurity a top focus for many businesses in 2025, it is likely to be a top-line item on many budgets heading into the New Year.</p>
<p>Gartner expects that cybersecurity spending is expected to increase 15% in 2025, from $183.9 billion to $212 billion. Security services lead the way for the segment expecting the most spending growth, with security software coming in second and network security as the third area of growth.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>On December 15, we detected a malicious campaign targeting Kaiser Permanente employees via Google Search Ads. The fraudulent ad masquerades as the health care company’s HR portal used to check for benefits, download paystubs and other corporate related tasks.</p>
<p>We believe the threat actors’ intent was to phish KP employees for their login credentials, but something unexpected happened. Instead, victims who clicked on the ad were redirected to a compromised website that prompted them to update their browser.</p>
