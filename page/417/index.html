<p>In today’s rapidly evolving cyber landscape, malware threats continue to adapt, employing new tactics and leveraging popular platforms to reach unsuspecting victims. One such emerging threat is the <em>Lumma Stealer</em>—a potent information-stealing malware recently gaining traction through Telegram channels. With Telegram’s popularity as a messaging and sharing platform, threat actors have identified it as a lucrative distribution vector, bypassing traditional detection mechanisms and reaching a broad, often unsuspecting audience.</p>

		<p>December is a month of numbers, from holiday countdowns to RSVPs for parties. But for business leaders, the most important numbers this month are the budget numbers for 2025. With cybersecurity a top focus for many businesses in 2025, it is likely to be a top-line item on many budgets heading into the New Year.</p>
<p>Gartner expects that cybersecurity spending is expected to increase 15% in 2025, from $183.9 billion to $212 billion. Security services lead the way for the segment expecting the most spending growth, with security software coming in second and network security as the third area of growth.</p>

		<p>On December 15, we detected a malicious campaign targeting Kaiser Permanente employees via Google Search Ads. The fraudulent ad masquerades as the health care company’s HR portal used to check for benefits, download paystubs and other corporate related tasks.</p>
<p>We believe the threat actors’ intent was to phish KP employees for their login credentials, but something unexpected happened. Instead, victims who clicked on the ad were redirected to a compromised website that prompted them to update their browser.</p>

		<p>Mamont banker is distributed under the guise of an application for tracking the delivery of goods offered at wholesale prices.</p>
<p>We’ve discovered a new scheme of distribution of the Mamont (Russian for mammoth) Trojan banker. Scammers promise to deliver a certain product at wholesale prices that may be considered interesting to small businesses as well as private buyers, and offer to install an Android application to track the package. However, instead of a tracking utility, the victim installs a Trojan that can steal banking credentials, push notifications, and other financial information.</p>

	<div>
		<p>One of the hardest parts of managing an organization’s cybersecurity is patch management. Just as one patch cycle is completed, another set of patches are released. When compounded with the highly regulated energy industry, governed by the NERC CIP Standards, the task becomes even more daunting. Fortunately, Fortra’s Tripwire Enterprise (TE) and Tripwire State Analyzer (TSA) can ease the process. Some of the specified requirements align directly with the capabilities of TE, For example, the rationale section of CIP-010-4 R1 states that “the configuration change management processes are&hellip;</p>

		<p>In modern software development, businesses are searching for smarter ways to streamline workflows and deliver value faster. For developers, this means tackling challenges like collaboration and security head-on, while driving efficiency that contributes directly to business performance. But how do you address potential roadblocks before they become costly issues in production? The answer lies in optimizing the development inner loop — a core focus for the future of app development.</p>
