		<p>On November 29th, 2024, Black Friday, shoppers flooded online stores to grab the best deals of the year. But while consumers were busy filling their carts, cyber criminals were also seizing the opportunity to exploit the shopping frenzy. Our system detected a significant surge in Gozi malware activity, targeting financial institutions across North America.</p>
<h2 id="the-black-friday-connection">The Black Friday connection</h2>
<p>Black Friday creates an ideal environment for cyber criminals to thrive. The combination of skyrocketing transaction volumes, a surge in online activity and often lax security awareness among users provides fertile ground for launching attacks. Gozi malware, a well-known banking Trojan, exploits this seasonal chaos to target unsuspecting users and financial institutions alike.</p>

<p>In an organisation with many repositories and developers that are frequently shifting the maintenance of OWNERS and OWNERS_ALIASES files can be tedious. In the passing year a couple of functionalities has been added to help with this.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-aliases">Foreign aliases</h2>
<p>To avoid maintaining the OWNERS_ALIASES file in many repositories you can now refer to the OWNERS_ALIASES file in another repository. In the Jenkins X project we have the main OWNERS_ALIASES file in the jx-community repository. So in the jx repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file only looks like this:</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, I am Rajat Gupta, pursuing my bachelor‚Äôs in Information Technology. In 2022, I have been selected as a student developer in Google Summer of Code under Jenkins X. We will be building a new UI for Jenkins X. I got this news on May 20th, as I received an email from google.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-started">How I started</h2>
<p>The technologies needed were <strong>Golang</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and <strong>GitOps</strong>. I used golang only once before, while linting Jenkins X codebase, I only used Kubernetes once before while setting up a k3s cluster to run Jenkins X pipelines. These tasks were necessary to do for all GSoC participants. Apart from that, I was a total beginner.</p>

<p>It is a web application built with Golang for the backend and Sveltekit for the frontend, both of which are built together and used in the same container. To function properly, it must be installed as a helm chart with Jenkins X CRDs.</p>
<p>üåü It has light and dark themes.</p>

<p>A good UI is essential for a CI/CD tool, as not everyone is familiar with the CLI. The current UI (jx-pipeline-visualizer) is a read-only UI, the user can view the logs of PipelineActivity but neither can start nor stop the pipeline.</p>

		<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>Supply chain security is a rising concern in the current software era. Securing the software supply chain encompasses vulnerability remediation and the implementation of controls throughout the software development process. Due to massive increase in attacks on software supply chain and the diversity of its types, Jenkins X has to make efforts to ensure that the build process is secure. As part of securing Jenkins X installation by default I worked on both securing our own components and enabling our users to use these features in their build and release steps..</p>

		<p>We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year! Hacktoberfest is a month-long global celebration of open source software.</p>
<p>All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate in Hacktoberfest and join a global community of open source contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Learn more about Hacktoberfest and sign up here.</strong></p>
<h3 id="contribute-to-jenkins-x">Contribute to Jenkins X</h3>
<p>We welcome your contributions to the Jenkins X project!</p>
<p>Issues labelled ‚Äúhacktoberfest‚Äù generally indicate good first issues. However, all pull requests will count towards your Hacktoberfest challenge.</p>

<p>A standard part of the Jenkins X pipelines since a long time is the execution of <code>jx changelog create</code> that takes the commit messages between the release currently being created and the previous one and creates a change log from these. The change log is then stored as a release note in GitHub or other git provider.</p>
<p>During the last year some improvements have landed in various Jenkins X components to improve the changelogs and their usefulness. So I‚Äôll take this opportunity to describe these improvements and also in general give hints to how to get useful changelogs.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries, tools, and processes used in those stages.</p>

	<div>
		<p>To allow Jenkins X to support Kubernetes 1.22, we had to update our version of Tekton. This updated version of Tekton contains breaking changes that has consequences if you made your own custom Jenkins X pipelines.</p>
<p>To make sure that your custom pipelines continue to work after this upgrade, you must edit the resource settings in your pipelines. Otherwise your pipelines will most likely not be able to start at all, or if they do, consume a lot of resources.</p>
