<p>Kali Linux 2.0 has been out for a couple of months and the response has been great, with well <strong>over a million unique downloads of Kali 2.0</strong> as a testament. Release day was somewhat hectic for us, as we did not anticipate the sheer volume of traffic … which we somehow always underestimate. In the first few days after the release of 2.0, we had <strong>ten times</strong> the download volume of 1.0 in a similar period, back in 2013.</p>

<p>After immersing myself for years and years in the world of finance (specifically, options market making and algorithmic trading), there was no escaping this mantra of “no risk, no reward.” Most of the time, my (trading) style was fairly risk-averse. I knew how to find the signals of opportunities among the daily noise to reap small rewards. Fortunately, I also learned how to think about the outliers and to take the occasional big but calculated risks.</p>

<p>We’re still buzzing and recovering from the Black Hat and DEF CON conferences where we finished presenting our new [Kali Linux Dojo](](/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/), which was a blast. With the help of <strong>a few good people</strong>, the Dojo rooms were set up ready for the masses - where many <strong>generated their very own Kali 2.0 ISOs for the first time</strong>. But the excitement doesn’t end for us just yet. With the end of the cons, we now find ourselves smack in the middle of <strong>the most significant release of Kali since 2013</strong>. Today is the day that Kali 2.0 is officially released.</p>

In the past few months we’ve been working feverishly on our next generation of Kali Linux and we’re really happy with how it’s looking so far. There’s a lot of new features and interesting new aspects to this updated version, however we’ll keep our mouths shut until we’re done with the release. We won’t leave you completely hanging though…here’s a small teaser of things to come!</p>

<p>It’s 2015, and the end of the road for encrypted SMS/MMS in TextSecure.</p>
<p>The TextSecure story started back in 2009, at the dawn of the smartphone era. Back then, TextSecure focused on securing the transport that everyone coming from feature phones was familiar with: SMS. Today, many things have changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the “TextSecure transport,” which uses data rather than SMS. While we remain committed to supporting <em>plaintext</em> SMS/MMS in addition to the encrypted TextSecure transport so that the app can function as a unified messenger, we are beginning the process of phasing out support for SMS/MMS as an <em>encrypted</em> transport in favor of the TextSecure data protocol.</p>
