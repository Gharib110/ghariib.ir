<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two popular options have recently emerged for building an AI application based on large language models (LLMs): LlamaIndex and LangChain. Deciding which one to use can be challenging, so this article aims to explain the differences between them in simple terms.</p>
<p><a href="/community/tutorials/local-ai-agents-with-langgraph-and-ollama">LangChain</a> is a versatile framework designed for building various applications, not just those confined to large language models. It offers tools for loading, processing, and indexing data and interacting with <a href="/community/tutorials/llm-for-social-media-analytics">LLMs</a>. LangChain’s flexibility allows users to customize their applications based on the specific needs of their datasets. This makes it an excellent choice for creating general-purpose applications that require extensive integration with other software and systems.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, a growing interest has been in testing the adversarial robustness of natural language processing (NLP) models. The research in this area covers new techniques for generating adversarial examples and defending against them. Comparing these attacks directly is challenging because they are evaluated on different data and victim models.</p>

<p>Vision-language models are among the advanced artificial intelligence AI systems designed to understand and process visual and textual data together. These models are known to combine the capabilities of computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The models are trained to interpret images and generate descriptions about the image, enabling a range of applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image synthesis. These models are trained on large datasets and powerful neural network architectures, which helps the models to learn complex relationships. This, in turn, allows the models to perform the desired tasks. This advanced system opens up possibilities for human-computer interaction and the development of intelligent systems that can communicate similarly to humans.</p>

<p>Security experts have uncovered a novel Strela Stealer campaign, which leverages a new iteration of email credential-stealing malware. In this campaign, the updated malware version is enriched with enhanced functionality and is now capable of gathering system configuration data via the “system info” utility. Moreover, Strela Stealer expanded its targets beyond Spain, Italy, and Germany […]</p>
