<p>We have really enjoyed doing the <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/kali-linux.html"><strong>Dojo at Black Hat</strong></a> the last few years. It’s been a great opportunity to show off some of the lesser known (but oh so useful) <a href="https://www.kali.org/features/">features of Kali Linux</a> as well as interact with the user base. But one of the limitations of the previous structure was that while this was a hands-on exercise, many attendees moved at different paces from each other. So we wanted to move towards more of a “self service” model where <strong>attendees can drop in, have access to the training material, and will be free to work at their own pace</strong>. We accomplished with the new model we will be premiering this year, allowing everyone to take as much, or as little, time needed to get a working Kali install customized to their desires. While this is being done, <strong>Kali developers will be onsite and interacting with everyone</strong> on a consistent basis.</p>

<p>The folks at <strong>Black Hat</strong> have been kind enough to invite us once again to deliver a <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/kali-linux.html">Kali Dojo in Las Vegas</a> this year. The event will be held on the <strong>4th of August at the Mandalay Bay</strong> hotel, and will be open to all Black Hat pass types. This year our Dojo will be set up differently, allowing for a larger crowd and much more interaction. We are going to hold a full day event, featuring several main activity areas :</p>

<p><em>At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been developing open source “consumer-facing” software for the past four years. We want to share some of the things we’ve learned while doing it.</em></p>
<p>As a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers. Unlike software, when they create something, it is really done — forever. A recorded album can be just the same 20 years later, but software has to change.</p>
