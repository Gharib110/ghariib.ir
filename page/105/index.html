		<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start with the reality</strong></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept—it’s here, and it’s transforming the way we work across multiple industries. From automating mundane tasks to enhancing decision-making, AI is a game-changer for productivity. Yet, despite its potential, many professionals are still lagging behind, failing to leverage AI to its fullest. This article will explore how you can 10x your productivity with AI, the untapped opportunities it presents, and 50 AI tools that can revolutionize your workflow.</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The rapid growth of AI applications across industries has led to significant changes, particularly with the adoption of deep learning and generative AI, which provide a competitive advantage in industries such as drug discovery in pharmaceutical R&amp;D and fraud detection in banking and e-commerce.</p>
<p>However, these advancements require substantial infrastructure that on-premises solutions often fail to support due to high initial costs, inflexible resources, inefficient GPU management and the rapid evolution of GPU hardware technologies. Additionally, increasing data requirements and the need for global availability complicate the ability to meet the dynamic demands of modern AI workloads.</p>

<p>Writing and deploying security threat detections in an organization’s security information event management platform (SIEM) is a critical component of a successful cybersecurity program. Moving from manual detection engineering to a fully automated process by implementing Detections as Code (DaC) ensures detection consistency, quality, auditing, and automated testing. At GitLab, we’ve embedded DaC capabilities into GUARD, our fully automated detection and response framework.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-13767<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 31, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1 day ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Live2DWebCanvas plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ClearFiles() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.1 | HIGH<br>

		<p>DigitalOcean has recently launched VPC peering GA, enabling private network connectivity between VPC Networks. This release unlocks some major customer requests including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ability to connect VPCs within and across data centers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VPC Native DigitalOcean Kubernetes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VPC peering for DBaaS (MySQL, Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, Vector DB)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this technical deep dive, we’ll explore the architecture, implementation details, and key considerations behind this new feature.</p>
<h2 id="vpc-peering-architecture-overview">VPC Peering Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>The VPC peering implementation leverages the existing VPC building blocks as described in the VPC: Behind the Scenes blog. On top of that, we built a new L3 routing component to enable routing between different VPC networks. This architecture enables transit of different kinds of networks and hence we named it as the Transit Gateway. The core routing software on the HV is enabled by Open vSwitch (OVS). OvS provides the capability to express the VPC datapath with OpenFlow specification.</p>

		<p>The Department of Justice is investigating a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil for hacking the phones of climate activists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm, according to a lawyer representing the U.S. government. The firm, in turn, was allegedly working on behalf of one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not name either company&hellip;</p>
