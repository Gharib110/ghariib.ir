<h2 id="generative-ai-is-evolvingis-your-security-strategy-keeping-pace"><strong>Generative AI is Evolving—Is Your Security Strategy Keeping Pace?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Generative AI</strong> has quickly become a pivotal element in <strong>digital transformation</strong> across industries, driving automation, enhancing customer interactions, and accelerating software development. But with these advancements come new and complex security challenges. Companies are rushing to adopt <strong>generative AI</strong> to stay competitive, yet many haven’t adapted their cybersecurity practices to handle the emerging threats. When companies designed their cybersecurity policies and controls, few, if any, had generative AI on their bingo card. As a result, we’re seeing organisations unprepared for the unique vulnerabilities this technology introduces.</p>

<p>The use of ChatGPT has led to a decrease in human-generated content with people asking and answering fewer questions online, according to new research from Corvinus University of Budapest.</p>
<p>Content and discussions online are used by people to learn new things and solve problems, and essential for training AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Johannes Wachs, Associate Professor at Corvinus University, and colleagues from UCL and LMU Munich investigated the impact of ChatGPT on the generation of open data on Stack Overflow, an online Q&amp;A platform for computer programmers and an essential source of training data for LLMs.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Always by Your Side: Constructing Traceable Anonymous Credentials with Hardware-Binding</strong><br>
<em>Chang Chen, Guoyu Yang, Qi Chen, Wei Wang, Jin Li</em></p>
<p>With the development of decentralized identity (DID), anonymous credential (AC) technology, as well as its traceability, is receiving more and more attention. Most works introduce a trusted party (regulator) that holds a decryption key or backdoor to directly deanonymize the user identity of anonymous authentication. While some cryptographic primitives can help regulators handle complex tracing tasks among large amounts of user profiles (stored by the issuer) and authentication records (stored by the service provider), additional security primitives are still needed to ensure the privacy of other users. Besides, hardware-binding anonymous credential (hbAC) systems have been proposed to prevent credential sharing or address platform resource constraints, the traceability of hbAC has yet to be discussed.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>AWS launched AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) in August 2011 with a single global endpoint <code>(https://sts.amazonaws.com)</code>, hosted in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. To reduce dependency on a single Region, STS launched AWS STS Regional endpoints (<code>https://sts.{Region_identifier}.{partition_domain}</code>) in February 2015. These Regional endpoints allow you to use STS in the same Region as your workloads, which improves both performance and reliability.</p>
<p>However, many customers and third-party tools continue to call the STS global endpoint, and as a result, these customers don’t get the benefits of STS Regional endpoints. To help improve the resiliency and performance of your applications, we are making changes to the STS global endpoint, with no action required from customers. These changes will be released in the coming weeks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Asynchronous YOSO a la Paillier</strong><br>
<em>Ivan Bjerre Damgård, Simon Holmgaard Kamp, Julian Loss, Jesper Buus Nielsen</em></p>
<p>We present the first complete asynchronous MPC protocols for the YOSO (You Speak Only Once) setting. Our protocols rely on threshold additively homomorphic Paillier encryption and are adaptively secure. We rely on the paradigm of Blum et al. (TCC `20) in order to recursively refresh the setup needed for running future steps of YOSO MPC, but replace any use of heavy primitives such as threshold fully homomorphic encryption in their protocol with more efficient alternatives. In order to obtain an efficient YOSO MPC protocol, we also revisit the consensus layer upon which our protocol is built. To this end, we present a novel total-order broadcast protocol with subquadratic communication complexity in the total number $M$ of parties in the network and whose complexity is optimal in the message length. This improves on recent work of Banghale et al. (ASIACRYPT `22) by giving a simplified and more efficient broadcast extension protocol for the asynchronous setting that avoids the use of cryptographic accumulators.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>If your API security isn’t airtight, your entire operation is a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>Why? Well, hackers aren&rsquo;t guessing passwords; they’re exploiting weak authentication and wide-open authorization doors (which are some of the most common functions of APIs).</p>
<p>This is where you either tighten your defenses or become vulnerable. Mastering authentication and authorization isn&rsquo;t optional—it’s survival. This guide explains how to lock down your APIs, protect user data, and keep your systems bulletproof in a world where digital threats never sleep.</p>

	<div>
		<p>AWS Firewall Manager is a powerful tool that organizations can use to define common AWS WAF rules with centralized security policies. These policies specify which accounts and resources are in scope. Firewall Manager creates a web access control list (web ACL) that adheres to the organization’s policy requirements and associates it with the in-scope resources. Figure 1 shows a Firewall Manager security policy and web ACL created in each in-scope account.</p>
