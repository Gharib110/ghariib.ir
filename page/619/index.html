<p>It’s 2023 and we’re all a little older, including ATT&amp;CK, which will be celebrating its 8th (!) release anniversary in a few short months. Last year we matured, expanded, deconflicted, and renovated the knowledge base, persevering through challenges to meet our 2022 goals. Some of our most notable efforts including unveiling Enterprise structured detections, publishing Mobile sub-techniques, introducing ICS detections, transitioning ATT&amp;CK for ICS to the mothership (aka attack.mitre.org), launching Campaigns, and hosting ATT&amp;CKcon 3.0.</p>

		<p>The 8220 hacker group is known for targeting both Windows and Linux web servers by deploying “crypto-jacking” malware to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This group reportedly has access to the source code of these OSs, which enhances their ability to carry out attacks via brute force and RCE.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity researchers at Sekoia recently discovered that the 8220 hacker group recently added two important tools to their arsenal, and the tools are “Hadooken” and “K4Spreader.”</p>

		<p>Wouldn’t it be wonderful to wake up one day with a desire to explore AI and machine learning, only to find a well-crafted, simple, and beginner-friendly tutorial that covers all of the crucial core elements you need to build your very first model? Well, you’ve come to  the right place!</p>
<p>The goal of this guide is to show you how to develop a model capable of classifying different species of Iris flowers based on their characteristics, such as sepal length and petal width. This will help you to learn the fundamentals of building and deploying machine learning models, which will serve you well in more complex projects down the line. In this guide, we will walk through how to build a model to solve the Iris Classifier problem, a famous classification example in the machine learning community.</p>

<p>2023 was dynamic year for ATT&amp;CK. We marked a decade of progress since the framework’s inception and achieved some key milestones to make ATT&amp;CK more accessible for a wider community. Our scope (slightly) expanded to encompass activities adjacent to direct Enterprise interactions, such as non-technical, deceptive practices and social engineering techniques (Financial Theft, Impersonation, and Spearphishing Voice). We enhanced detection capabilities with integrated notes, pseudocode from CAR, and BZAR-based analytics. The ICS matrix welcomed the addition of Assets to enhance inter-sector communication and mapping. We rolled out Mobile-specific data sources, structured detections, and behaviors like smishing, quishing, and vishing. Website navigation was improved, along with a faster Search bar, and updates that hit you faster than you can say “resources/changelog.html”. We also maintained a steady cadence of updates and new content from the ATT&amp;CK team and external contributors.</p>

<p>Right on cue, ATT&amp;CK’s latest release is out, and this time we’ve gone to v11! If you’ve been following along with our roadmap there shouldn’t be any huge surprises in store, but we wanted to take a chance to go over our latest changes. The v11 set list includes detections now paired with related Data Sources: Data Components, a beta version of sub-techniques for ATT&amp;CK for Mobile, ATT&amp;CK for ICS on attack.mitre.org, as well as regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, and Groups.</p>

<p>It’s not like a regular Tuesday, it’s a lucky Tuesday — ATT&amp;CK v13 has arrived. As we outlined in our Roadmap, we’re working toward enhanced tools for lower-resourced defenders, improving ATT&amp;CK’s website usability, enhancing ICS and Mobile parity with Enterprise, and evolving overall content and structure this year. ATT&amp;CK v13 is bringing some analytics pseudocode, Mobile-specific data sources, key website updates, ICS Asset refactoring, and more Cloud and Linux coverage. For the rest of our regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our release notes, our (new) detailed changelog, or our (new) changelog.json.</p>
