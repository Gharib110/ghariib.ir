		<p>Air-gapped environments are computer networks or systems that are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public internet or unsecured local area networks. This isolation is implemented as a security measure to protect sensitive data and critical systems from external cyber threats by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced security: By physically isolating systems from external networks, air-gapped environments help prevent remote attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized data access. This is crucial for highly sensitive data and critical systems.</li>
<li>Data protection: Air-gapping provides the strongest protection against data exfiltration since there&rsquo;s no direct connection that attackers could use to steal information.</li>
<li>Critical infrastructure protection: For systems that control vital infrastructure (like power plants, water treatment facilities, or military systems), air-gapping helps prevent potentially catastrophic cyber attacks.</li>
<li>Compliance requirements: Many regulatory frameworks require air-gapping for certain types of sensitive data or critical systems, particularly in government, healthcare, and financial sectors.</li>
<li>Malware protection: Without network connectivity, systems are protected from network-based malware infections and ransomware attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though air-gapped systems are isolated, they can still have vulnerabilities. Regular security scanning helps identify these weaknesses before they can be exploited. In this article, you will learn the different security scanners GitLab provides and how they can be added/updated in a limited-connectivity environment.</p>

</p>
<p>The recentÂ UK Home Office proposalÂ designed to hinder and disrupt ransomware operations through several proposed measures, including a targeted ban on ransomware payments, has again brought this question into the public square. The question of whether to pay a ransom demand is a decades-long argument with ardent opinions on both sides.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Having served our country in the cyberranks of the first Trump Administration, we know how important it is for the second Trump Administration to hit the ground running in its cyber defense mission. As recent events have reinforced, our cyber adversaries â€“ China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and beyond â€“ arenâ€™t sitting on their hands.</p>
<p>We are confident that the incoming national security and cybersecurity team is ready to forcefully counter adversarial cyber activity from foreign nation-states; fight the proliferation of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and other U.S. businesses; protect American intellectual property; and embrace AI innovation as a critical enabler of cyber resilience. These are all goals the entire nation can rally around.</p>

		<p>These console games all deserve remastering for the PC</p>
<p>While console and PC gaming have evolved side by side for decades, some big franchises have not made the transition to the other platform. That&rsquo;s especially true for the early years of the console wars, and while you could emulate those classic consoles and play the games in their original state, I&rsquo;m all for these classics getting the remaster or reboot treatment so they can come to the PC with the benefits of new graphics technology.</p>

	<div>
		<p>OLED monitors are excellent, but they&rsquo;re far from perfect</p>
<p>OLED monitors have become very popular in the last couple of years, especially among gamers, due to all the advantages they offer over traditional LCD panels. I&rsquo;ve owned multiple OLED monitors since 2022, with the Alienware AW3423DW being my very first one. As much as I enjoyed using them, these monitors aren&rsquo;t flawless.</p>

		<p>You need visibility on what&rsquo;s going on in your home lab at all times.</p>
<p>As you expand your self-hosted services and home lab with new and varied projects, managing things like uptime and storage space can quickly become a pain. SSHing into individual servers or apps can be a pain, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have a centralized dashboard where you could see, at a glance, the health of your home lab and its services?</p>

		<p>Three open source experts offer their advice on sharing open source projects with the world.</p>
<p>The post 5 tips for promoting your open source project appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>After months or years of hard work, youâ€™ve just pushed your open source project to GitHub and made it public. Now itâ€™s time to tell the world about it.</p>
<p>Chances are youâ€™d rather spend time writing code than getting the word out about your project. Maybe your project will go viral and you wonâ€™t have to spend much time on marketing. But chances are youâ€™re going to need to do some work to build awareness, at least in the early days. Fortunately, there are plenty of people who have been down this path and are willing to help. In this article, experienced maintainers offer their advice on sharing open source projects with the world.</p>
