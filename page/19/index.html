	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Cloud applications and the infrastructure and workloads that power them are mission critical. Today’s organizations need more than the “good enough” visibility offered by lightweight agents. Reliable cloud security leaves nothing to chance — not when an attack can quickly turn into a breach. Organizations need cloud runtime protection that stops threats in real time.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-with-modern-cloud-attacks">Challenges with Modern Cloud Attacks</h2>
<p>As cloud adoption has skyrocketed, adversaries have followed. Up to 80% of security exposures start in the cloud, with 45% of risks changing every month, making them moving targets. Not only do misconfigurations give attackers a direct path to critical resources, but they also enable lateral movement — and often without triggering alarms. Defending the cloud becomes more challenging by the day.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In 2024, we announced Log Explorer, giving customers the ability to store and query their HTTP and security event logs natively within the Cloudflare network. Today, we are excited to announce that Log Explorer now supports logs from our Zero Trust product suite. In addition, customers can create custom dashboards to monitor suspicious or unusual activity.</p>
<p>Every day, Cloudflare detects and protects customers against billions of threats, including DDoS attacks, bots, web application exploits, and more. SOC analysts, who are charged with keeping their companies safe from the growing spectre of Internet threats, may want to investigate these threats to gain additional insights on attacker behavior and protect against future attacks. Log Explorer, by collecting logs from various Cloudflare products, provides a single starting point for investigations. As a result, analysts can avoid forwarding logs to other tools, maximizing productivity and minimizing costs. Further, analysts can monitor signals specific to their organizations using custom dashboards.</p>

		<p>AI is transforming businesses — from automated agents performing background workflows, to improved search, to easier access and summarization of knowledge. </p>
<p>While we are still early in what is likely going to be a substantial shift in how the world operates, two things are clear: the Internet, and how we interact with it, will change, and the boundaries of security and data privacy have never been more difficult to trace, making security an important topic in this shift.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and the availability of accessible developer tools have made it relatively easy to incorporate sophisticated AI capabilities into applications. In the past two years, we’ve seen countless AI-powered applications launched. At the same time, developers have been discovering how to enhance existing software with conversational interfaces, predictive analytics, automated customer support, and similar features.</p>
<p>The AI boom caught many by surprise, and standards and regulations have taken a while to catch up. But things are now changing. While the establishment of a regulatory landscape looms, industry standards, spearheaded by the EU AI Act, are moving forward to lead the way.</p>
