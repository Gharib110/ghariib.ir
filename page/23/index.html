<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 3, 2025</p>
<p>Today’s security teams are tasked with managing an increasingly intricate web of responsibilities. These range from ensuring compliance and continuous security testing, resilience to integrating security protocols, and managing a growing array of devices—from IoT ecosystems to remote work setups. This complexity often overwhelms even the most experienced teams.</p>

		<p>Today, we announced our commitment to achieving the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) - High, Australian Infosec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP), and Spain’s Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS) as part of Cloudflare for Government. As more and more essential services are being shifted to the Internet, ensuring that governments and regulated industries have industry standard tools is critical for ensuring their uptime, reliability and performance.</p>
<h2 id="what-sets-cloudflare-for-government-apart">What sets Cloudflare for Government apart?</h2>
<p>Cloudflare’s network spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with approximately 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. Our network is our greatest strength to provide resiliency, security, and performance. So instead of creating a siloed government network that has limited access to our products and services, we decided to build the unique government compliance capabilities directly into our platform from the very beginning. We accomplished this by delivering critical controls in three key areas: traffic processing, management, and metadata storage.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In December 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed limited activity by an unattributed threat actor using a publicly available, static ASP.NET machine key to inject malicious code and deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework. In the course of investigating, remediating, and building protections against this activity, we observed an insecure practice whereby developers have incorporated various publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys from publicly accessible resources, such as code documentation and repositories, which threat actors have used to perform malicious actions on target servers.</p>

<p>Soon after the launch of AI models DeepSeek and Qwen, Check Point Research witnessed cyber criminals quickly shifting from ChatGPT to these new platforms to develop malicious content. Threat actors are sharing how to manipulate the models and show uncensored content, ultimately allowing hackers and criminals to use AI to create malicious content. Called jailbreaking, there are many methods to remove censors from AI models. However, we now see in-depth guides to jailbreaking methods, bypassing anti-fraud protections, and developing malware itself. This blog delves into how threat actors leverage these advanced models to develop harmful content, manipulate AI functionalities through […]</p>
