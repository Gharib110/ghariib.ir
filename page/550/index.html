<p>At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been working on improving our encrypted asynchronous chat protocol for TextSecure. The TextSecure protocol was originally a derivative of <a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html">OTR</a>, with minor changes to accommodate it for transports with constraints like SMS or Push. Some of the recent changes we’ve made include <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability">simplifying and improving OTR’s deniability</a>, as well as creating a <a href="/blog/asynchronous-security">key exchange mechanism for asynchronous transports</a>. Our most recent change incorporates what we believe to be substantial improvements to OTR’s forward secrecy “ratchet.”</p>

<p>At Open Whisper Systems, we’re focused on creating easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology. Our projects are free, Open Source, and tend to be oriented around the mobile environment. We’ve been working on apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">TextSecure</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone">RedPhone</a> (which provide secure text messages and secure phone calls) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed secure communication tools that are both privacy-preserving <em>and</em> a joy to use.</p>

<p>My cell phone used to be a black and white Nokia until a couple of weeks ago when I decided to enter in the smartphone world. Now that there are more mobile devices connected to the internet than computers, I think it’s time for me as well to discover the possibilities of this technology. During this few weeks I’ve been playing with my new toy, checking how to secure it, and seeing what free software is around to use cryptography on it.</p>

<p>Getting Kali Linux to run on ARM hardware has been a major goal for us since day one. So far, we’ve built <strong>native</strong> images for the Samsung Chromebook, Odroid U2, Raspberry Pi, RK3306, Galaxy Note 10.1, CuBox, Efika MX, and BeagleBone Black to name a few. This however does not mean you cannot install Kali Linux in a chroot on almost any modern device that runs Android. In fact, the developers of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy&amp;hl=en">Linux Deploy</a> have made it extremely easy to get any number of Linux distributions installed in a chroot environment using a simple GUI builder.</p>

<p>A little while back, a bug with the LVM encrypted install in Kali Linux 1.0.4 was <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=443">reported</a> in our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/submitting-issues-kali-bug-tracker/">bug tracker</a>. This bug was high priority in our TODO as encrypted installs are an important feature in our industry so we wanted to squash this bug ASAP. This article will describe the process of debugging, identifying, and fixing this bug in Kali, and ultimately in Debian as well.</p>

<p>Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for cryptographic security. These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their outgoing message with that public key.</p>
