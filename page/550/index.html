<p>Spring Break of Code 2013 I cut open my foot and hand while surfing; both wounds easily warranted stitches. Winter Break of Code 2014 I banged the top of my foot surfing over some coral; the cuts were sealed within minutes. Spring Break of Code 2013 I struggled with the Android SDK, while Winter Break of Code 2014 I caught myself taking a few too many short-cuts. On day zero nothing is easy, but over time you improve, spilling a little less blood every time.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code, Day Six</em></p>
<p>A lot of great memories will stay with me after this intense week. The house surrounded by palm trees, people with computers in every corner, laying down on a sofa, chatting on the balcony, and sitting down on the carpet. The surf and hiking breaks on this astonishing Kauai’s landscape, sharp mountains covered by forests falling into beaches of fine sand and fun waves. The nights spiced with Moxie’s tasty cocktails and long deep conversations about the meaning of life, the internet and everything.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code, Day Three</em></p>
<p>We are at the halfway point of Winter Break of Code. We have two homes near the beach shared by 12 people. 10 of us are working on the apps &amp; website and 2 are leading up delicious dinner efforts. We’ve spent time on the beach, in the ocean, in the mountains, and of course working. Concepts for future startups and tactics about self-publishing books are brewing, and conversations are lined with politics and activism. Work sessions are focused on making cryptography usable in existing Android apps and soon-to-be-released iPhone apps.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code, Day Two</em></p>
<p>By all rights, I should not be here. My application was last-minute to say the least, and little more than a casual note that I’d be down to reprise my role from SBoC as web hacker for whispersystems.org. Maybe it was because of my work in the previous months on tweaking the site layout to be responsive, or because <a href="https://www.twitter.com/bcrypt">@bcrypt</a> (who is infinitely more qualified) was too dedicated to her work at the EFF to take the time off, or because my birthday happened to fall on this week, but for one reason or another, the universe smiled, and here I am.</p>
