<p>Some time ago in 2016 I backed a Kickstarter for the <a href="https://onion.io/omega2/">Omega2</a> board. This is a tiny Linux powered computer meant for IoT development. I had plans to make cool things with it at the time, but the reality of it was that the Omega2+ ended up in my closet to be forgotten. Fast forward to 2020, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, I’m on vacation looking for things to do, and now seemed like a good time to put the Omega2+ to use.</p>
