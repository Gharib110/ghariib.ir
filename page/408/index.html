<p>AWS is aware of CVE-2022-1471 in SnakeYaml software, included in DynamoDB local jar and Docker distributions from version 1.21 and version 2.0. If leveraged, this issue could allow an actor to perform remote code execution using the SnakeYaml&rsquo;s Constructor(), as the software does not restrict the types that can be instantiated during deserialization. AWS has found no evidence that this issue has been leveraged, however, customers should still take action. On November 6, 2024, we released a fix for this issue. Customers should upgrade DynamoDB local to the latest version: v1.25.1 and above, or 2.5.3 and above.</p>

<p>A security researcher recently reported an issue with AWS’s recently-released (November 16th, 2022) support for multiple multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices for IAM user principals. The reported issue could have potentially arisen only when the following three conditions were met: (1) An IAM user had possession of long-term access key (AK)/secret key (SK) credentials, (2) that IAM user had the privilege to add an MFA to their own identity without using an MFA, and (3) that IAM user’s overall access privileges beyond console sign-in had been configured by an administrator to be greater after adding the MFA. Under those narrow conditions, possession of AK/SK alone was equivalent to possession of AK/SK and a previously configured MFA.</p>

		<p>A year ago, I was introduced to image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). That introduction brought me back together with some folks I’d worked with in Project Atomic, and it proved that you could orchestrate the complete build and automation of an operating system using application pipelines. Finally, sysadmins can take advantage of the same build tools developers have.Image mode for RHEL enables you to use container tools to assemble operating system artifacts. GitHub happens to have all the required tooling: source control, a built-in container registry and pipeline tools in the for</p>

Removing backgrounds from video in Kdenlive, the free, open-source video editor for Linux, macOS and Windows, is about to get a whole lot easier. Developers are adding a “modern background removal tool” that uses machine learning to create object masks so you can ‘cut out’ an object, person, or item in a video clip. Real-time background removal features are common in video conferencing/chat apps like Slack. They allow a user to replace their actual backdrop (like a messy kitchen) with an alternative image or, sometimes, even a video clip. And image editing tools like GIMP and Photoshop have long been […]</p>
