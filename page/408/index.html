		<p><strong>This message from Sid Sijbrandij and Bill Staples was shared with GitLab team members earlier today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sid:</strong> On today’s earnings call, I announced that I am stepping down as CEO and will remain Executive Chair of the Board. I also introduced GitLab’s new CEO, Bill Staples.</p>
<p>As a Board, we routinely do succession planning. This includes conversations with a number of top executives. We’ve been having these conversations in greater earnest since my cancer returned. Through these discussions, we identified someone uniquely qualified to lead GitLab. I want more time to focus on my cancer treatment and health. My treatments are going well, my cancer is not metastatic, and I&rsquo;m working towards making a full recovery. Stepping down from a role that I love is not easy, but I believe that it is the right decision for GitLab.</p>

		<p>Optimizing GPU utilization is essential in modern computing, particularly for AI and ML processing, where GPUs play a pivotal role due to their unparalleled ability to handle parallel computations and process large datasets rapidly. Modern GPUs are invaluable in these fields. They have thousands of cores that enable very high parallelism. This enables complex model training and real-time data analysis that are impractical with traditional CPUs.</p>
<p>By fully utilizing GPU resources, organizations can accelerate MLOps workflows, achieve faster insights, and enhance the efficiency of their computing infrastructure. This leads to significant cost savings by reducing the need for additional hardware and operational expenses, while also improving scalability and flexibility to meet the dynamic demands of contemporary computational tasks. One key method for optimizing GPU utilization is by sharing the GPUs among different workloads. This is where virtual GPU (vGPU), Multi-Instance GPUs (MIG) and GPU Time-Slicing come to our rescue!</p>

		<p>GitLab is continuously translated by our global community of translators and proofreaders. Through Crowdin, they help make our product more accessible to the world by translating it into 78 languages. GitLab translation community members are volunteer translators, working professionals who are GitLab users, and even university students contributing to translators as part of their classroom projects.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-gitlab-open-core-model-supports-translators">How the GitLab open-core model supports translators</h3>
<p>While this community collaboration is powerful, translators often face a crucial challenge: understanding the full context of the text that they are translating.</p>

		<p>Writing PHP application code and ensuring the application is running smoothly in production are often two different skills sets owned by two different engineers. GitLab aims to bridge the gap by enabling the engineer who has written the PHP application code to also deploy it into Google Cloud Platform with little effort.</p>
<p>Whether you own event-driven, long-running services or deploy containerized jobs to process data, Google Cloud Run automatically scales your containers up and down from zero — this means you only pay when your code is running.</p>

		<p>Good security reporting is crucial to maintain a good security posture because it provides detailed insights into incidents. With this information, organizations can better understand vulnerabilities, improve defenses, and prevent similar threats in the future. At GitLab, the Security division has created use cases for GitLab Duo to improve reporting capabilities and enhance operational efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="gitlab-duos-security-capabilities">GitLab Duo’s security capabilities</h2>
<p>The GitLab Security division uses GitLab’s built-in incidents to manage and report on security incidents. Incidents are handled, documented, and resolved in GitLab, enabling the use of AI-driven GitLab Duo as an assistant when performing security operations like incident response.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In our previous post, we talked about creating an AI agent for technical communities that can use the conversation history amongst colleagues and other members to answer the user’s common questions. InSightful is the agent we built that uses the Reasoning and Action (ReAct) approach to respond to user queries accurately. However, during the retrieval process the generalization of the retrieved information causes the agent to provide a high-level overview of the information. You can greatly improve the results of the retrieved information from the conversation history within a community by retrieving relevant <strong>specific</strong> information according to a query. This can be achieved with a reranker.</p>

		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming industries, from automotive to finance. Since the advent of using GPUs for AI/ML workloads in the last few years, processing large amounts of data has become significantly faster. Workload orchestrators like Kubernetes have also played an important role in maximizing GPU compute power.</p>
<p>However, one of the critical bottlenecks in this process is often the networking infrastructure. AI/ML training and inference workloads require the rapid and reliable transfer of massive datasets. Even the most powerful GPUs can be underutilized without an optimized networking setup, leading to significant delays and inefficiencies.</p>
