<p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence is transforming cybersecurity, offering unprecedented opportunities to defend against increasingly complex and automated threats. AI is no longer a support tool—it’s emerging as a central pillar of modern security strategies. From detecting anomalies and automating threat responses to augmenting security teams, AI is enabling defenders to act faster, scale their operations, and outpace attackers. However, as the technology advances, significant challenges remain, from adversarial AI to the cultural inertia of legacy systems.</p>

<p>Advanced Intuit Password Recovery received a major overhaul, adding support for Intuit QuickBooks 2024. For QuickBooks’ annual update, we are excited to provide the complete solution for safe, instant, unconditional password removal. This enhancement addresses a persistent issue in earlier versions, making user management more reliable and efficient for users, IT professionals, and digital forensic specialists.</p>
<h2 id="the-tool">The Tool</h2>
<p>The tool we’re talking about is Advanced Intuit Password Recovery, a lightweight computer forensic product designed to recover lost or forgotten passwords for Intuit Quicken and QuickBooks files. It supports a wide range of Quicken versions from 2006 through 2022 and QuickBooks versions from 2006 through 2023 (and now also 2024), including many international and localized variants. For breaking Quicken passwords, the software is equipped with advanced hardware acceleration, utilizing last-generation NVIDIA video cards to speed up the password recovery process, while QuickBook passwords are subject to instant removal. It can unlock password-protected Quicken .QDF and QuickBooks .QBW files, making it an essential tool for IT professionals managing financial data.</p>

		<p>Insurance company Allstate and its subsidiary Arity unlawfully collected, used, and sold data about the location and movement of Texans’ cell phones through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.</p>
<p>Attorney General Paxton says the companies didn’t give consumers notice or get their consent, which violates Texas’ new Data Privacy and Security Act.</p>
<p>Arity would pay app developers to incorporate software that tracks consumers’ driving data in their apps. When consumers installed these apps they unwittingly downloaded that software, which allowed Arity to monitor the consumer’s location and movement in real-time.</p>

<p>In the latest update of Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery (EDPR), we’ve introduced a revamped load-balancing feature. The new feature aims to enhance resource utilization on local workstations across diverse hardware configurations. This update has drastically reduced the time required to break passwords in certain hardware configurations, thanks to a refined load distribution algorithm. In this article, we’ll share some technical details on how load balancing leverages a mix of GPUs and CPU cores.</p>

		<p>Many organizations use Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization to manage and deploy virtualized workloads alongside containerized ones on the same unified OpenShift platform. For those prioritizing virtualization, Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine, a new edition of OpenShift, provides a dedicated option focused entirely on virtualization workloads. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling virtual machines by removing non-virtualization capabilities that they may not currently need. This targeted approach ensures teams can maximize the value of OpenShift Virtualization while</p>

<p>Before I start, I would like to mention that I have made some corrections to the previous blog post, based on feedback by tool developers. Also, most of them have confirmed to me that they are working on improving their parsing capabilities, based on this blog series. I am happy to support them in that direction!</p>

		<p>I am finally back with the third blog post in the series!</p>
<p>Before I introduce this new post, I want to point out some updates to the previous blog post. </p>
<p>I have corrected a couple of errors related to the Belkasoft tool, in particular the device UDID and the device phone number.</p>
<p>Also, after the blog post, Alexis Brignoni released some new iLEAPP parsers that cover most of the “red” boxes and MSAB confirmed to me that they have already fixed all the “red” boxes from the previous blog post. At the end of the series, I will re-process the dataset with the latest version of the various tools, and create a separate table with the updated comparison.</p>
