<p>Cybersecurity researchers have found that bad actors are continuing to have success by spoofing sender email addresses as part of various malspam campaigns.</p>
<p>Faking the sender address of an email is widely seen as an attempt to make the digital missive more legitimate and get past security mechanisms that could otherwise flag it as malicious.</p>
<p>While there are safeguards such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) that can be used to prevent spammers from spoofing well-known domains, such measures have increasingly led them to leverage old, neglected domains in their operations.</p>

		<p>Back in March I was fortunate to spend several days visiting Brussels, where I had a chance to attend a panel on “chat control“: the new content scanning regime being considered by the EU Commission. Among various requirements, this proposed legislation would mandate that <em>client-side scanning</em> technology be incorporated into encrypted text messaging applications like Signal, WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. The scanning tech would examine private messages for certain types of illicit content, including child sexual abuse media (known as CSAM), along with a broad category of textual conversations that constitute “grooming behavior.”</p>

<p>In this paper, we study the distribution of the textit{gap} between terms in an addition chain. In particular, we show that if $1,2,ldots,s_{delta(n)}=n$ is an addition chain of length $delta(n)$ leading to $n$, then $$underset{1leq lleq delta(n)}{mathrm{sup}}(s_{l+k}-s_l)gg kfrac{n}{delta(n)}$$ and $$underset{1leq lleq delta(n)}{mathrm{inf}}(s_{l+k}-s_l)ll kfrac{n}{delta(n)}$$ for fixed $kgeq 1$.</p>

<p>What can a forensic expert find in an Outlook data file? Can they recover deleted emails, contacts and appointments from Microsoft Outlook? Can users erase unwanted correspondence from Outlook? In this article, we’ll demonstrate how experts can recover valuable information from Outlook data files (PST/OST), including deleted emails, contacts, attachments, and appointments. Even when users attempt to erase unwanted correspondence, traces often remain within the database. With the right tools, experts can extract and analyze this hidden data to uncover critical evidence.</p>

<p>Our blog features numerous articles on breaking passwords and accessing encrypted data, ranging from simple “how-to” guides to comprehensive manuals. However, many of the questions we are frequently asked are not about the technical stuff but rather the very basics of password recovery. Can you break that password? Is it legal? How much time do you think it will take to break this one? We do have the answers, but they require digging through the extensive content of our blog. To address this, we’ve created a comprehensive A to Z article that not only answers many common questions but also links to our previous posts.</p>

		<p>Learn how to distinguish a fraudulent site from a real one.</p>
<p>Whenever you’re asked to log in to an online service, verify your identity, or download a document through a link, you’re usually required to enter your username and password. This is so common that most of us do it automatically without thinking twice. However, scammers can trick you into giving them passwords for your email, government service websites, banking services, or social networks by mimicking the service’s login form on their own (third-party) website. Don’t fall for it: only the email service itself can ask to verify your email password — no one else! The same applies to government services, banks, and social networks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Pre-sieve, Partial-guess, and Accurate estimation: Full-round Related-key Impossible Boomerang Attack on ARADI</strong><br>
<em>Xichao Hu, Lin Jiao</em></p>
<p>The impossible boomerang attack is a very powerful attack, and the existing results show that it is more effective than the impossible differential attack in the related-key scenario. However, in the current key recovery process, the details of a block cipher are ignored, only fixed keys are pre-guessed, and the time complexity of the early abort technique is roughly estimated. These limitations are obstacles to the broader application of impossible boomerang attack. In this paper, we propose the pre-sieving technique, partial pre-guess key technique and precise complexity evaluation technique. For the pre-sieving technique, we capitalize on the specific features of both the linear layer and the nonlinear layer to expeditiously filter out the impossible quartets at the earliest possible stage. Regarding the partial pre-guess key technique, we are able to selectively determine the keys that require guessing according to our requirements. Moreover, the precise complexity evaluation technique empowers us to explicitly compute the complexity associated with each step of the attack. We integrate these techniques and utilize them to launch an attack on ARADI, which is a low-latency block cipher proposed by the NSA (National Security Agency) in 2024 for the purpose of memory encryption. Eventually, we achieve the first full-round attack with a data complexity of $2^{130}$, a time complexity of $2^{254.81}$, and a memory complexity of $2^{252.14}$. None of the previous key recovery methods have been able to attain such an outcome, thereby demonstrating the high efficacy of our new technique.</p>
