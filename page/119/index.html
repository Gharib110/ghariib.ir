		<p>Do these practices to make PowerShell even more efficient.</p>
<p>PowerShell is a handy tool for troubleshooting network issues, automating tasks, managing configurations, or building solutions. But if you&rsquo;re just starting out, it might feel a bit tricky to get the hang of. We’ll discuss some tips to help you get the most out of PowerShell and write scripts that are effective and easy to tweak and reuse in different situations. Like English spelling and grammar rules, PowerShell best practices and style guidelines almost always have exceptions. Still, we’ll discuss a baseline for command design, programming, and formatting to help you avoid common problems.</p>

<p>As we step into 2025, the cyber security landscape continues to be as complex as ever for security leaders looking to protect their organizations from increasingly injurious cyber threats. The World Economic Forum (WEF) detailed some of the most challenging threats in its Global Cyber security Outlook 2025, with some critical areas of concern mirroring those in our own State of Cyber security Report 2025. Both reports emphasize the growing sophistication of cyber threats, the integration of emerging technologies to make cyber threats harder to detect and deter, and the outsized influence of global geopolitical factors influencing cyber security threats.

<p>While tech-savvy people are very concerned about privacy, knowing where to find metadata leaks can be nebulous even for developers. In this blog post, we will explore examples of unexpected user information leakage. We hope that the information shared in this blog will help developers assess and address potential privacy issues with their applications, as well as educate end-users about potential risks to their privacy that can result from information leaks.</p>

		<p>Save our (con)soles</p>
<p>All my gamer friends have been celebrating ever since Valve announced that they would allow users to install SteamOS on any gaming handheld out there. Understandably so, since SteamOS has a bunch of advantages that can change the world of PC gaming. From being lighter on the internals to allowing users to fire up a game via a custom launcher quickly, SteamOS has quickly established itself as the better alternative to unoptimized Windows 11 builds running on most handhelds on the market. It&rsquo;s also a big reason why the Steam Deck OLED is the best PC gaming handheld at the moment.</p>

		<p>If you want to ditch File Explorer, you can&rsquo;t do much better than Directory Opus. Here are a few reasons why.</p>
<p>The Windows File Explorer is an iconic part of that operating system, and it&rsquo;s been around for a very long time. However, it&rsquo;s far from perfect, and many power users have found that turning to third-party solutions is a better option.</p>

<p>If you are testing the security of WordPress websites, you will likely have to look at the REST endpoints. By default, users can be listed with the route “/wp-json/wp/v2/users”. On the latest WordPress version, out of the box, you will get the username and the hashed email. Experienced WordPress administrators and users are aware of the potential disclosure. Therefore, we can see various tutorials online on how to hide this information. The recommended ways are either to disable the REST API completely,<br>
install a security plugin which disables the specific route or block specific request paths.</p>

	<div>
		<p>A patch is available for a vulnerability in 7-Zip that could have allowed attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) security feature in Windows.</p>
<p>The MotW is an attribute added to files by Windows when they have been sourced from an untrusted location, like the internet or a restricted zone. The MotW is what triggers warnings that opening or running such files could lead to potentially dangerous behavior, including installing malware on their devices. 7-Zip added support for MotW in June 2022.</p>
