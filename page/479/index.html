		<p>**Publication Date: 2024/10/21 4:00 PM PDT<br>
**</p>
<p>The AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio repo provides an OIDC authentication mechanism that was integrated into the open source Kubeflow project. The adapter uses JWT for authentication, but lacks proper signer and issuer validation. In deployments of ALB that ignore security best practices, where ALB targets are directly exposed to internet traffic, an actor can provide a JWT signed by an untrusted entity in order to spoof OIDC-federated sessions and successfully bypass authentication.</p>
