		<p>Researchers have discovered a new attack named <strong>SysBumps</strong>, which targets macOS systems running on Apple Silicon processors. This attack leverages speculative execution vulnerabilities in system calls to bypass critical security measures such as <strong>Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR)</strong> and kernel isolation. KASLR, a crucial defense mechanism, randomizes the memory layout of the kernel, making it harder for attackers to predict the location of specific functions or data structures. By breaking KASLR, attackers can more easily exploit other vulnerabilities, significantly compromising macOS system security.</p>

Developers create unit tests to validate the behavior of individual components, isolating them from external dependencies such as file systems, databases, message brokers, and third-party APIs. However, since many applications rely on these external components, developers write integration tests to ensure an application interacts correctly with its dependencies in a more complete environment.</p>

<p>Time flies. Only a year ago, we saw the release of Scala 3.4.0-RC1, and now we’re trying out Scala 3.6.2 with many new experimental features. The last 12 months have brought many new features to the IntelliJ Scala Plugin as well. A year ago we introduced X-Ray mode, which lets you easily augment the code you see in the editor with information about inferred types and other details. We’ve improved Scala 3 support, compiler-based highlighting, and the debugger. We’ve improved auto-completion, both the standard and the AI-powered versions. We’ve introduced support for named tuples, which are still an experimental feature, and we’ve implemented a new way to work with sbt projects. On top of all that, this year, JetBrains joined the Scala Advisory Board. You can read about those changes in our release notes and other blog posts:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We made it – this far! The U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently published the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, marking the end of the beginning of the journey to quantum resiliency. In this blog post, we will briefly recap how we arrived at this point, take a quick look at the standardized algorithms, and point out a few areas of future work and challenges.</p>
