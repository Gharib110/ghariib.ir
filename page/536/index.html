<p>In an earlier post, we covered <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/advanced-package-management-in-kali-linux/">Package Management in Kali Linux</a>. With the ease of installation that APT provides, we have the choice amongst tens of thousands of packages but the downside is, we have tens of thousands of packages. Finding out what packages are available and finding the one(s) we want can be a daunting task, particularly for newcomers to Linux. In this post, we will cover three utilities that can be used to search through the haystack and help you take advantage of the vast Open-source ecosystem.</p>

For Windows 10 users, this means you can simply enable WSL, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kali-linux/9pkr34tncv07">search for Kali</a> in the Windows store, and install it with a single click. This is especially exciting news for penetration testers and security professionals who have limited toolsets due to enterprise compliance standards.</p>

<p>I had an awesome time presenting a workshop on an introduction to Linux binary exploitation at Defcon Toronto. As part of the workshop, I sent attendees home with a challenge binary called vuln03 to be solved at their own time using the information they learned. vuln03 came with a SUID root version called rootme that would pop a rootshell if correctly exploited. This is a writeup on how to reverse engineer this binary and figure out how to exploit it. If you’re stuck trying to solve it, or if you’ve solved it and just want to compare notes, keep reading!</p>

<p>Long before we knew that it would be called Signal, we knew what we wanted it to be. Instead of teaching the rest of the world cryptography, we wanted to see if we could develop cryptography that worked for the rest of the world. At the time, the industry consensus was largely that encryption and cryptography would remain unusable, but we started Signal with the idea that private communication could be simple.</p>
