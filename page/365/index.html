		<p>What is Behavioral AI and how does it work? What makes it superior to the old EPP and EDR solutions in protecting the enterprise from today&rsquo;s threats?</p>
<p>The post Verhaltensbasierte KI: Der uneingeschr√§nkte Schutzansatz f√ºr Unternehmen appeared first on SentinelOne DE.</p>
<p>Einem CISO wird klar, dass sein Unternehmen Schlagzeilen macht.</p>
<p>Es sind keine positiven Schlagzeilen, sondern Schlagzeilen dar√ºber, dass die Daten des Unternehmens auf ‚ÄûPastebin‚Äú ver√∂ffentlicht wurden. Dieser Albtraum ist schon h√§ufig Realit√§t geworden, beispielsweise in Singapur. Hier wurden 2018 die Krankenakten von 1,5¬†Millionen B√ºrgerinnen und B√ºrgern¬†‚Äì unter ihnen auch Premierminister Lee Hsien Loong¬†‚Äì von Hackern gestohlen.</p>

<p>It sounds easy - &ldquo;just verify people&rsquo;s age before they access the service&rdquo; - but whether we&rsquo;re talking about porn in the US or Australia&rsquo;s incoming social media laws, the reality is <em>way</em> more complex than that. There&rsquo;s no unified approach across jurisdictions and even within a single country like Australia, the closest we&rsquo;ve got to that is a government scheme usually intended for accessing public services. And even if there <em>was</em> a technically workable model, who wants to get either the gov or some big tech firm involved in their use of Instagram or Pornhub?! There&rsquo;s a <em>social</em> acceptance to be considered and not only that, circumvention of age controls is <em>very</em> easy when you can simply VPN into another jurisdiction and access the same website blocked in your locale. Or in the case of the adult material, I&rsquo;m told (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) there are many other legally operating websites in other parts of the world that are less inclined to block individuals in specific states from foreign countries. There&rsquo;ll be no easy solutions for this one, but it&rsquo;ll make for an entertaining year üòä</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/what-are-computer-worms/">What Are Computer Worms?</a></h1>
	<b><time>06.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In today&rsquo;s interconnected digital world, businesses are constantly under threat from cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and devices. One of the most persistent and silent threats that organizations face is computer worms. These malicious programs can spread across networks, infecting systems autonomously and wreaking havoc before a user even realizes something is wrong.</p>
<p>Computer worms are a type of malware designed to replicate themselves and spread autonomously across networks and computer systems. Unlike traditional viruses that require user action to propagate, computer worms can self-replicate without needing to attach to a host file or program. This unique capability makes them especially dangerous, as they can spread rapidly and infect numerous devices before users are even aware of their presence. The impact of computer worms can range from reduced system performance to the complete loss of critical data. High-profile attacks, such as those by the infamous Code Red and WannaCry worms, have highlighted how severe and disruptive these threats can be.</p>

	<b><time>06.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, threats continue to become more sophisticated and pervasive. Among various cyber threats, brute force attacks stand out due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Despite being a basic form of attack, they remain a significant threat to businesses. This blog aims to demystify brute force attacks, explore their various forms, and offer actionable insights on how to safeguard your organization against them.</p>
<h2 id="brute-force-attack-definition">Brute Force Attack Definition</h2>
<p>A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or encrypted data. By systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords or encryption keys, attackers want to eventually stumble upon the correct one. The brute force definition emphasizes persistence and computing power over cunning or stealth, making it a straightforward yet powerful tactic.</p>

		<h2 id="what-is-a-cyberattack">What is a cyberattack?</h2>
<p>Cyberattacks aim to damage or gain control or access to important documents and systems within a business or personal computer network.</p>
<p>Cyberattacks are distributed by individuals or organizations for political, criminal, or personal intentions to destroy or gain access to classified information.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of cyberattacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Malware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phishing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL injection attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Botnets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ransomware</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using reliable software and a solid cyber strategy can lower the chances of a business or personal database being affected by a cyberattack.</p>

	<b><time>06.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The term ‚Äúmalicious software‚Äù is shortened to ‚Äúmalware.‚Äù Malware is invasive software that is purposefully created to harm computers and computer networks. On the other hand, software that unintentionally causes harm is typically called a software bug.</p>
<p>Occasionally, inquiries are made regarding the distinction between malware and viruses. The distinction is that ransomware, which encompasses various online threats such as viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware, is referred to as malware. To put it simply, one kind of malware is a computer virus.</p>

		<p>The process of protecting networks, computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, and data from malicious attacks is known as cybersecurity. It is also referred to as electronic information security or information technology security. The term can be categorized into a few common categories and is used in various contexts, including business and mobile computing.</p>
<p>The process of safeguarding a computer network against trespassers, be they malevolent actors or malicious software, is known as network security.</p>

		<p>Security information and event management, SIEM for short, is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations.</p>
<p>SIEM, pronounced ‚Äúsim,‚Äù combines both security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into one security management system. SIEM technology collects event log data from a range of sources, identifies activity that deviates from the norm with real-time analysis, and takes appropriate action.</p>
