		<p>Data is not just a strategic asset. It’s the lifeblood of your organization. Losing access to any strategic asset can threaten an organization’s viability; without plants and equipment, manufacturers would find it difficult to succeed, and service providers can’t operate without brand recognition. Similarly, without data, your organization could be left in a state of complete and utter paralysis, unable to function or recover. </p>
<p>Like the security of other strategic assets, data loss prevention is not a reactive measure but a critical function that organizations must proactively address. By taking the initiative and implementing effective data loss prevention strategies, you can assert control over your data’s security and ensure the continuity of your operations.</p>

		<p>One could call 2024 the year of growth for Tuta! From the launch of post-quantum cryptography for email, to a completely new look and feel with a beautiful new website, to an encrypted calendar app for Android and iOS, to the opening of our second office, 2024 has been packed with exciting developments. We’d like to give a big thank you to all of you who support our fight for privacy. None of our achievements and growth would have been possible without you!</p>

		<p><em>Areg Danagoulian, associate professor in the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, has built a career around nuclear detection technology. His work has focused, among other things, on a system that could greatly improve the current process for verifying compliance of nuclear warheads.</em></p>
<p><em>Earlier this year, he published new work on physical cryptographic nuclear warhead verification and on active detection of shielded nuclear materials in journals including</em> Nature Communications <em>and the</em> Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. <em>He has also received a pair of prestigious accolades: a radiation science and technology award from the American Nuclear Society and the honor of being named, along with his team, as the 2019 Arms Control Association (ACA) Arms Control Persons of the Year.</em> <em>“This innovation paves the way for more effective arms control agreements, inspections, and enforcement,&quot; said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the ACA. &ldquo;Professor Danagoulian’s MIT team has brought the best science to arms control and provided a creative solution that can reduce nuclear threats and enhance security.”</em></p>

		<p><em>Ron Rivest is an MIT Institute Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He’s an authority on algorithms and an inventor of the RSA public-key cryptosystem, one of the most widely used algorithms to securely transmit data. Since the 1980s, he’s taught students how to use cryptography to help secure voting systems. Then, in 2000, an historic recount in Florida determined the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, and the Caltech / MIT Voting Technology Project was founded with the mission to secure future elections, pulling in Rivest, who has been involved since, as well as other MIT faculty from the Department of Political Science and the MIT Sloan School of Management.</em></p>

	<div>
		<p>Dolby Vision offers various technological advantages over other HDR formats, and is the one best positioned for future displays.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new smart TV or projector, you&rsquo;ll be parsing through a mountain of specs and terms that you may not be all that familiar with. Among them is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and its various standards. Two of the most common formats you&rsquo;ll see listed are Dolby Vision and HDR10.</p>

		<p>You might want to ride this year out if you don&rsquo;t need an immediate upgrade.</p>
<p>CES 2025 is almost here, and we&rsquo;re expecting Nvidia to unveil the RTX 5000 series, AMD to show us what the next generation of Radeon GPUs will be called, and a bunch of other PC hardware that&rsquo;ll be ripe for upgrading to this year. It should be a wonderful time with the future of PC gaming on display with everything consumers will be able to buy later on in stores. But this year isn&rsquo;t normal, and really, no technology release for a while has.</p>

		<p>The costs associated with insider threats continued to rise in 2022. </p>
<p>This is bad news for organizations that are already under financial pressure from the uncertainty of the economy. As interest rates continue to climb and customers become more conservative about how they spend, the last thing that any organization needs is to be putting out fires from security incidents coming from arsonists inside their own house.  </p>
<p>And yet, a variety of factors, not the least of which are sizable layoffs hitting companies and the fluidity of access to data, make the possibility of an insider threat increasingly likely. </p>

		<p>In today’s digital-first world, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face cybersecurity challenges that grow more complex by the day. SMBs are prime targets for attackers hoping to gain a foothold inside any organization that doesn’t have extensive security measures. As threats increase, so does the need for comprehensive, reliable, and accessible protection.</p>
<p>This is where managed detection and response (MDR) services come in. MDR combines threat detection, investigation, and response, offering businesses the support from a team of security experts who monitor the environment 24/7 to identify and respond to threats. For many SMBs, MDR is an ideal solution because it provides a level of protection and expertise that would otherwise require building an in-house security operations center (SOC).</p>
