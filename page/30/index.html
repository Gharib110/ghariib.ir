		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Wiretapping LLMs: Network Side-Channel Attacks on Interactive LLM Services</strong><br>
<em>Mahdi Soleimani, Grace Jia, In Gim, Seung-seob Lee, Anurag Khandelwal</em></p>
<p>Recent server-side optimizations like speculative decoding significantly enhance the interactivity and resource efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) services. However, we show that these optimizations inadvertently introduce new side-channel vulnerabilities through network packet timing and size variations that tend to be input-dependent. Network adversaries can leverage these side channels to learn sensitive information contained in emph{encrypted} user prompts to and responses from public LLM services.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The cyber threat to critical infrastructure has never been greater. The growing sophistication of cybercriminals, deteriorating geopolitical relations, and the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) have created unprecedented risks for critical infrastructure organizations. Fortunately, resources are available to help these organizations protect themselves. In late October 2024, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) released Zero Trust Guidance for Critical Infrastructure, a systematic, five-step roadmap to help the world&rsquo;s most important organizations&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="what-is-docker-bake">What is Docker Bake?</h2>
<p>Docker Bake is an orchestration tool that streamlines Docker builds, similar to how Compose simplifies managing runtime environments. With Bake, you can define build stages and deployment environments in a declarative file, making complex builds easier to manage. It also leverages BuildKit’s parallelization and optimization features to speed up build times.</p>

		<p>At Docker, we’re committed to simplifying the developer experience and empowering enterprises to scale securely and efficiently. With the Docker Desktop 4.38 release, teams can look forward to improved developer productivity and enterprise governance. </p>
<p>We’re excited to announce the General Availability of Bake, a powerful feature for optimizing build performance and multi-node Kubernetes testing to help teams “shift left.” We’re also expanding availability for several enterprise features designed to boost operational efficiency. And last but not least, Docker AI Agent (formerly Project: Agent Gordon) is now in Beta, delivering intelligent, real-time Docker-related suggestions across Docker CLI, Desktop, and Hub. It’s here to help developers navigate Docker concepts, fix errors, and boost productivity.</p>
