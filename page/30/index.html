The new Mozilla Firefox 136 release delivers a number of notable new features—features Mozilla may be hoping help it re-earn some goodwill from users following last week’s privacy palaver. Last month’s Firefox 135 release rolled out a refreshed tab page to more users, added in-page translations from Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, enforced certificate transparency, and ditched the ‘Do Not Track’ setting. This month sees a long-anticipated features make their stable release debut: vertical tabs! Right-click an empty space in the tab bar, select Turn on Vertical Tabs from the context menu and—bam!—they appear instantly as a a vertical strip of icons on the left-hand […]</p>

A few months back Firefox announced it was finally adding support for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) after years of ignoring its own user’s requests to do so. If you’re running a recent Firefox Nightly build, you can now flicking the switch on an experimental hidden flag — browser.taskbarTabs.enabled — in the about:config page to enable the feature (which Mozilla is calling Taskbar Tabs). Right now, enabling that flag won’t do anything (on any platform). But the fact the flag has been added ought to mean the feature itself isn’t too far behind. In anticipation, here’s a look at what we might […]</p>

<p>As we prepare to step into 2025, cloud security continues to remodel in response to emerging needs – the wide adoption of AI, regulatory demands and increasing cyberthreats. Our company’s cloud security leaders are on the heels of these threats with Palo Alto Networks global 2025 predictions, laying out the top cloud security predictions for the coming year.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, protecting cloud environments won’t just be the top priority – it will be imperative. With organizations moving substantial amounts of data for AI-driven workflows to the cloud, the dependency on cloud infrastructures has taken on new depths. This shift, coupled with the expanding attack surface, has magnified the importance of comprehensive strategies for cloud security.</p>

<p>With the release of iOS 17.3, Apple introduced a new security feature called “Stolen Device Protection.” This functionality is designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data in cases where a thief has gained knowledge of an iPhone’s passcode. While this feature significantly enhances security for end users, it simultaneously creates substantial obstacles for digital forensic experts, complicating lawful data extraction.</p>
<h2 id="a-roadblock-to-logical-extraction">A Roadblock to Logical Extraction</h2>
<p>Gaining access to data on Apple devices has historically been most feasible through standard mechanisms leveraged by many forensic tools, including iOS Forensic Toolkit, as part of an advanced logical extraction process. Alternative methods, such as low-level extraction, are either limited to older devices and iOS versions (currently, iOS 16.6.1 is the latest iOS build supported by iOS Forensic Toolkit) or legacy devices. Cloud-based analysis also presents challenges, as it requires full user credentials, and the device passcode is required on top of that to access end-to-end encrypted data.</p>

<p>Open source projects generally begin with a problem to be solved. If it’s a problem a lot of people have, it may gain traction. Eventually you might have many people contributing. Before you know it, your project might turn into more than just a project, but a community.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment grows, you might develop a need to grant cross-account access to resources. This could be for various reasons, such as enabling centralized operations across multiple AWS accounts, sharing resources across teams or projects within your organization, or integrating with third-party services. However, granting cross-account access requires careful consideration of your security, availability, and manageability requirements.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explore four different ways to grant cross-account access using resource-based policies. Each method has its own unique tradeoffs, and the best choice depends on your specific requirements and use case.</p>

		<p>At Tuta, we are deeply concerned about the proposed amendment to the so-called &ldquo;Narcotrafic&rdquo; law, which would force encrypted communication providers to implement backdoors for law enforcement. This would threaten everybody’s security and privacy and could be in conflict with European data protection legislation and Germany&rsquo;s IT Security Act. We urge the French National Assembly to reject this dangerous amendment. A backdoor for the good guys only is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>March 6, 2025:</strong> We’ve updated this post to clarify that generated domain reports contain only HTTP and HTTPS traffic domain log data collected from the moment traffic analysis mode is enabled, with a maximum of 30 days.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to controlling incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) network traffic, organizations typically focus heavily on inbound traffic controls—carefully restricting what traffic can enter their network perimeter. However, this approach addresses only inbound security challenges. Modern applications rely heavily on third-party code through operating systems, libraries, and packages. This dependency can create potential security vulnerabilities. If these components are compromised, affected workloads might attempt to connect to unauthorized command and control servers or send sensitive data to unauthorized destinations on the internet.</p>
