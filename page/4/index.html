<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-30345<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> March 21, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 43 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When creating new chats via the chat_group.create action, the user is able to specify the name of the chat. Some HTML elements such as SCRIPT are filtered, whereas others are not. In most cases, HTML entities are encoded properly, but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This potentially allows attackers to interfere with the layout of the rendered website, but it is unlikely that victims would click on deleted chats or deleted messages.<br>

<strong>Published :</strong> March 21, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 43 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> An XSS issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When submitting descriptions such as Moderator Notes or Agenda Topics, an editor is shown that allows one to format the submitted text. This allows insertion of various HTML elements. When trying to insert a SCRIPT element, it is properly encoded when reflected; however, adding attributes to links is possible, which allows the injection of JavaScript via the onmouseover attribute and others. When a user moves the mouse over such a prepared link, JavaScript is executed in that user&rsquo;s session.<br>

<strong>Published :</strong> March 21, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 43 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> A directory traversal issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. Files can be uploaded to OpenSlides meetings and organized in folders. The interface allows users to download a ZIP archive that contains all files in a folder and its subfolders. If an attacker specifies the title of a file or folder as a relative or absolute path (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd), the ZIP archive generated for download converts that title into a path. Depending on the extraction tool used by the user, this might overwrite files locally outside of the chosen directory.<br>
