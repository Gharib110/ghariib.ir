		<p>In response to growing worries about the safety of children using Roblox, the CEO of the company has said to parents: ‚ÄúMy first message would be, if you‚Äôre not comfortable, don‚Äôt let your kids be on Roblox.‚Äù</p>
<p>Roblox is one of the most popular gaming platforms, especially among young children. Reportedly, of the over 80 million players per day, roughly 40% of them are below the age of 13.</p>
<p>As we wrote last month, a lawsuit was recently initiated against Roblox and messaging platform Discord, in which Roblox was referred to as a ‚Äúreal-life nightmare for children.‚Äù</p>

	<div>
		<p>In‚ÄØ2020, Google introduced Core Web Vitals metrics to measure some aspects of real-world user experience on the web. This blog has consistently achieved good scores for two of these metrics: Largest Contentful Paint and Interaction to Next Paint. However, optimizing the third metric, Cumulative Layout Shift, which measures unexpected layout changes, has been more challenging. Let‚Äôs face it: optimizing for this metric is not really useful for a site like this one. But getting a better score is always a good distraction. üíØ</p>

<p>With the increasing adoption of mobile banking and payment apps, financial institutions face greater challenges in securing cardholder data. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) outlines stringent requirements to protect payment card data, ensuring that institutions maintain trust and security in their mobile ecosystems. Additionally, the European Payment Services Directives (PSD2 and the upcoming PSD3) introduce mandates like Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to further enhance security in electronic payments.</p>
