<p>In the midst of world-wide protests against racism and police brutality, a lot of people are becoming more immediately aware and concerned about the security of their data and online communication. We’ve gotten a lot of questions at Signal over the past week, so we wanted to briefly recap how it is that we’ve designed Signal, and how we think about concepts like privacy, security, and trust.</p>

<p>Right now, people around the world are marching and protesting against racism and police brutality, outraged by the most recent police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At Signal, we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we don’t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out.</p>

<p>Some time ago in 2016 I backed a Kickstarter for the <a href="https://onion.io/omega2/">Omega2</a> board. This is a tiny Linux powered computer meant for IoT development. I had plans to make cool things with it at the time, but the reality of it was that the Omega2+ ended up in my closet to be forgotten. Fast forward to 2020, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, I’m on vacation looking for things to do, and now seemed like a good time to put the Omega2+ to use.</p>
