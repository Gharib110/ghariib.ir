	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>After a little more than a month back in the White House in 2025, Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency has already left a profound mark on the U.S. economy, reigniting debates over tariffs, inflation, unemployment, and the broader economic trajectory. His return was heralded by promises of revitalizing American industry, curbing inflation, and restoring economic dominance. However, the reality of his first 40 days paints a more complex picture, shaped by inherited challenges, aggressive policy shifts, and a global economy less forgiving than in his previous term.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>President Trump entered the Oval Office like a tornado, signing more executive orders in his first two weeks than any president has signed in his first 100 days since President Harry Truman. His America First agenda will reshape trade and foreign policy, ushering in a new protectionist era. His imposition of tariffs, and bluster in wanting to make Canada the 51st state, has not only increased Canada‚Äôs anxiety level but revived the political fortunes of the country‚Äôs left-leaning Liberal establishment. A recent Leger poll found that 75 percent of Canadians view President Trump negatively and 13 percent view him favorably. This has galvanized Canadians around the Liberal Party, stealing support from the socialist NDP and the Conservatives who have lost their big lead in the polls.</p>

<p>When it comes to choosing a manufacturer to target for attack, threat groups have a healthy list of tools from which to choose. All of which are made more powerful due to this industry‚Äôs complex cybersecurity posture, driven by the increasing integration of IT/OT environments.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Istio has long been a popular choice for managing microservices, offering traffic management, security, and observability in Kubernetes. But as powerful as it is, the traditional sidecar-based approach comes with its own challenges, which can be complex and resource intensive. With ambient mode, Istio removes the need for sidecars, making service mesh deployments lighter, more flexible, and easier to manage.</p>
<p>In this article, we‚Äôll review the ambient architecture, how it works, and why it‚Äôs important. We‚Äôll also look at its benefits, compare it to the traditional sidecar model, and how to deploy ambient mode using the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 operator.</p>

		<p><em>I‚Äôm supposed to be finishing a wonky series on proof systems (here and here) and I promise I will do that this week. In the midst of this I‚Äôve been a bit distracted by world events.</em></p>
<p>Last week the Washington Post published a bombshell story announcing that the U.K. had filed ‚Äútechnical capability notices‚Äù demanding that Apple modify the encryption used in their Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system for iCloud. For those who don‚Äôt know about ADP, it‚Äôs a system that enables full ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù encryption for iCloud backups, including photos and other data. This means that your backup data should be encrypted under your phone‚Äôs passcode ‚Äî and critically, neither Apple nor hackers can access it. The U.K. request would secretly weaken that feature for at least some users.</p>

<p>After May 31, 2025, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instances on Azure will no longer receive critical security updates through standard channels, potentially affecting compliance with standards like PCI-DSS, SOC 2, or GDPR.</p>
