		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-24353<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 23, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 26 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 5.0 | MEDIUM<br>

<strong>Description :</strong> Jenkins OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.452.v2849b_d3945fa_ and earlier, except 4.438.440.v3f5f201de5dc, treats usernames as case-insensitive, allowing attackers on Jenkins instances configured with a case-sensitive OpenID Connect provider to log in as any user by providing a username that differs only in letter case, potentially gaining administrator access to Jenkins.<br>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 23, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are expected to reach $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. This represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history and is exponentially larger than the damage inflicted from natural disasters in a year.</p>

<p>As the electric vehicle takeover slowly lumbers along, marginally increasing efficiencies for certain applications while entrenching car-centric urban design even further, there are some knock-on effects that are benefiting people and infrastructure beyond simple transportation. Vehicle-to-grid technology has applications for providing energy from the car back to the grid for things like power outages or grid leveling. But [Technology Connections] is taking this logic one step further. Since a large number of EV owners have charging stations built into their garages, he wondered if these charging stations could be used for other tasks and built an electric heater which can use one for power.</p>

<p>Cyber security education is not just a priority—it’s a necessity in today’s digital landscape. With cyber attacks on the rise globally, there is an unprecedented demand for skilled professionals to safeguard critical infrastructures, businesses, and individuals. To address this urgent need, Check Point’s SecureAcademy Program collaborates with over 20 nonprofits and 200 institutions worldwide, delivering cutting-edge cyber security training to underserved and diverse communities. Nonprofits are uniquely vulnerable to cyber attacks due to several factors. Many lack dedicated IT staff with cyber security expertise, making it difficult to identify and address vulnerabilities. Budget constraints often prevent them from investing in […]</p>

		<p>Red Hat Go Toolset includes modifications to allow applications to optionally use OpenSSL as a cryptographic backend instead of the standard Go crypto implementation. This approach replaces upstream Go’s BoringSSL bindings with bindings into Red Hat’s own distribution of OpenSSL. The Go Toolset runtime is designed to be able to detect whether or not the operating system is booted in FIPS mode and to select either the standard crypto or OpenSSL back end accordingly.</p>
