<p>If you are testing the security of WordPress websites, you will likely have to look at the REST endpoints. By default, users can be listed with the route “/wp-json/wp/v2/users”. On the latest WordPress version, out of the box, you will get the username and the hashed email. Experienced WordPress administrators and users are aware of the potential disclosure. Therefore, we can see various tutorials online on how to hide this information. The recommended ways are either to disable the REST API completely,<br>
install a security plugin which disables the specific route or block specific request paths.</p>

		<p>A patch is available for a vulnerability in 7-Zip that could have allowed attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) security feature in Windows.</p>
<p>The MotW is an attribute added to files by Windows when they have been sourced from an untrusted location, like the internet or a restricted zone. The MotW is what triggers warnings that opening or running such files could lead to potentially dangerous behavior, including installing malware on their devices. 7-Zip added support for MotW in June 2022.</p>

<p>In this first blog post about <em>DNS rebinding</em> topic,  we are going to show a practical example of <strong>DNS Rebinding attack against UPnP services</strong> exposed in a local network. </p>
<p>The goal  of this post series is to show real attack scenarios against devices exposing services on a local network. </p>
<p>That case study tends to happen usually on <strong>IoT interconnected home or smart office devices</strong>, which are a very interesting scenario from an attacker perspective.</p>

<p>In the first part, after a fast overview on the <em>DNS Rebinding</em> technique, we considered a practical example in which UPnP services has been exploited to perform NAT Injection attacks and, therefore, expose internal services on Internet.</p>
<p>In this second post we are going to demonstrate how <em>DNS Rebinding</em> could be used to exploit vulnerable services running locally in order to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Survey on Transciphering and Symmetric Ciphers for Homomorphic Encryption</strong><br>
<em>Indranil Thakur, Angshuman Karmakar, Chaoyun Li, Bart Preneel</em></p>
<p>Data privacy concerns are sharply rising in the current digital era, hyperdriven by cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as an ideal technique for computing on encrypted data, but current schemes suffer from slow encryption speed and large ciphertext expansion. Practical implementation is hindered, especially when the client has limited bandwidth, memory, and computing power. In 2011, Naehrig et al. proposed transciphering, reducing computational and communication overload on the client side. This involves symmetric ciphers with minimized multiplicative complexity, referred to as HE-Friendly Ciphers (HEFCs).</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Adaptive Hardcore Bit and Quantum Key Leasing over Classical Channel from LWE with Polynomial Modulus</strong><br>
<em>Duong Hieu Phan, Weiqiang Wen, Xingyu Yan, Jinwei Zheng</em></p>
<p>Quantum key leasing, also known as public key encryption with secure key leasing (PKE-SKL), allows a user to lease a (quantum) secret key to a server for decryption purpose, with the capability of revoking the key afterwards. In the pioneering work by Chardouvelis et al (arXiv:2310.14328), a PKE-SKL scheme utilizing classical channels was successfully built upon the noisy trapdoor claw-free (NTCF) family. This approach, however, relies on the superpolynomial hardness of learning with errors (LWE) problem, which could affect both efficiency and security of the scheme.</p>

<p>As we approach 2025, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is set to dramatically reshape the cyber security landscape. As an AI and cyber security expert, I foresee several key developments that will significantly impact our digital world. The surge in AI usage will have far-reaching implications for areas such as energy consumption, software development, and ethical and legal frameworks. Of course, AI technologies will also be weaponized by cyber criminals and nation state actors, creating new and formidable threats to cyber security. The AI Explosion The adoption of AI technologies is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. ChatGPT, for […]</p>

		<p>It’s just become even more important to be conscious about the pictures we post online.</p>
<p>GeoSpy is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported tool that can derive a person’s location by analyzing features in a photo like vegetation, buildings, and other landmarks. And it can do so in seconds based on one picture.</p>
<p>Graylark Technologies who makes GeoSpy says it’s been developed for government and law enforcement. But the investigative journalists from 404 Media report that the tool has also been used for months by members of the public, with many making videos marveling at the technology, and some asking for help with stalking specific women.</p>
