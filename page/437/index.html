		<p>The FBI, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency have issued a new advisory stating that the BianLian ransomware operation has changed its strategy and is now predominantly a data theft extortion gang.

		<p>Hard to fathom we’re already a month into 2024! With the new year comes speculation about what’s on the horizon. Peeking around the corner at what’s next is one of my favorite pastimes. But before gazing farther ahead, it&rsquo;s worth glancing back… In retrospect, 2023 was a transformative year. We connected IRL at KubeCon, VMware Explore, re:Invent and ContainerConf. Internally, initiatives like Giant Mansions and our much-loved Onsite powered human connections despite dispersed teams. As per my now-annual tradition of making predictions to navigate the year ahead, let’s check the rearview to see how accurate my 2023 forecasts proved before guessing what 2024 has in store.</p>

		<p>The 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review is our fifth annual review of Internet trends and patterns observed throughout the year at both a global and country/region level across a variety of metrics. In this year’s review, we have added several new traffic, adoption, connectivity, and email security metrics, as well as the ability to do year-over-year and geographic comparisons for selected metrics. </p>
<p>Below, we present a summary of key findings, and then explore them in more detail in subsequent sections.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>On November 14, 2024, Cloudflare experienced an incident which impacted the majority of customers using Cloudflare Logs. During the roughly 3.5 hours that these services were impacted, about 55% of the logs we normally send to customers were not sent and were lost. We’re very sorry this happened, and we are working to ensure that a similar issue doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>This blog post explains what happened and what we’re doing to prevent recurrences. Also, the systems involved and the particular class of failure we experienced will hopefully be of interest to engineering teams beyond those specifically using these products.</p>

<p>This is a step by step guide shows how to compile the Kdenlive video editor 24.12.0 from source tarball in Ubuntu 24.10.</p>
<p>The popular Kdenlive video editor dropped native <code>.deb</code> package support for Ubuntu since version 24.02. It now provides official Flatpak package and AppImage for universal Linux support.</p>
<p>If you don’t like running it in sandbox environment, then you may choose to build it from source by yourself! And, here’s how to do the job for the most recent 24.12.0 release.</p>
