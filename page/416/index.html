		<p>The OneLogin hack is blowing up now it seems like whoever got access can also decrypt encrypted customer data which is just about AS BAD as it can get for a password/identity management service.

		<p>Have you ever built a piece of IKEA furniture, or put together a LEGO set, by following the instructions closely and only at the end realized at some point you didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> follow them correctly? The final result might be close to what was intended, but there&rsquo;s a nagging thought that maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;s not as rock steady or functional as it could have been.</p>
<p>Internet protocol specifications are instructions designed for engineers to build things. Protocol designers take great care to ensure the documents they produce are clear. The standardization process gathers consensus and review from experts in the field, to further ensure document quality. Any reasonably skilled engineer should be able to take a specification and produce a performant, reliable, and secure implementation. The Internet is central to everyone&rsquo;s lives, and we depend on these implementations. Any deviations from the specification can put us at risk. For example, mishandling of malformed requests can allow attacks such as request smuggling.</p>
