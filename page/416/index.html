<p>Imagine a business that knows its survival depends on change—but can&rsquo;t decide how to act. This scenario plays out more often than you&rsquo;d think, with fear of failure paralysing decision-making and ensuring stagnation. This scenario can be summarised as a paradox:</p>

		<p><em>As we mentioned in a previous blog</em>_, SAFECode’s post-quantum cryptography (PQC) working group has reached a milestone. NIST has standardized its first wave of post-quantum encryption algorithms, and our working group has identified key activities that will enable our members to manage the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography and adapt to the emergence of new algorithms that may be standardized by NIST or other national agencies._</p>
<p><em>As part of wrapping up the working group’s activities for now, working group members Judy Furlong of Dell and Brian Rosenberg of RTX presented a webinar for SAFECode members that shared valuable insights on how organizations can prepare for this crucial transition. The following is a brief summary of the webinar to complement</em> <em>blog</em> <em>we released a few weeks ago.</em></p>

		<p>Welcome to Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 - our first event ever from the emerald isle! This year’s contest is set to be one of our largest ever - both in terms of entries and potential prizes. If everything hits, we will end up paying out over $1,000,000 in cash and prizes. We’ve got four days of exciting competition ahead. As always, we began our contest with a random drawing to determine the order of attempts. If you missed it, you can watch the replay here.</p>

		<p>It’s the final day of our first ever Pwn2Own Ireland. After three days of exploitation, we have awarded $993,625, so it seem likely we will pass the $1,000,000 mark. Still, there are no guarantees in Pwn2Own, so stay tuned for all the results.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And we are done! Over the four days of the contest, we awarded $1,066,625 for over 70 0-day vulnerabilities. That makes four contests in a row that exceeded the million-dollar mark. Congratulations to the Viettel Cyber Security team for winning Master of Pwn with 33 points and $205,000. Our next event will be January 22-24, 2025 in Tokyo as we return for the second Pwn2Own Automotive. We hope to see you there.</em></p>
