<p>In the last decade one of the most common patterns observed in web applications is their shift to cloud environments. This means that in 2023 you can’t evaluate the security of a web application without going through a review of its cloud infrastructure as you might miss the elephant in the room. That’s why we - as in Shielder - always try to learn new techniques to assess the security of cloud environments. This post is about a privilege escalation vector which we have discovered during a recent assessment and which was not documented.</p>
