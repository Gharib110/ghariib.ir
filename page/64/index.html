	<b><time>07.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Late last year we had the pleasure of being reached out to by Microsoft in regards to participating in the launch of the new, modern, WSL distribution architecture. In summary, this new architecture allows for easier distribution and installation of WSL distros. For the full explanation of how this works, please view Microsoft’s blog post and their documentation.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Microsoft’s WSL team, we are proud to say that we were the first Linux distro to be accepted onto this new modern distribution list. In this blog post we will cover the journey and share how you can try out this new architecture, but if you are just looking for the hands on portion then please see here.</p>

	<b><time>07.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The <code>i386</code> architecture has long been obsolete, and from this week, support for i386 in Kali Linux is going to shrink significantly: i386 kernel and images are going away. Images and releases will no longer be created for this platform.</p>
<h2 id="some-terminology-first">Some terminology first</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the terms used in Kali Linux to talk about CPU architectures. These terms apply more generally to any Debian-based Linux distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>amd64</code> refers to the x86-64 architecture, ie. the <em>64-bit version of the x86 instruction set</em>.</li>
<li><code>i386</code> refers to the x86 architecture, ie. the <em>original 32-bit x86 architecture</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-changing">What’s changing</h2>
<p>First, the <strong>Linux kernel</strong>: starting version 6.11 (that just landed in Kali rolling), the kernel is no longer built for the i386 architecture.</p>
