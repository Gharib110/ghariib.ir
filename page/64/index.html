<p>Tax season isn’t just busy for taxpayers—it’s prime time for scammers, too. As you gather your W-2s, 1099s, and other tax documents, cybercriminals are gearing up to exploit the flood of personal and financial data in circulation. From phishing emails posing as the IRS to fake tax preparers looking to steal your refund, these scams can lead to identity theft, fraudulent tax returns, and serious financial headaches. </p>
<p>The good news? IRS scams follow predictable patterns, and with a little awareness, you can spot the warning signs before falling victim. Let’s break down the most common tax scams and how you can safeguard your personal information this filing season. </p>

		<p>Most countries have some sort of government agency dedicated to protecting digital infrastructure and promoting cybersecurity awareness. In the English-speaking world alone, the UK has the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), the US has the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST), and Canada has the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security; chances are you’re already aware of them. However, cybersecurity knows no borders. Expanding our knowledge beyond the anglosphere is crucial to working effectively in the modern world.

	<div>
		<p>Attackers always seek the easiest path to get into our systems and compromise data. System misconfigurations and insecure default settings are often the criminals&rsquo; favorite vectors since these errors allow them easy access to critical systems and data. The rise of misconfiguration errors was primarily driven by cloud data storage implementations deployed without appropriate access controls. Despite the efforts of the major cloud providers to make the default configurations more secure, these errors persist. Organizations have many good reasons to locate and remediate insecure configurations&hellip;</p>

		<p>System hardening means locking down a system and reducing its attack surface: removing unnecessary software packages, securing default values to the tightest possible settings and configuring the system to only run what you explicitly require.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example from daily life. A jewellery store and a grocery shop are located next to each other, but of course, you would expect that the jewellery store has much beefier bars and stronger locks that are shut when the shop is closed for the night as the contents are more valuable. In this case, the jewellery shop building has been hardened to protect precious products and deter thieves.</p>

		<p>Virtualization lets organizations run multiple isolated workloads from the same hardware platform, saving money, and enabling more efficient scaling. It is also used by cloud providers to deliver on-demand computing resources for multiple customers using shared hardware. It’s what allows businesses to pay for only the cloud computing resources they need and quickly (or even &hellip;</p>

		<p>Managing state in React applications can quickly become complex, especially as your application grows. One of the most common questions developers face is when and how to split their reducers. Let&rsquo;s dive into this topic with real-world examples and practical advice.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a common scenario: an e-commerce dashboard that manages both UI state (like modal visibility, selected tabs) and data state (product inventory, orders). Initially, you might start with a single reducer:</p>
