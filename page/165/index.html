<p>“Data structures are like tools in a toolbox—master the advanced ones, and you’ll be building solutions that others can only dream of. Just remember, even the best carpenter starts with a few bent nails.” - <strong>Hardik Gayner</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So, you’ve decided to dive into advanced data structures, huh? Congratulations! You’re either a masochist or someone who genuinely enjoys the challenge of bending your brain into new shapes. Either way, let’s embark on this journey together, and I promise, we’ll keep the tears to a minimum (or at least try).</p>

	<div>
		<p>With the majority of our applications now being cloud-native and containerized, ensuring security has become paramount. While static security measures, such as image scanning with Amazon Inspector, play a crucial role, monitoring container security during runtime is equally important. This is where ECS Runtime Monitoring with Amazon GuardDuty comes into play. GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring, now over a year in general availability, has proven its effectiveness in detecting runtime security threats across EC2 instances, ECS Clusters, and EKS Clusters. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll walk through enabling runtime monitoring for your ECS Cluster, generating GuardDuty findings, and setting up alerts for both runtime monitoring health and GuardDuty Findings to enhance your security posture.</p>

		<p>Installation of the malware in targeted routers facilitates the deployment of a cd00r variant scanning for five network signals, which when received triggers reverse shell creation on the local file system, enabling device takeover, data exfiltration, and additional malware compromise, according to an investigation by Black Lotus Labs researchers.</p>

<p>Threat actors are exploiting an unspecified zero-day vulnerability in Cambium Networks cnPilot routers to deploy a variant of the AISURU botnet called AIRASHI to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>According to QiAnXin XLab, the attacks have leveraged the security flaw since June 2024. Additional details about the shortcomings have been withheld to prevent further abuse.</p>
<p>Some of the other flaws weaponized by the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet include CVE-2013–3307, CVE-2016–20016, CVE-2017–5259, CVE-2018–14558, CVE-2020–25499, CVE-2020–8515, CVE-2022–3573, CVE-2022–40005, CVE-2022–44149, CVE-2023–28771, as well as those impacting AVTECH IP cameras, LILIN DVRs, and Shenzhen TVT devices.</p>
