<p>Here at Mandiant FLARE, malware reverse engineering is a regular part of our day jobs. At times we are required to perform basic triages on binaries, where every hour saved is critical to incident response timelines. At other times we examine complicated samples for days developing comprehensive analysis reports. As we face larger and more complex malware, often written in modern languages like Rust, knowing where to go, what to look at, and developing a &ldquo;map&rdquo; of the malware forms a significant effort that directly impacts our response times and triage effectiveness.</p>

<p>I have a Gitlab runner which runs every day, and sometimes builds and pushes a new docker image if a new version of some software has been released. I wanted to update it to send me an email after pushing an image. I didn’t find any options in Dockerhub or Gitlab to do this. Dockerhub lets you call out to a webhook, so I guess I could do something with IFTTT or similar but I really didn’t want to have to sign up to another service to handle this.</p>
