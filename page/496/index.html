		<p>Ventiva showed off the first laptop fully cooled by its ICE9 fanless tech at CES 2025.</p>
<p>Last year, we were excited to see the launch of Ventiva&rsquo;s wizard-like ICE9 fanless cooling technology and were wowed by their invention&rsquo;s ability to push massive amounts of air without making a sound. We&rsquo;ve been eagerly awaiting a real-world implementation of this product in a laptop, and thanks to the joint efforts of Ventiva, Dell, and Intel, the company debuted a laptop cooled entirely by their ICE technology at CES 2025.</p>

		<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Those who know me are aware of how much I love the Japanese language and how dedicated I am to self-studying it. They also know that I can never sit still. For this reason, I developed <strong>Wakaruyo</strong>, a browser extension that is currently in the experimental phase.</p>
<p>This extension allows you to translate selected text on a webpage from Japanese to the language set in your browser, which is automatically detected.</p>

		<p>At Canonical, the work of our teams is strongly embedded in the open source principles and philosophy. We believe open source software will become the most prevalent method of software development and delivery in the future. Being open source is more than making the source of your software available, it’s also about contributing to other open source projects and helping to build communities. With this in mind, the web engineering team recently had the privilege of dedicating a week solely to contribute to external open source projects. We do this every year. </p>

<p>At one point or another, you may have noticed that Windows labels your Wi-Fi networks as either private or public networks in the Wi-Fi settings. In fact, by default, they&rsquo;re all public networks, even if you&rsquo;re using it at home.</p>

		<p>The expanding attack surface is creating more opportunities for exploitation and adding to the pressure on security leaders and teams. Increasingly, organizations are investing in managed detection and response services (MDR) to bolster their security operations center (SOC) and meet the challenge. Demand is growing rapidly: according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market for MDR is expanding at a rate of 35.2% annually.1   </p>
<p>While there are new vendors launching MDR services regularly, many security teams are turning to Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR, a recognized leader, to deliver comprehensive coverage.1 Employed worldwide by organizations across industries, Microsoft’s team of dedicated experts proactively hunts for cyberthreats and triages, investigates, and responds to incidents on a customer’s behalf around the clock across their most critical assets. Our proven service brings together in-house security professionals and industry-leading protection with Microsoft Defender XDR to help security teams rapidly stop cyberthreats and keep their environments secure.2 </p>

		<p>Games business journalist Chris Dring offers insight into how Xbox Game Pass impacts game sales on Xbox.</p>
<p>When Xbox unveiled its new generation of subscription services with Xbox Game Pass in 2017, the appeal for players was immediately apparent. Pay a monthly fee and get an ever-growing library of games right at your fingertips. Even brand-new releases from Xbox&rsquo;s first-party studios, at no extra cost. Like Netflix, but for games, and with limited-time promotions that made the cost of a Game Pass subscription as low as $1, Game Pass colloquially earned the title, &rsquo;the best deal in gaming.'</p>

		<p>A ZLoader malware campaign is exploiting a nine-year-old flaw in Microsoft’s digital signature verification to steal credentials and sensitive information using remote monitoring tools.</p>
<p>According to Check Point Research, which has been tracking the sophisticated infection chain since November 2021, it has been attributed to a cybercriminal group dubbed MalSmoke, citing similarities with previous attacks. “The infection chain incorporates legitimate remote management software (RMM) to gain access to the target machine.” After injecting its payload into a signed DLL, the malware further evades the system’s defenses by exploiting Microsoft’s digital signature verification.</p>

<p>In the world of cybersecurity, compliance is a no-brainer. Adhering to corporate and regulatory compliance standards is critical for enterprises. And while compliance does not ensure active and constant protection against cybersecurity threats, it&rsquo;s a standard to aim for that can ensure stealthier cybersecurity for enterprises. </p>
<p>Chris Hughes, CEO of Aquia, said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/resilientcyber_lawyers-cyber-activity-7262454456309497856-Scov/">recent LinkedIn post that</a> it&rsquo;s a good baseline for enterprises — and the most effective way to get organizations to invest in cybersecurity</p>
