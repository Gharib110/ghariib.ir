		<p>As Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) approaches its planned May 31, 2025 end of standard support, Azure users must proactively evaluate their options to maintain security and regulatory compliance.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What this means for you</h2>
<p>After May 31, 2025, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instances on Azure will no longer receive critical security updates through standard channels, potentially affecting compliance with standards like PCI-DSS, SOC 2, or GDPR.</p>

If you’re an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS user regularly experiencing issues with connecting to audio devices, there’s an important update to the Bluetooth stack rolling out this week. A slew of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS users complained that certain paired Bluetooth audio devices (mainly earbuds/phones) fail to reconnect after a system restart or suspend. Plus, for many noble users reporting bugs, even attempting to manually connect to a previously-paired device following a reboot or suspend fails to connect or stay connected thus requiring the need to remove and re-pair the device to work. —Until the next reboot/suspend. The cause? Based on an […]</p>

<p>The default wallpapers for the upcoming Ubuntu 25.04 has been revealed today. Here are the download link along with the competition winner images.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 25.04, code-name Plucky Puffin, is a short-term release planned to be made available on April 17, 2025. It features GNOME Desktop 48 and Linux Kernel 6.14 (though it’s still in RC development stage), with official support until Jan 2026.</p>

With Ubuntu 25.04 feature freeze now in effect the final licks of polish and paint have begun landing — including an update to Ubuntu’s Yaru theme. The Yaru theme is composed of a modified GTK4/libadwaita stylesheet, GNOME Shell theme, icon pack, and set of system sounds. With visual change and new features in GNOME 48 to account for, the design team working on Yaru have dutifully update the theme to accommodate. Most of the changes are subtle, but Yaru’s oversized icon bug I reported on last month? Fixes to address that did make it in. Thus, in 25.04 you may […]</p>

Earlier this year Ubuntu announced plans to replace document viewer app Evince with Papers, a modern GTK4/libadwaita fork1 of the former, in Ubuntu 25.04—today, the swap was made official. Papers is a fork of Evince that is actively maintained and makes use of newer technologies (GTK4, THIS), that are already present in Ubuntu. Upstream, GNOME 48 (out in March) opts to keep Evince as a core app but GNOME 49 is expected to switch to Papers. Ubuntu feels no reason to wait. Dabbled with daily builds of the Plucky Puffin prior to now? You might have noticed Papers isn’t present […]</p>

<p>SOC Prime is excited to announce a major upgrade to Uncoder AI—an industry-first integrated development environment (IDE) and co-pilot for threat-informed detection engineering. The new release introduces a robust set of features designed to enhance how detection rules are created, translated, and optimized, acting as a game-changer for security teams to stay ahead in the evolving cybersecurity landscape.</p>
<p>Start Now</p>
<p>In the past decade, detection engineering has evolved from a niche skill into a core function of cybersecurity, underscoring the growing demand for specialized expertise across a wide range of technologies. As organizations work to enhance their detection workflows and tackle the increasing complexity of cyber threats, AI and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape. Uncoder AI blends cutting-edge machine learning and automation with collective industry expertise, acting as a powerful co-pilot for security teams. </p>

		<p>Today, one of the greatest challenges that cyber defenders face is analyzing detection hits from indicator feeds, which provide metadata about specific indicators of compromise (IOCs), like IP addresses, ASNs, domains, URLs, and hashes. While indicator feeds have proliferated across the threat intelligence industry, most feeds contain no contextual information about why an indicator was placed on the feed. Another limitation of most feeds today is that they focus solely on blockable indicators and cannot easily accommodate more complex cases, such as a threat actor exploiting a CVE or an insider threat. Instead, this sort of complex threat intelligence is left for long form reporting. However, long-form reporting comes with its own challenges, such as the time required for writing and editing, which can lead to significant delays in releasing timely threat intelligence.</p>
