<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Cybercrime makes up a majority of the malicious activity online and occupies the majority of defenders&rsquo; resources. In 2024, Mandiant Consulting responded to almost four times more intrusions conducted by financially motivated actors than state-backed intrusions. Despite this overwhelming volume, cybercrime receives much less attention from national security practitioners than the threat from state-backed groups. While the threat from state-backed hacking is rightly understood to be severe, it should not be evaluated in isolation from financially motivated intrusions. </p>

<p>XE Group, likely a Vietnam-linked hacking collective that has been active in the cyber threat arena for over a decade is believed to be behind the exploitation of a couple of VeraCore zero-day vulnerabilities. During the latest campaign, adversaries weaponized VeraCore flaws tracked as CVE-2024-57968 and CVE-2025-25181 to deploy reverse</p>
