<p>I am no stranger to Hawaii. Although I’ve never lived here myself, I’ve visited the islands perhaps a dozen times. My grandmother and my father were born and raised here. My mother attended college here. I have aunts, uncles, and cousins who’ve lived on various islands, moved away, came back, moved away and back again. I even have Native Hawaiian blood in my veins.</p>

<p>“I am torn on how best to introduce myself out of context like this, the idea of rattling off facts from my resume is my first instinct, but that seems terribly conventional. With the goal of introducing myself and the entirety of my character, my second (highly unconventional) instinct is to link you to my online dating profile with the prayer that such an action would be taken in the desired context. Through my indecision I hope to explain who I am and why I would like to travel across the country to be involved with the Institute for Disruptive Studies. So here goes…”</p>

<p>With over 300 tools in our repository, it’s close to impossible for us to keep *every* tool updated to the latest git version, all the time. A good example of this happed a few days ago, when we updated the <strong>SET</strong> package. Two days after we updated the package, we got a “tool upgrade” request for SET in our bug tracker, as our package was already outdated. Seems a bit extreme? Maybe not, <strong>consider the following conundrum</strong>:</p>

<p>One of the first times I met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie</a> while travelling, we met at a dive bar in San Francisco’s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.</p>
<p>I had a proposal, the sort of get-rich-quick scheme it seems that only 18th century pirates and lazy hacker-squatters are capable of contriving: We fly to China. Then, we spend a few grand purchasing a Chinese junk rig, and equip it with a system of pulleys so that we can man the sails from the cockpit, solo if necessary. Next, we fill the cabin with about as much potable water as we can carry and enough dried food to stave off starvation, and set a course across the northern arc of the Pacific – avoiding the treachery of the South Seas – for San Francisco. The choice of vessel was key, the battened sails and flattened hull of a Chinese junk rig make it arguably one of the safest ships to make a transoceanic voyage alone, not to mention the financial incentives: being rare in the Americas, a well-kept junk rig would go for anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 USD – not to mention grant you free slip fees at just about any marina from Anchorage to Punta Arenas. How could anyone turn down such a preposterous plot which included adventure on the high seas, a high mortality risk, riches and notoriety?</p>

<p>We have big hopes for our shiny “<a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">Kali Linux Documentation</a>” platform and will continue writing up useful articles that serve the Kali community. We have made the effort to automatically generate a PDF offline version of our server for public download (Removed in 2021). <strong>We strongly recommend that even experienced Linux and <a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack</a> users take the time to read through this documentation</strong>, as Kali Linux has some unique features which would throw off anyone without a proper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. PDF downloads for additional translated languages will become available soon as translation work speeds ahead.</p>

<p>It’s been 7 years since we released our first version of <a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack Linux</a>, and the ride so far has been exhilarating. When the dev team started talking about BackTrack 6 (almost a year ago), each of us put on paper a few “wish list goals” that we each wanted implemented in our “next version”.</p>

<p>“<strong>So, what’s the difference between <a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack</a> and Kali?</strong>” you might be asking. Unfortunately for us, that’s not a simple question to answer. It’s a mix between “everything” and “not much”, depending on how you used BackTrack.</p>
<p>From an end user perspective, the most obvious change would be the switch to Debian and an FHS-compliant system. What this means is that instead of having to navigate through the <strong>/pentest</strong> tree, you will be able to call any tool from anywhere on the system as every application is included in the system path. However, there’s much hidden magic in that last sentence. I’ll quickly list some of the new benefits of this move.</p>
