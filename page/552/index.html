<p>Getting Kali Linux to run on ARM hardware has been a major goal for us since day one. So far, we’ve built <strong>native</strong> images for the Samsung Chromebook, Odroid U2, Raspberry Pi, RK3306, Galaxy Note 10.1, CuBox, Efika MX, and BeagleBone Black to name a few. This however does not mean you cannot install Kali Linux in a chroot on almost any modern device that runs Android. In fact, the developers of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy&amp;hl=en">Linux Deploy</a> have made it extremely easy to get any number of Linux distributions installed in a chroot environment using a simple GUI builder.</p>

<p>A little while back, a bug with the LVM encrypted install in Kali Linux 1.0.4 was <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=443">reported</a> in our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/submitting-issues-kali-bug-tracker/">bug tracker</a>. This bug was high priority in our TODO as encrypted installs are an important feature in our industry so we wanted to squash this bug ASAP. This article will describe the process of debugging, identifying, and fixing this bug in Kali, and ultimately in Debian as well.</p>

<p>Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for cryptographic security. These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their outgoing message with that public key.</p>
