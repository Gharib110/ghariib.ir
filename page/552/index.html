<p><em>Spring Break Of Code, Day Three</em></p>
<p>I am no stranger to Hawaii. Although I’ve never lived here myself, I’ve visited the islands perhaps a dozen times. My grandmother and my father were born and raised here. My mother attended college here. I have aunts, uncles, and cousins who’ve lived on various islands, moved away, came back, moved away and back again. I even have Native Hawaiian blood in my veins.</p>

<p><em>Spring Break Of Code, Day Two</em></p>
<p>“I am torn on how best to introduce myself out of context like this, the idea of rattling off facts from my resume is my first instinct, but that seems terribly conventional. With the goal of introducing myself and the entirety of my character, my second (highly unconventional) instinct is to link you to my online dating profile with the prayer that such an action would be taken in the desired context. Through my indecision I hope to explain who I am and why I would like to travel across the country to be involved with the Institute for Disruptive Studies. So here goes…”</p>

We packaged some <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">new tools</a> which were pointed out by the community as missing, such as <strong>inguma</strong>, <strong>arachni</strong>, <strong>bully</strong>, <strong>lbd</strong>, <strong>uniscan</strong>, <strong>automater</strong>, as well as started to build a framework of libraries and patches for bluetooth sniffing and ubertooth tools. We also fixed the Kali Menu to be editable again.</p>

<p>One of the first times I met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie</a> while travelling, we met at a dive bar in San Francisco’s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.</p>

<p>Five days into the <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/">Kali Linux</a> release at BlackHat EU in Amsterdam, and we’re still not fully recovered. Since the release, we’ve had just over <strong>90,000 downloads</strong>, a dozen or so package updates, added more articles to the Kali Documentation, started a <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">Portuguese translation</a>, and we even managed to squeeze in a small bugfix release (Kali 1.0.1), which resolved an annoying <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=63/">USB keyboard issue</a> some users reported. The responses to Kali so far have been extremely positive and our bug tracker is surely enough filling up with new tool requests. We encourage Open-source tool developers to contact us so that we can work together towards this goal.</p>

When the dev team started talking about BackTrack 6 (almost a year ago), each of us put on paper a few “wish list goals” that we each wanted implemented in our “next version”.</p>
