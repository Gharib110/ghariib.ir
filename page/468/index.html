		<p><em>This ongoing</em> <em>Docker Labs GenAI series</em> <em>explores the exciting space of AI developer tools. At Docker, we believe there is a vast scope to explore, openly and without the hype. We will share our explorations and collaborate with the developer community in real time. Although developers have adopted autocomplete tooling like GitHub Copilot and use chat, there is significant potential for AI tools to assist with more specific tasks and interfaces throughout the entire software lifecycle. Therefore, our exploration will be broad. We will be releasing software as open source so you can play, explore, and hack with us, too.</em></p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Vendor risk management (VRM) is critical for organizations relying on third-party vendors. As businesses increasingly depend on external partners, ensuring these vendors maintain high security standards is vital. ChatGPT can enhance and streamline various aspects of VRM. Here’s how and why you should integrate ChatGPT into your vendor risk management process:</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/how-platform-as-a-product-drives-cloud-native-platform-maturity-giant-swarm/">How Platform-as-a-Product drives cloud native platform maturity  » Giant Swarm</a></h1>
	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In the dynamic landscape of cloud native technologies, a standout trend emerges: platform engineering is the new cool kid in class! In the last few months alone, it’s hard to find a CNCF event without a spotlight on platform engineering. Notably, the 2024 KubeCon EU takes it a step further, dedicating a co-located event exclusively to this rising star.</p>
<p>Why the buzz? Simply put, it’s the evolution of the DevOps mindset, now taking center stage to empower countless developer teams. At its core, platform engineering revolves around making developers’ lives significantly easier by bootstrapping development capabilities into a developer platform. Imagine a world where requesting cloud native products doesn’t lead to drowning in a sea of tickets, relying on that one infrastructure guy you know or deciphering the nuances among myriad similar-sounding AWS offerings. No, DevOps is not dead; rather, platform engineering is the formalization of the DevOps mindset, especially driven within large enterprises. Developer platforms reduce the cognitive overload of developer teams while still empowering them with self-service infrastructure.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As cloud-native infrastructure evolves, managing Red Hat OpenShift clusters demands greater scalability and efficiency. Hosted control planes (HCP) represent a transformative approach in OpenShift, decoupling control planes and hosting them in lightweight, flexible pods. This innovation enhances resource utilization, multi-tenancy, and hybrid-cloud capabilities—key priorities for modern infrastructure.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Comments are an important part of any programming languages that help users to understand about working of code block. Similar to other programming languages Python also allows us to add comments in our code. We can use single line comments or multiline comment for block of code. Assuming you have to comment out multiple adjacent lines in a file, then you can use multi-line comments in your Python application.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about comment block of code in Python scripts. We can use triple quotes to comment out a block of code in Python. You can either use triple single-quotes <code>'''</code> or triple double-quotes <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>.</p>
