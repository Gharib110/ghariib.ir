<p>Five days into the <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/">Kali Linux</a> release at BlackHat EU in Amsterdam, and we’re still not fully recovered. Since the release, we’ve had just over <strong>90,000 downloads</strong>, a dozen or so package updates, added more articles to the Kali Documentation, started a <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">Portuguese translation</a>, and we even managed to squeeze in a small bugfix release (Kali 1.0.1), which resolved an annoying <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=63/">USB keyboard issue</a> some users reported. The responses to Kali so far have been extremely positive and our bug tracker is surely enough filling up with new tool requests. We encourage Open-source tool developers to contact us so that we can work together towards this goal.</p>

<p>It’s been 7 years since we released our first version of <a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack Linux</a>, and the ride so far has been exhilarating. When the dev team started talking about BackTrack 6 (almost a year ago), each of us put on paper a few “wish list goals” that we each wanted implemented in our “next version”.</p>

<p>RedPhone is our mobile app for end-to-end encrypted voice calls. When we talk about RedPhone, we tend to emphasize the cryptography, and how using it can help keep your communications safe. What we don’t talk about as much is the VoIP application underneath all of that, which it turns out was actually the hard part.</p>

<p>This Spring will be the first Open Whisper Systems <em>Spring Break Of Code</em>, a week-long, expenses-paid retreat to Maui for folks who like software development, security, and the beach. We’ve rented a large beachfront house on the west coast of Maui for everyone to stay in, and will pay for your airfare. While there, you can split your time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related project that you propose.</p>

<p>Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile security software, which was acquired by Twitter in late 2011. Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software available under an Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since been under open development by the community. The software has seen a number of new releases based on that open development, and we’ve been calling the project for this continued work “Open Whisper Systems.” Welcome to the project’s new home.</p>
