		<p>Just before the year starts to wrap up, we are getting the final 2024 release out! This contains a wide range of updates and changes, which are in already in effect, ready for immediate download, or updating.</p>

<li><strong>The End Of The i386 Kernel and Images</strong> - Farewell x86 <em>(images)</em>, but not goodbye <em>(packages)</em></li>

<h2 id="a-new-python-version-312">A New Python Version: 3.12</h2>
<p><strong>Python 3.12 is now the default Python interpreter</strong>. While it was released upstream a year ago , it took a bit of time to become the default in Debian , and then even more time to make it to Kali Linux , but finally it’s here. Every new version of Python brings along some deprecations or subtle changes of behavior, which in turn breaks some Python packages, and we have to investigate and fix all the issues reported by our QA system. Hence the delay.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 7, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 50 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Multiple Elber products are affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability which allows unauthorized access to the password management functionality. Attackers can exploit this issue by manipulating the endpoint to overwrite any user&rsquo;s password within the system. This grants them unauthorized administrative access to protected areas of the application, compromising the device&rsquo;s system security.<br>

<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 7, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 50 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Nextend Social Login Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.1.16. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during the Apple OAuth authenticate request through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.<br>
