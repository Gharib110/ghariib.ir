	<b><time>07.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Late last year we had the pleasure of being reached out to by Microsoft in regards to participating in the launch of the new, modern, WSL distribution architecture. In summary, this new architecture allows for easier distribution and installation of WSL distros. For the full explanation of how this works, please view Microsoft’s blog post and their documentation.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Microsoft’s WSL team, we are proud to say that we were the first Linux distro to be accepted onto this new modern distribution list. In this blog post we will cover the journey and share how you can try out this new architecture, but if you are just looking for the hands on portion then please see here.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/the-end-of-the-i386-kernel-and-images/">The end of the i386 kernel and images</a></h1>
	<b><time>07.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The <code>i386</code> architecture has long been obsolete, and from this week, support for i386 in Kali Linux is going to shrink significantly: i386 kernel and images are going away. Images and releases will no longer be created for this platform.</p>
<h2 id="some-terminology-first">Some terminology first</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the terms used in Kali Linux to talk about CPU architectures. These terms apply more generally to any Debian-based Linux distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>amd64</code> refers to the x86-64 architecture, ie. the <em>64-bit version of the x86 instruction set</em>.</li>
<li><code>i386</code> refers to the x86 architecture, ie. the <em>original 32-bit x86 architecture</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-changing">What’s changing</h2>
<p>First, the <strong>Linux kernel</strong>: starting version 6.11 (that just landed in Kali rolling), the kernel is no longer built for the i386 architecture.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Android takes a multi-layered approach to combating malware to help keep users safe (more later in the post), but while we continuously strengthen our defenses against malware, threat actors are persistently updating their malware to evade detection. Malware developers used to complete their entire malicious aggression using the common Android app development toolkits in Java, which is easier to detect by reversing the Java bytecode. In recent years, malware developers are increasing the use of native code to obfuscate some of the critical malware behaviors and putting their hopes on obscuration in compiled and symbol-stripped Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files, which can be more difficult and time-consuming to reveal their true intentions.</p>

		<p>When it comes to PC gaming, there are a lot of myths out there that might have deterred you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get into PC gaming but aren&rsquo;t sure how to, you&rsquo;re not alone. There&rsquo;s a lot of information out there, and it&rsquo;s hard to tell what&rsquo;s real and what isn&rsquo;t, especially if you&rsquo;ve heard things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily true. These are some of the biggest myths when it comes to PC gaming, so that you can have a better idea when it comes to building your PC of what you need to care about.</p>

		<p>These tools help me monitor and manage my hardware easily and effectively</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools you can use to improve your Windows experience, from customizing your desktop to optimizing the performance of your PC. But what if you want to take a closer look at your hardware components and change certain settings or features? I&rsquo;ve found that Windows doesn&rsquo;t give me the level of control I would like, but there are plenty of free apps available that do.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Strong, wide-reaching regulation can bring safety to communities – but it can also bring uncertainty. The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA, or just CRA for short) has proven no exception to this universal rule. Across the open source community and the wider tech landscape, people have been greeting the news with the whole spectrum of reactions: concern, anxiety, hope. </p>
<p>But is there anything to fear? Does the CRA really change things in open source? And how should your teams be preparing for this legislation? In this article, I’ll dive into the CRA and explain its aims, requirements, and effects on the open source community, and give my cybersecurity recommendations to prepare for the CRA.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Most people know that robots no longer sound like tinny trash cans. They sound like Siri, Alexa, and Gemini. They sound like the voices in labyrinthine customer support phone trees. And even those robot voices are being made obsolete by new AI-generated voices that can mimic every vocal nuance and tic of human speech, down to specific regional accents. And with just a few seconds of audio, AI can now clone someone’s specific voice.</p>
