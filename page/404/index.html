<p>I have really clear memories of listening to the Stack Overflow podcast in the late 2000&rsquo;s and hearing Jeff and Joel talk about the various challenges they were facing and the things they did to overcome them. I just suddenly thought of that when realising how long this week&rsquo;s video went for with no real plan other than to talk about our HIBP backlog. People seem to love this in the same way I loved listening to the guys a decade and a half ago. I&rsquo;ll do one of these with Stefan as well over the course of this month, let us know what you&rsquo;d like to hear about ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>This was a much longer than usual update, largely due to the amount of time spent discussing the Earth 2 incident. As I said in the video (many times!), the amount of attention this has garnered from both Earth 2 users and the company itself is incommensurate with the impact of the incident itself. It&rsquo;s a nothing-burger. Email addresses and usernames, that&rsquo;s it, and of course, their association with the service, which may lead to some very targeted spam or phishing attempts. It&rsquo;s still a breach by any reasonable definition of the term, but it should have been succinctly summarised and disclosed to impacted parties with everyone moving on with more important things in life a few moments later. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do right now ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>I have absolutely no problem at all talking about the code I&rsquo;ve screwed up. Perhaps that&rsquo;s partly because after 3 decades of writing software (and doing some meaningful stuff along the way), I&rsquo;m not particularly concerned about showing my weaknesses. And this week, I screwed up a bunch of stuff; database queries that weren&rsquo;t resilient to SQL database scale changes, partially completed breach notifications I didn&rsquo;t notice until it was too late to easily fix, and some queries that performed so badly they crashed the entire breach notification process after loading the massive DemandScience incident. Fortunately, none of them had any impact of note, we fixed them all and re-ran processes, and now we&rsquo;re more resilient than ever ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>I was going to write about how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; with the HIBP API, but somehow, that term doesn&rsquo;t really seem appropriate any more for a service of this scale. On the contrary, we&rsquo;re putting in huge amounts of effort to get this thing fast, stable, and sustainable. We could do the first two very easily just by throwing money at the cloud, but that makes the last one a bit hard. Besides, both StefÃ¡nÂ and I do enjoy the challenge of optimising an increasingly large system to run on a shoestring and even though the days of &ldquo;a coffee a day of running costs&rdquo; are well behind us, arguably the cost per request (or some other usage-based metric) is better than ever. I hope you enjoy this chat between the two of us and as I say in the video, do please chime in with your thoughts and suggestions.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is a list of my <em>favourite</em> breaches from this year as that&rsquo;s a bit of a disingenuous term, but oh boy were there some memorable ones. So many of the incidents I deal with are relatively benign in terms of either the data they expose or the nature of the service, but some of them this year were absolute zingers. This week, I&rsquo;m talking about the ones that really stuck out to me for one reason or another, here&rsquo;s the top 5:</p>

<p>A super quick intro today as I rush off to do the next very Dubai thing: drive a Lambo through the desert to go dirt bike riding before jumping in a Can-Am off-roader and then heading to the kart track for a couple of afternoon sessions. I post lots of pics to my Facebook account, and if none of that is interesting, here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s video on more infosec-related topics:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back in Oslo! Writing this the day after recording, it feels like I couldn&rsquo;t be further from Dubai; the temperature starts with a minus, it&rsquo;s snowing and there&rsquo;s not a supercar in sight.</p>
<p>Back on business, this week I&rsquo;m talking about the challenge of loading breaches and managing costs. A breach load immediately takes us from a very high percentage cache hit ratio on Cloudflare to zero. Consequently, our SQL costs skyrocket as the DB scales to support the load. Approximately 28 hours after loading the two breaches I mention in this week&rsquo;s update, we&rsquo;re still running a DB scale that&rsquo;s 350% larger than once we have a high cache hit ratio, and that <em>directly</em> hits my wallet. We need to work on this more because as I say in the video, I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t like financial incentives that influence how breaches are handled, such as delaying them and bulking them together to reduce the impact of cache flush events like this. We&rsquo;ll give that more thought, I think there are a few ways to tackle this. For now, here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s video and some of the challenges we&rsquo;re facing:</p>

<p>I fell waaay behind the normal video cadence this week, and I couldn&rsquo;t care less ðŸ˜Š I mean c&rsquo;mon, would you rather be working or sitting here looking at this view after snowboarding through Christmas?!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That said, Scott and I did carve out some time to chat about the, uh, &ldquo;colourful&rdquo; feedback he&rsquo;s had after finally putting a price on some Report URI features he&rsquo;d been giving away free for years. And there&rsquo;s more data breaches, of course, including a couple I loaded over the previous week that I think were particularly interesting. Enjoy this week&rsquo;s video, next week&rsquo;s will be a 2024 wrap-up from somewhere much, much sunnier ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a certain irony to the Bluesky situation where people are pushing back when I include links to X. Now, where have we seen this sort of behaviour before? ðŸ¤” When I&rsquo;m relying on content that only appears on that platform to add context to a data breach in HIBP <em>and</em> that content is freely accessible from within the native Bluesky app (without needing an X account), we&rsquo;re out of reasonable excuses for the negativity. And if &ldquo;because Elon&rdquo; is the sole reason and someone is firm enough in their convictions on that, there&rsquo;s a very easy solution ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Today, we&rsquo;re happy to welcome the 37th government to have full and free access to domain searches of their gov domains in Have I Been Pwned, Armenia. Armenia&rsquo;s National Computer Incident Response Team AM-CERT now joins three dozen other national counterparts in gaining visibility into how data breaches impact their national interests.</p>
