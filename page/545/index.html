</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the tl;dr - someone named &ldquo;Md. Shofiur R&rdquo; found troyhunt.com on a &ldquo;free online malware scanner&rdquo; and tried to scare me into believing my site had security vulnerabilities then shake me down for a penetration test. It didn&rsquo;t work out so well for him, here&rsquo;s the blow-by-blow account of things then I&rsquo;ll add some more thoughts afterwards:</p>

</p>
<p>For many years now, I&rsquo;ve lamented about how much of my time is spent attempting to disclose data breaches to impacted companies. It&rsquo;s by far the single most time-consuming activity in processing breaches for Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) and frankly, it&rsquo;s about the most thankless task I can imagine. Finding contact details is hard. Getting responses is hard. Not having an organisation just automatically assume you&rsquo;re trying to shake them down for cash is hard. So hard, in fact, I thought I&rsquo;d record the process end-to-end and share it publicly to help demonstrate just how painful the process is.</p>

</p>
<p>I have a vehement dislike for misleading advertising. We see it every day; weight loss pills, make money fast schemes and if you travel in the same circles I do, claims that extended validation (EV) certificates actually do something useful:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Someone had reached out to me privately and shared the offending page as they&rsquo;d taken issue with the false claims DigiCert was making. My views on certificate authority shenanigans spinning yarns on EV are well known after having done many talks on the topic and written many blog posts, most recently in August 2019 after both Chrome and Firefox announced they were killing it. When I say &ldquo;kill&rdquo;, that never meant that EV would no longer <em>technically</em> work, but it killed the single thing spruikers of it relied upon - being visually present beside the address bar. That was 2 and a half years ago, so why is DigiCert still pimping the message about the green bar with the company name? Beats me (although I could gue$$), but clearly DigiCert had a change of heart after that tweet because a day later, the offending image was gone. You can still see the original version in the Feb 9 snapshot on archive.org:</p>

</p>
<p>I decided to write this post because there&rsquo;s no concise way to explain the nuances of what&rsquo;s being described as one of the largest data breaches ever. Usually, it&rsquo;s easy to articulate a data breach; a service people provide their information to had someone snag it through an act of unauthorised access and publish a discrete corpus of information that can be attributed back to that source. But in the case of National Public Data, we&rsquo;re talking about a data aggregator most people had never heard of where a &ldquo;threat actor&rdquo; has published various <em>partial</em> sets of data with no clear way to attribute it back to the source. And they&rsquo;re already the subject of a class action, to add yet another variable into the mix. I&rsquo;ve been collating information related to this incident over the last couple of months, so let me talk about what&rsquo;s known about the incident, what data is circulating and what remains a bit of a mystery.</p>

</p>
<p>I hate having to use that word - &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; - because it&rsquo;s so inconclusive and I know it will leave people with many unanswered questions. (<strong>Edit:</strong> 12 days after publishing this blog post, it looks like the &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; caveat can be dropped, see the addition at the end of the post for more.) But sometimes, &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; is just where we need to begin and over the course of time, proper attribution is made and the dots are joined. We&rsquo;re here at &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; for two very simple reasons: one is that AT&amp;T is saying &ldquo;the data didn&rsquo;t come from us&rdquo;, and the other is that I have no way of proving otherwise. But I have proven, with sufficient confidence, that the data is real and the impact is significant. Let me explain:</p>
