<p>Today marks an important milestone for us with the first public release of our <strong>Kali Linux rolling distribution</strong>. Kali switched to a rolling release model back when we hit <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/">version 2.0</a></strong> (codename), however the rolling release was only available via an upgrade from 2.0 to kali-rolling for a select brave group. After 5 months of testing our rolling distribution (and its supporting infrastructure), we’re confident in its reliability - giving our users the best of all worlds - the stability of Debian, together with the latest versions of the many outstanding <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">penetration testing tools</a> created and shared by the information security community.</p>

Most of these mitigations rely on entropy (of varying degree) provided by the kernel, and are therefore supported by a separate random number generator known as the <strong>early_random()</strong> PRNG. As this generator is fundamental to the robustness of these mitigations, and has received additional improvements in iOS 7, it is unarguably a very interesting target that deserves further study.</p>

<p>Kali Linux 2.0 has been out for a couple of months and the response has been great, with well <strong>over a million unique downloads of Kali 2.0</strong> as a testament. Release day was somewhat hectic for us, as we did not anticipate the sheer volume of traffic … which we somehow always underestimate. In the first few days after the release of 2.0, we had <strong>ten times</strong> the download volume of 1.0 in a similar period, back in 2013.</p>

<p>After immersing myself for years and years in the world of finance (specifically, options market making and algorithmic trading), there was no escaping this mantra of “no risk, no reward.” Most of the time, my (trading) style was fairly risk-averse. I knew how to find the signals of opportunities among the daily noise to reap small rewards. Fortunately, I also learned how to think about the outliers and to take the occasional big but calculated risks.</p>
