<p>Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns or behaviors in system performance, application logs, or user interactions that deviate from expected norms. Detecting these anomalies in real time is crucial in a DevOps environment where speed, reliability, and continuous delivery are prioritized. Anomalies, if not detected promptly, can lead to system failures, performance degradation, or security breaches.</p>
<p>DevOps practices, which emphasize automation, continuous feedback, and collaboration, provide a solid foundation for integrating anomaly detection into every stage of the software development lifecycle. By leveraging DevOps tools and practices, teams can quickly identify and address anomalies before they impact the user experience or business operations. This post will explore how DevOps can be used for anomaly detection, its major features, and practical ways to implement it.</p>

<p>DevOps, a combination of development and operations practices, is primarily known for its impact on software development and IT infrastructure. However, its principles of collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery can also be applied to business operations. Integrating DevOps into business operations allows companies to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and deliver higher value to customers with greater speed and reliability.</p>
<p>This post will explore how DevOps can be used for business operations, highlighting its core features and the impact on improving efficiency, decision-making, and overall business agility.</p>

<p>Capacity management is the process of ensuring that an IT infrastructure can handle current and future workload demands. This involves monitoring, planning, and optimizing resources like servers, storage, and network bandwidth. In a DevOps environment, capacity management is essential for maintaining performance, scalability, and cost efficiency, particularly in cloud-native and containerized environments.</p>
<p>DevOps principles, such as automation, continuous monitoring, and collaboration, align perfectly with the goals of capacity management. By using DevOps practices to automate resource provisioning, monitor system health, and predict future needs, organizations can ensure that their infrastructure is always aligned with business requirements and user demands.</p>

<p>In any software development or DevOps environment, <strong>scope management</strong> (or descoping) is an essential part of ensuring that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and aligns with business objectives. Descoping involves adjusting the scope of a project—either by removing non-essential features, prioritizing key requirements, or shifting resources—to make sure the development process stays on track without sacrificing quality or user experience.</p>
<p>DevOps plays a significant role in <strong>descoping</strong> by leveraging its core principles: collaboration, automation, continuous feedback, and continuous delivery. These principles help DevOps teams quickly identify areas of scope that may not align with business goals or technical constraints, allowing them to make adjustments in real time without slowing down the development lifecycle. By embracing DevOps practices, teams can maintain agility and ensure that only the most valuable features make it to production.</p>

<p>IT Service Management (ITSM) focuses on the delivery and management of IT services to meet the needs of businesses and end-users. It includes processes like incident management, problem management, change management, and service request management. While ITSM ensures the quality and efficiency of IT services, <strong>DevOps</strong> emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Integrating DevOps into ITSM creates a synergy that enhances service delivery, automates key workflows, and accelerates the response to incidents and changes. DevOps principles can improve the efficiency of ITSM processes by enabling faster resolution times, proactive management of incidents, and better alignment of IT services with business needs. This post will explore how DevOps can be used to enhance ITSM, with a focus on its major features and practical implementation.</p>

<p>When storing large amounts of data, the cost ($) to store each gigabyte (GB) is the typical measure used to gauge the efficiency of the storage system. The biggest driver of storage cost is the protection method used.  It is common to protect data by either having multiple replicas within the storage system or by using erasure coding to create data chunks and parity chunks to reduce the raw storage consumed, albeit at the cost of higher CPU utilisation.</p>

<p>Hackers are distributing close to 1,000 web pages mimicking Reddit and the WeTransfer file sharing service that lead to downloading the Lumma Stealer malware.</p>
<p>On the fake pages, the threat actor is abusing the Reddit brand by showing a fake discussion thread on a specific topic. The thread creator asks for help to download a specific tool, another user offers to help by uploading it to WeTransfer and sharing the link, and a third thanks him to make everything appear legitimate.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Investment scams are a growing problem. Modern cybercriminals are increasingly using this technique to swindle money out of unsuspecting victims. It’s easy to understand why: investment scams are remarkably effective. Research from Barclays even found that they accounted for a staggering 33% of all money lost to scammers in 2023. It’s clear then that many people don’t know how to identify an investment scam. This is understandable, as techniques differ slightly from more traditional phishing scams and, in recent years, have become increasingly sophisticated. With this fact in mind, this&hellip;</p>

	<div>
		<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has proposed new rules requiring those under its jurisdiction to follow specific cyber risk management (CRM) requirements, report cybersecurity incidents in a certain timeframe, and address physical security concerns. This is positive news for the transportation industry, as hundreds of attacks have been leveled against the sector. These attacks have the potential to impact the supply chain, create chaos, and endanger human lives. TSA&rsquo;s notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) &ldquo;continues TSA&rsquo;s commitment to performance-based requirements and builds&hellip;</p>
