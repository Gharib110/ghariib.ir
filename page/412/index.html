		<p>As we look ahead to 2025, one thing is clear: the digital landscape is evolving quickly, and it’s creating new cybersecurity challenges for businesses globally. From the growing speed, scale and sophistication of cyberattacks to the changing nature of how we work and connect, the future of network security depends on a holistic approach that integrates advanced AI technologies and seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In fact, Palo Alto Networks 2025 Cybersecurity and AI Predictions showcase how we’re at a pivotal moment in the evolution of enterprise security practices. One of the standout predictions we made was that 2025 will be the year enterprises will widely adopt a secure browser. This trend is not only an inevitability, it’s a necessity. ​​While secure browsers will see a huge increase in adoption in the year ahead, they represent only one piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Privacy is many things for many people.</p>
<p>For the teenager suffering from a bad breakup, privacy is the ability to stop sharing her location and to block her ex on social media. For the political dissident advocating against an oppressive government, privacy is the protection that comes from secure, digital communications. And for the California resident who wants to know exactly how they’re being included in so many targeted ads, privacy is the legal right to ask a marketing firm how they collect their data.</p>

<p><em>Authored by Dexter Shin</em></p>
<p>Over the years, cyber threats targeting Android devices have become more sophisticated and persistent. Recently, McAfee Mobile Research Team discovered a new Android banking trojan targeting Indian users. This malware disguises itself as essential services, such as utility (e.g., gas or electricity) or banking apps, to get sensitive information from users. These types of services are vital for daily life, making it easier to lure users. We have previously observed malware that masquerades as utility services in Japan. As seen in such cases, utility-related messages, such as warnings that gas service will disconnect soon unless the bill is checked, can cause significant alarm and prompt immediate action from the users.</p>

		<p>While Exponential Organizations (ExOs) are transforming industries beyond the tech space, that doesn’t mean that they are not susceptible to an increasing number of cyber threats. As ExOs harness innovative and cutting-edge technologies to drive transformative growth, the ability to respond effectively and proactively to cyber incidents becomes increasingly vital. Recent statistics from the 2024 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report point to the global average cost being upwards of $4.88 million, with one in three organizations prone to a cyber attack.
