		<p>In a series of unsettling developments, Ticketmaster, the global ticket sales and distribution company, has once again fallen victim to a major cybersecurity breach. This time, hackers claim to have obtained barcode data for hundreds of thousands of tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and are demanding millions of dollars in ransom.

		<p>In a significant cybersecurity incident, the threat actor group known as ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a data breach involving Santander Bank, allegedly selling data for 30 million customers. This breach, disclosed two weeks after unauthorized access was detected, has been linked to recent hacks of Snowflake accounts, which also implicated Ticketmaster.</p>

<h4 id="shinyhunters-claims-santander-breach">ShinyHunters Claims Santander Breach</h4>
<p>On May 31, 2024, ShinyHunters announced they were selling a massive trove of data allegedly stolen from Santander Bank, including personal information for 30 million customers and employees. The data also reportedly contains 28 million credit card numbers and 6 million account numbers. This claim came shortly after Spain’s largest bank, Santander, reported a data breach affecting customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay.</p>

		<p>Harness the immense power of Git for your home projects.</p>
<p>Git is a fantastic version control system that every hobbyist and IT professional should be familiar with. While you could use a proprietary implementation like GitHub for your personal projects, you’re a bit limited in what functionality is available to you. In this guide, we’ll be covering how to set up Gitea, an open-source platform for self-hosting a Git repository. The reason why Gitea was chosen was simple: it’s lightweight, works in many environments, and is very simple to get up and running with.</p>

</p>
<p>When I started my career as an engineer in the early noughties, I was very keen on developer experience (devex).</p>
<p>So when I joined a company whose chosen language was TCL (no, really), I decided to ask the engineering mailing list what IDEs they used. Surely the senior engineers, with all their wisdom and experience, would tell which of the many IDEs available at the time made them the most productive? This was decades before ‘developer experience’ had a name, but nonetheless it was exactly what I was talking about, and what people fretted about.</p>
