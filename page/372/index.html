		<p>These are some of the best PC games history has to offer.</p>
<p>Struggling to find a PC game to play? It&rsquo;s no secret that games released today don&rsquo;t have as much magic as those from the 1990s and early 2000s. There are some excellent games from talented studios, but many fall short of what came before. So sit back, grab a beverage, and make some notes as I&rsquo;m going to run through a shortlist of classic PC games you can still play today on a desktop or laptop PC running Windows 11. This list is in alphabetical order.</p>

		<p>Get the thock you always wanted with these simple mods.</p>
<p>I absolutely love my mechanical keyboard. For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been using a Keychron K2 V2 with minor upgrades every now and then. Trust me when I say this &ndash; once you switch to a mechanical keyboard &ndash; there&rsquo;s no going back. There are a plethora of mechanical keyboards out there in the market that you can buy, or you could even build your own mechanical keyboard with custom parts. Regardless of which option you choose, the world of mechanical keyboards is a rabbit hole that keeps going deeper and deeper. What I mean to say is, that you can keep upgrading or modding your keyboard with time to make it even better.</p>

		<p>This browser will make you ditch Chrome in 2025</p>
<p>With Chrome dominating the web market, alongside new entrants like Vivaldi and Arc grabbing the headlines, it’s easy to forget the browser that once ruled the internet: Firefox. Mozilla has been quietly evolving Firefox, and it is now packed with a surprising number of features that make it a compelling alternative to the mainstream. Before you dismiss it as a thing of the past, check out these reasons why Firefox might just be the browser you need in 2025.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we held our inaugural Pwn2Own Automotive contest, and it was a rousing success. On our biggest-ever stage (literally), we awarded $1,323,750 over the three-day event as researchers from around the globe demonstrated 49 unique zero days. Today, we’re excited to announce that we will be returning to Tokyo and the Automotive World conference for Pwn2Own Automotive 2025. The event will be held on January 22-24, 2025, and we have some exciting challenges planned for our second year.</p>
