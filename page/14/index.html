	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hardly a day goes by without a policy announcement or public statement by President Trump that betrays a nationalist instinct. The first problem with nationalism is semantics. People tend to confuse it with patriotism, a deeply felt emotion that a nationalist can easily stir with a discourse that equates love of country with hostility to the outside world and, domestically, to those presented as a threat to the nation. </p>
<p>Economic nationalists often emphasize the need to protect the nation from perceived threats rather than focusing on the alleged economic advantages of their policies. They argue that foreign countries are taking advantage of us or that a competitor’s dominance in areas like science, technology, or industry is an affront to our nation’s greatness. The latter can be seen when Trump points to Taiwan’s leadership in the chip industry. Taiwan’s leadership is only admissible if its companies make their semiconductors in the U.S.—under threat of reprisals if they don’t.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Mar. 7, 2025</p>
<p>Forbes Technology Council Member Aliasgar Dohadwala points out that for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the consequences of ransomware can be catastrophic, with 60 percent of small businesses shutting their doors within six months of a major cyberattack, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.</p>
<p>Why are SMEs targeted? Dohadwala, a Board Member at the Dubai Chamber of Commerce Cybersecurity Group, offers 3 reasons in his Forbes article:</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Two weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that the U.K. government had issued a secret order to Apple demanding that the company include a “backdoor” into the company’s end-to-end encrypted iCloud Backup feature. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The British government’s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. Its application would mark a significant defeat for tech companies in their decades-long battle to avoid being wielded as government tools against their users, the people said, speaking under the condition of anonymity to discuss legally and politically sensitive issues.</p>

<p>The complexity of cloud environments means that there is a virtually infinite list of potential security risks and vulnerabilities that could arise within cloud infrastructure or workloads. That said, some cloud security threats are more prevalent than others – and knowing which risks and vulnerabilities are trending is key to knowing what to prioritize when managing the attack surface for your organization. To that end, this article details seven of the most prominent cloud threats and vulnerabilities that emerged in 2024, including several discovered by Aqua researchers.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>After a little more than a month back in the White House in 2025, Donald Trump’s presidency has already left a profound mark on the U.S. economy, reigniting debates over tariffs, inflation, unemployment, and the broader economic trajectory. His return was heralded by promises of revitalizing American industry, curbing inflation, and restoring economic dominance. However, the reality of his first 40 days paints a more complex picture, shaped by inherited challenges, aggressive policy shifts, and a global economy less forgiving than in his previous term.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>President Trump entered the Oval Office like a tornado, signing more executive orders in his first two weeks than any president has signed in his first 100 days since President Harry Truman. His America First agenda will reshape trade and foreign policy, ushering in a new protectionist era. His imposition of tariffs, and bluster in wanting to make Canada the 51st state, has not only increased Canada’s anxiety level but revived the political fortunes of the country’s left-leaning Liberal establishment. A recent Leger poll found that 75 percent of Canadians view President Trump negatively and 13 percent view him favorably. This has galvanized Canadians around the Liberal Party, stealing support from the socialist NDP and the Conservatives who have lost their big lead in the polls.</p>
