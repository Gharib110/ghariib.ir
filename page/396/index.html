<p>In part 2, I describe the <code>ApprovedApplicationCollection</code> gadget, which was available for abuse because it did not appear on the deny list and could therefore be accessed via <code>MultiValuedProperty</code>. I am also presenting a path traversal in the Windows utility <code>extrac32.exe</code>, which allowed me to complete the chain for a full RCE in Exchange. For the moment, at least, Microsoft has made a decision not to fix this path traversal bug.</p>

<p>This guide explains configuring Fluentd to extract structured data from unstructured log messages using the parser plugin with a regular expression (regexp). If you need to extract specific fields, such as log_source and index, from a log message, you can do this as follows.</p>
<p>Input Log:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
{
  &#34;message&#34;: &#34;Log source &#39;WinCollect DSM - SRV-AD-001&#39; has stopped emitting events&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>Configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;filter **&gt;
  @type parser
  key_name message
  reserve_data true
  &lt;parse&gt;
    @type regexp
    expression /&#39;(?&lt;log_source&gt;[^&#39;]+)s-s(?&lt;index&gt;[^&#39;]+)&#39;/
  &lt;/parse&gt;

		<p>This blog post highlights two additional vulnerabilities in the Autel Maxicharger that were exploited at Pwn2Own Automotive 2024. Details of the patches are also included.</p>
<p>Autel has been informed and has deployed a firmware update (v1.35) to address both of these issues. If you want to read about other Autel bugs reported at Pwn2Own, you check out our earlier blog here.</p>
<p><strong>The First Vulnerability: CVE-2024-23967 (ZDI-CAN-23230)</strong></p>
<p>Researchers from Computest Sector 7 identified and exploited a stack-based buffer overflow in v1.32 of the Autel firmware. This vulnerability stems from the decoding of base64 encoded data that can be controlled by an attacker. The encoded data is decoded into a fixed-size stack buffer with no bounds checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In a concerning development within cybersecurity, attackers have been leveraging DocuSign’s API capabilities to send out fraudulent invoices that closely mimic genuine documents. These campaigns have been rising in frequency, with reports over the past five months highlighting a significant uptick in incidents. In the context of cybersecurity, the abuse of DocuSign’s API represents a significant shift away from traditional phishing methods. Conventional phishing attacks typically involve sending spoofed emails that mimic trusted brands to trick victims into clicking malicious links or entering sensitive data, such as login credentials. Email and anti-spam filters have evolved to detect and block these deceptive tactics effectively, making it more difficult for attackers to succeed using traditional methods.</p>

		<p>In a series of unsettling developments, Ticketmaster, the global ticket sales and distribution company, has once again fallen victim to a major cybersecurity breach. This time, hackers claim to have obtained barcode data for hundreds of thousands of tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and are demanding millions of dollars in ransom. This latest attack underscores a worrying trend of increasing sophistication and audacity in cybercrime targeting major corporations.</p>
