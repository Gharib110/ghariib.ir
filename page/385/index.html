<hr>
<p>Given the pace of Amazon Web Services (AWS) innovation, it can be challenging to stay up to date on the latest AWS service and feature launches. AWS provides services and tools to help you protect your data, accounts, and workloads from unauthorized access. AWS data protection services provide encryption capabilities, key management, and sensitive data discovery. Last year, we saw growth and evolution in AWS data protection services as we continue to give customers features and controls to help meet their needs. Protecting data in the AWS Cloud is a top priority because we know you trust us to help protect your most critical and sensitive asset: your data. This post will highlight some of the key AWS data protection launches in the last year that security professionals should be aware of.</p>

	<div>
		<p>When tracking adversaries, we commonly focus on the malware they employ in the final stages of the kill chain and infrastructure, often overlooking samples used in the initial ones.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore some ideas to track adversary activity leveraging images and artifacts mostly used during delivery. We presented this approach at the FIRST CTI in Berlin and at Botconf in Nice.</p>
<h1 id="hunting-early">Hunting early</h1>
<p>In threat hunting and detection engineering activities, analysts typically focus heavily on the latter stages of the kill chain – from execution to actions on objectives (Figure 1). This is mainly because there is more information available about adversaries in these phases, and it&rsquo;s easier to search for clues using endpoint detection and response (EDR), security information and event management (SIEM), and other solutions.</p>

		<p>In the constantly changing world of cybersecurity, generative AI is becoming an increasingly valuable tool. This blog post shows various examples that elude traditional detection engines yet are adeptly unveiled by Code Insight. We explore diverse scenarios, ranging from firmware patches in DJI drones that disable red flight lights, to the covert theft of WhatsApp session cookies, phishing targeting Tesla customers, automated login attempts on the Medtronic CareLink Network, Bitcoin wallet attacks, Tik-Tok viewbots, unauthorized Netflix account access, cheaters for Roblox, and automation of Tinder’s match-making, along with a range of other scenarios.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Bitdefender researchers investigated a series of incidents at high-level organizations in countries of the South China Sea region, all performed by the same  threat actor we track as Unfading Sea Haze. Based on the victimology and the cyber-attack’s aim, we believe the threat actor is aligned with China’s interests. As tensions in the region rise, they are reflected in the intensification of activity on behalf of the Unfading Sea Haze actor, which uses new and improved tools and TTPs.</p>

	<b><time>05.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>VirusTotal has incorporated a powerful new tool to fight against malware: <strong>JA4 client fingerprinting</strong>. This feature allows security researchers to track and identify malicious files based on the unique characteristics of their TLS client communications.</p>
<h3 id="ja4-a-more-robust-successor-to-ja3">JA4: A More Robust Successor to JA3</h3>
<p>JA4, developed by FoxIO, represents a significant advancement over the older JA3 fingerprinting method. JA3&rsquo;s effectiveness had been hampered by the increasing use of TLS extension randomization in https clients, which made fingerprints less consistent. JA4 was specifically designed to be resilient to this randomization, resulting in more stable and reliable fingerprints.</p>
