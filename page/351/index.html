		<p>The School of Engineering welcomes 15 new faculty members across six of its academic departments. This new cohort of faculty members, who have either recently started their roles at MIT or will start within the next year, conduct research across a diverse range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Many of these new faculty specialize in research that intersects with multiple fields. In addition to positions in the School of Engineering, a number of these faculty have positions at other units across MIT. Faculty with appointments in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) report into both the School of Engineering and the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing. This year, new faculty also have joint appointments between the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the School of Science.</p>

		<p>Written by ARC Labs contributors, John Dwyer, Eric Gonzalez at Binary Defense and Tyler Hudak at TrustedSec In cybersecurity, the threats we don’t see—or don’t expect—often pose the greatest danger. Recently, this became all too clear when three unmanaged AIX servers, sitting exposed on the internet, opened the door for a China-Nexus Threat Actor to launch an […]</p>

<p>Germanium. It might sound like just another periodic table entry (number 32, to be exact), but in the world of infrared light, it’s anything but ordinary. A recent video by [The Action Lab] dives into the fascinating property of germanium being transparent to infrared light. This might sound like sci-fi jargon, but it’s a real phenomenon that can be easily demonstrated with nothing more than a flashlight and a germanium coin. If you want to see how that looks, watch the video on how it’s done.</p>

<p>According to [ClassicHasClass], the best way to open an Atari Stacy is to not open an Atari Stacy. Apparently, these old computers were not pleasant to work on. The cables were not keyed and were prone to short against things. Screws easily strip out plastic holes. Of course, there wouldn’t be a story if there wasn’t a teardown and an upgrade that you can check out in the post.</p>

		<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Establishing persistence on a system allows a threat actor continued access or process execution across system restarts or other changes. For this reason, monitoring for and investigating persistence indicators are key components of any robust cybersecurity platform.</p>
<p>Two common persistence techniques are using AutoStart Execution of programs during system boot or logon (T1547) and abusing scheduled task functions (T1053). However, legitimate application activity also frequently involves AutoStart Execution and scheduled task functions, so defending against these techniques requires not only detection monitoring but also analysis by a cybersecurity professional. </p>

<p>It all started with a behemoth of a Next.js application. <strong>15,000 files, 107,000 lines of code, and a staggering 18,000 unit tests.</strong> This was the beast we inherited at Leboncoin.fr, and its CI pipeline was, to put it mildly, a bit of a nightmare.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-a-50-minute-wait-and-growing">The Problem: A 50-Minute Wait (and Growing!)</h2>
<p>Our initial encounter with the CI process was less than ideal. Average build times were hovering around <strong>50 minutes</strong>, with some builds dragging on for <strong>2 hours</strong>.</p>

		<p>Academic digital credentials — the cryptographically verifiable assertion that an individual holds a degree, certificate, or other credential — have been available for the better part of a decade. Yet despite the potential value of these data-rich, transportable credentials to graduates, employers, and academic institutions, digital credentials have by no means become the standard in presenting or verifying skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>A new report from the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), housed at MIT Open Learning, explores this gap between the promise of digital credentials and their widespread adoption.</p>
