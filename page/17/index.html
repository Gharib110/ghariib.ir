	<div>
		<p>The emergence of containerization has brought about a significant transformation in software development and deployment by providing a consistent and scalable environment on many platforms. For developers trying to optimize their operations, Docker in particular has emerged as the preferred technology.  By using containers as the foundation, developers gain the same key benefits — portability, scalability, efficiency, and security — that they rely on for other workloads, seamlessly extending them to ML and AI applications. Using a real-world example involving a Snake AI game, we’ll examine in this article how TensorFlow.js can be used with Docker to run AI/ML in a web browser.</p>

<p>As a platform engineer at a mid-size startup, I’m responsible for identifying bottlenecks and developing solutions to streamline engineering operations to keep up with the velocity and scale of the engineering organization. In this post, I outline some of the challenges we faced with one of our clients, how we addressed them, and provide guides on how to tackle these challenges at your company.</p>

	<div>
		<p>At Docker, we are committed to ensuring that Docker Hub remains the best place for developers, engineering teams, and operations teams to build, share, and collaborate. As part of this, we previously announced plans to introduce image pull consumption fees and storage-based billing. After further evaluating how developers use Docker Hub and what will best support the ecosystem, we have refined our approach—one that prioritizes developer experience and enables developers to scale with confidence while reinforcing Docker Hub as the foundation of the cloud-native ecosystem.</p>
