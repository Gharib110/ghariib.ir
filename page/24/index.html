<p>In a stark reminder of the growing threat posed by hacktivist groups, the pro-Palestinian Dark Storm Team has taken credit for a major distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on X (formerly Twitter). This attack underscores the vulnerability of even the most well-established digital platforms to sophisticated, politically motivated cyber threats. With online platforms playing an increasingly crucial role in global communication, the attack on X is part of a larger campaign of cyber aggression targeting critical infrastructure, government agencies, and major corporations. But who is the Dark Storm Team, and why should organizations worldwide take notice? Who is the Dark Storm […]</p>

		<p>Researchers crack macOS ransomware encryption, USBs pose increased risk to critical infrastructure, and 15bn stolen credentials are for sale on the DarkNet.</p>
<p>The post Das Gute, das Schlechte und das Hässliche in der Cybersicherheit – Woche 28 appeared first on SentinelOne DE.</p>
<h2 id="das-gute"><strong>Das Gute</strong></h2>
<p>In dieser Woche wurde ein großer Business Email Compromise-Betrugsversuch abgewehrt, der sich gegen Office 365 richtete. BEC oder Email Account Compromises waren im vergangenen Jahr für den größten Anteil der Datenverluste durch Cyberkriminalität verantwortlich. Die Betrüger nutzten die COVID-19-Pandemie als Köder und leiteten den Phishing-Datenverkehr über sechs Internetdomänen, wobei sie über schädliche Webanwendungen an die Anmeldedaten der Office 365-Konten ihrer Opfer gelangten.</p>

A big update to the perennially popular GNOME Shell extension Dash to Panel is rolling out, including new settings to go from Dash to Panel to dock mode! Admittedly, that doesn’t sound like a new feature given that Dash to Panel is based on code from Dash to Dock. Yet, until now, those wanting the unified panel of Dash to Panel with the aesthetic of a dock… Had to make do with an inelegant fudge, or switch extension. No more; when whim and want demands a dynamic dock setup, Dash to Panel’s preferences area can help, making it easier to […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Remediation has long been a sore spot in data security posture management (DSPM). Many of the currently available solutions are great at surfacing alerts but offer no real way for Security teams to take action without a separate effort to integrate with external remediation tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce a new and ready-to-use integration between Prisma Cloud DSPM and Cortex XSOAR. This latest development allows organizations to automatically remediate data security risks (or initiate relevant remediation workflows) and to easily incorporate data security risks, policies and classifications into new and existing remediation playbooks. For Palo Alto Networks, this represents another step toward our vision of further platformization in cloud security.</p>

<p>The internet is brimming with content designed to entertain, inform—and sometimes deceive. The latest tool in a cybercriminal’s arsenal? Deepfakes. From fabricated celebrity endorsements to fraudulent job interviews, AI-generated deepfake scams are growing at an alarming rate. As deepfake technology becomes more advanced, it’s harder than ever to discern real from fake—until it’s too late. </p>
<p>According to McAfee’s latest “State of the Scamiverse” report, deepfake scams have become an everyday reality. The average American now encounters 2.6 deepfake videos daily, with younger adults (18-24) seeing even more – about 3.5 per day. And for less than the cost of a latte and in under 10 minutes, scammers today can create shockingly convincing deepfake videos of anyone: your mom, your boss, or even your child.</p>

		<p>Day One is now available on Windows and anyone can try it for free.</p>
<p>Journal apps on digital platforms are fairly popular, especially among people who want to keep a digitized record of their lives. A couple of years ago, Apple announced its built-in <strong>Journal</strong> app for iOS, entering a competitive market which already features the likes of Everlog, Obsidian, and Day One. If you&rsquo;re a customer of the last app mentioned in this list, you&rsquo;ll be happy to hear that the digital journal has now made its way to Windows.</p>

		<p>This is a cryptography blog and I always feel the need to apologize for any post that isn’t “straight cryptography.” I’m actually getting a little tired of apologizing for it (though if you want some hard-core cryptography content, there’s plenty here and here.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to remind my colleagues that out in the real world, our job is not to solve exciting mathematical problems: <em>it’s to help people communicate securely</em>. And people, at this very moment, need a lot of help. Many of my friends are Federal employees or work for contractors, and they’re terrified that they’re going to lose their job based on speech they post online. Unfortunately, “online” to many people includes thoughts sent over private text messages — so even private conversations are becoming chilled. And while this is hardly the worst thing happening to people in this world, it’s something that’s happening to my friends and neighbors.</p>
