		<p>As you may know, I recently presented my Exchange-related talk during OffensiveCon 2024. This series of 4 blog posts is meant to supplement the talk and provide additional technical details.</p>
<p>In this final part, I ’am going to describe the PowerShell Remoting <code>ConvertViaNoArgumentConstructor</code> conversion mechanism, which I underestimated at the beginning of my research. It allowed me to find 3 more vulnerabilities, even after the Exchange PowerShell attack surface had been significantly hardened by switching to a strict allow list of types. The vulnerabilities I found were:</p>

<p>This guide explains configuring Fluentd to extract structured data from unstructured log messages using the parser plugin with a regular expression (regexp). If you need to extract specific fields, such as log_source and index, from a log message, you can do this as follows.</p>
<p>Input Log:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
{
  &#34;message&#34;: &#34;Log source &#39;WinCollect DSM - SRV-AD-001&#39; has stopped emitting events&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>Configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;filter **&gt;
  @type parser
  key_name message
  reserve_data true
  &lt;parse&gt;
    @type regexp
    expression /&#39;(?&lt;log_source&gt;[^&#39;]+)s-s(?&lt;index&gt;[^&#39;]+)&#39;/
  &lt;/parse&gt;

		<p>This blog post highlights two additional vulnerabilities in the Autel Maxicharger that were exploited at Pwn2Own Automotive 2024. Details of the patches are also included.</p>
<p>Autel has been informed and has deployed a firmware update (v1.35) to address both of these issues. If you want to read about other Autel bugs reported at Pwn2Own, you check out our earlier blog here.</p>
<p><strong>The First Vulnerability: CVE-2024-23967 (ZDI-CAN-23230)</strong></p>
<p>Researchers from Computest Sector 7 identified and exploited a stack-based buffer overflow in v1.32 of the Autel firmware. This vulnerability stems from the decoding of base64 encoded data that can be controlled by an attacker. The encoded data is decoded into a fixed-size stack buffer with no bounds checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.</p>

		<p>In a concerning development within cybersecurity, attackers have been leveraging DocuSign’s API capabilities to send out fraudulent invoices that closely mimic genuine documents. These campaigns have been rising in frequency, with reports over the past five months highlighting a significant uptick in incidents. In the context of cybersecurity, the abuse of DocuSign’s API represents a significant shift away from traditional phishing methods. Conventional phishing attacks typically involve sending spoofed emails that mimic trusted brands to trick victims into clicking malicious links or entering sensitive data, such as login credentials. Email and anti-spam filters have evolved to detect and block these deceptive tactics effectively, making it more difficult for attackers to succeed using traditional methods.</p>

		<p>In a series of unsettling developments, Ticketmaster, the global ticket sales and distribution company, has once again fallen victim to a major cybersecurity breach. This time, hackers claim to have obtained barcode data for hundreds of thousands of tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and are demanding millions of dollars in ransom. This latest attack underscores a worrying trend of increasing sophistication and audacity in cybercrime targeting major corporations.</p>

		<p>In a significant cybersecurity incident, the threat actor group known as ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a data breach involving Santander Bank, allegedly selling data for 30 million customers. This breach, disclosed two weeks after unauthorized access was detected, has been linked to recent hacks of Snowflake accounts, which also implicated Ticketmaster.</p>

<h4 id="shinyhunters-claims-santander-breach">ShinyHunters Claims Santander Breach</h4>
<p>On May 31, 2024, ShinyHunters announced they were selling a massive trove of data allegedly stolen from Santander Bank, including personal information for 30 million customers and employees. The data also reportedly contains 28 million credit card numbers and 6 million account numbers. This claim came shortly after Spain’s largest bank, Santander, reported a data breach affecting customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay.</p>

		<p>Harness the immense power of Git for your home projects.</p>
<p>Git is a fantastic version control system that every hobbyist and IT professional should be familiar with. While you could use a proprietary implementation like GitHub for your personal projects, you’re a bit limited in what functionality is available to you. In this guide, we’ll be covering how to set up Gitea, an open-source platform for self-hosting a Git repository. The reason why Gitea was chosen was simple: it’s lightweight, works in many environments, and is very simple to get up and running with.</p>
