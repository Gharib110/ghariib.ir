	<div>
		<p>This is no secret, online criminals are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in their malicious schemes. While AI tends to be abused to trick people (i.e. deepfakes) in order to gain something, sometimes, it is meant to defeat computer security programs.</p>
<p>With AI, this process has just become easier and we are seeing more and more cases of fake content produced for deception purposes. In the criminal underground, web pages or sites that are meant to be decoys are sometimes called “white pages,” as opposed to the “black pages” (malicious landing pages).</p>

		<p>At GitLab we have a tradition: Every year, we invite a bug bounty hunter to join us for an AMA. This year, we met with Alexander Siyou Tan, also known as ahacker1, and did a deep dive into all aspects of bug bounty hunting.</p>
<h2 id="about-alexander-ahacker1">About Alexander (ahacker1)</h2>
<p>Alexander is passionate about hacking complex SaaS applications, with a particular interest in authorization-based vulnerabilities. Currently, he&rsquo;s focusing on SAML and SSO research. His hacking journey began during the Covid-19 pandemic, when he transitioned from gaming to exploring game hacks and easter eggs.</p>

		<p>The first part of our three-part series on test generation with GitLab Duo focused on how to automate code testing. Now, we will share the lessons we learned while using AI for test generation.</p>
<h2 id="situations-we-encountered-and-how-we-handled-them">Situations we encountered and how we handled them</h2>
<p>Overall, we were pleased with the results using GitLab Duo to generate tests on our code. As is the case with any language generation, some cases required minor adjustments such as fixing import paths or editing contents in datasets. For the more complex cases, we had to remember that AI solutions often lack context. Here&rsquo;s how we handled the more complex testing situations with GitLab Duo.</p>

We also shared some of the ways we addressed making changes to GitLab Duo generated tests. This last article in the series will cover a test we ran to validate the impact of GitLab Duo on our team’s automated testing and discuss the impressive results we have achieved thus far.</p>

<p>Today, our most sensitive information is generally encrypted — from your personal messages, banking and health information to things like classified military documents and companies&rsquo; trade secrets.</p>
<p>But there’s a growing threat looming over our collective privacy and security — and that’s quantum computing. Currently being developed by the largest tech companies, startups and governments alike, quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations faster than today’s computers.</p>
