<p>Unicode-related vulnerabilities have seen an increase in momentum in the past year. Last year, a Black Hat presentation by Jonathan Birch detailed how character normalization NFC/NFKC can lead to glitches in URL and host manipulation. Recently, two vulnerabilities were found in password reset functionality. The two affected applications were Django and Github. In the previous blog post, we have presented API transforming code points with potential side effects. In this post, we present one of our findings: a vulnerability affecting Oracle JDK and Open JDK host verification in the TLS communication. We are also including details from a similar weakness in Apache HTTP client.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m honest, I was in two minds about adding additional stealer logs to HIBP. Even with the new feature to include the domains an email address appears against in the logs, my concern was that I&rsquo;d get a barrage of &ldquo;that&rsquo;s useless information&rdquo; messages like I normally do when I load stealer logs! Instead, the feedback was resoundingly positive. This week I&rsquo;m talking more about the logic behind this, some of the challenges we faced with it and what we might see in the future. Stay tuned, because I think we&rsquo;re going to be seeing a lot more of this in HIBP.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Double extortion</strong> is an advanced ransomware tactic where attackers not only encrypt a victim&rsquo;s data to demand a ransom for decryption but also steal the data and threaten to release or sell it publicly if the ransom isn’t paid. Talk about salt in a wound, this one is the worst. </p>

		<p>Did you know that <strong>Uniswap</strong>, one of the most popular decentralized exchanges, was conceived during an Ethereum hackathon? Founder Hayden Adams developed the first version of Uniswap at ETH NewYork in 2018. Fast forward to 2025, and hackathons such as Compound and Polygon continue to serve as launchpads for groundbreaking innovations. These events are where revolutionary ideas take shape!</p>
<p>But hackathons aren’t just for experienced developers—they’re also perfect for beginners. Whether you’re attending your first hackathon to learn, build, or network, 2025 is the perfect year to get started. This guide will help you prepare for your first hackathon, navigate the event, and maximize the exciting opportunities these events offer.</p>

		<p>In a disturbing number of incidents in recent years, local governments have withheld critical services, resulting in destruction and death. Consider, for example, the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, 2022.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officers waited for 77 minutes inside Robb Elementary School before confronting and killing the active shooter who murdered 21 people—19 children and two teachers—and trapped 36 people in a room, many of whom were shot and dying. In the final incident review by the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Merrick Garland called the law enforcement response “a failure,” but “criminal” is likely more accurate. Two of the responding officers will go on trial in Texas in October 2025.</p>

		<p>Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, agile, and fast. For managed service providers (MSPs) supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with cybersecurity services, staying ahead of these adversaries is crucial. One of the most effective ways to do so is through round-the-clock threat hunting.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll explore why constant threat hunting is essential, the challenges MSPs face in providing it, and how OpenText MDR can help overcome these challenges while offering SMBs the protection they need.</p>

		<p>The idea of artificial intelligence (AI) is not new, but recent advancements in related technologies have turned it from something more hypothetical-than-real to a tool that many of us use every day. The growing importance and proliferation of AI is at once exciting and potentially alarming as the foundations of many AI tools are essentially black boxes owned and controlled by a small number of powerful corporations.At Red Hat we believe that everyone should have the ability to contribute to AI. AI innovation shouldn&rsquo;t be restricted to companies that can afford massive amounts of processing po</p>

		<p><em>Am I Racist?</em>, Matt Walsh’s searing attack on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, dominated the documentary film box office in 2024. Screening in 1,600 theaters at its height, the film earned $12.3 million before streaming on the Daily Wire. Walsh’s film grossed more at the box office than any other documentary since 2019. That’s when Peter Jackson’s artistically boundary-pushing World War I film <em>They Shall Not Grow Old</em> brought in $12.2 million. </p>

		<p>Containers are an important part of modern computing, for hosting, for application development, and even as an alternative to virtualization. The infrastructure supporting containers has been refined and developed since the early days, so if you&rsquo;ve been holding off on adopting containers, you might be pleasantly surprised at how easy the daemonless Podman engine makes it to build, run, and manage containers and pods.Containers interface directly with Linux kernel abilities like cgroups and namespaces. Running a container literally uses your existing kernel to run additional Linux systems insid</p>
