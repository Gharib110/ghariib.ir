		<p>Job Posting: <strong>Researcher in Cryptographic Protocols and Key Exchange</strong><br>
<em>Technology Innovation Institute (TII), Abu Dhabi, UAE</em></p>
<p>We are looking for a permanent researcher to join the Cryptographic Protocols team within the Cryptography Research Center (CRC) at TII. The main task of the team is to conduct applied academic research and assist in product development, spanning topics such as: TLS, QUIC, Tor, Key Exchange, secure channels, cryptographic primitives and their implementation, privacy enhancing technologies, MLS and Secure Messaging, WebRTC, and formal methods. The nature of our work spans both theory and practice, covering aspects such as provable security, security models, efficient designs, implementation aspects, and attacks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Shadowfax: Combiners for Deniability</strong><br>
<em>Phillip Gajland, Vincent Hwang, Jonas Janneck</em></p>
<p>As cryptographic protocols transition to post-quantum security, most adopt hybrid solutions combining pre-quantum and post-quantum assumptions. However, this shift often introduces trade-offs in terms of efficiency, compactness, and in some cases, even security. One such example is deniability, which enables users, such as journalists or activists, to deny authorship of potentially incriminating messages. While deniability was once mainly of theoretical interest, protocols like X3DH, used in Signal and WhatsApp, provide it to billions of users. Recent work (Collins et al., PETS'25) has further bridged the gap between theory and real-world applicability. In the post-quantum setting, however, protocols like PQXDH, as well as others such as Apple’s iMessage with PQ3, do not support deniability. This work investigates how to preserve deniability in the post-quantum setting by leveraging unconditional (statistical) guarantees instead of computational assumptions - distinguishing deniability from confidentiality and authenticity.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>TallyGuard: Privacy Preserving Tallied-as-cast Guarantee</strong><br>
<em>Athish Pranav Dharmalingam, Sai Venkata Krishnan, KC Sivaramakrishnan, N.S. Narayanaswamy</em></p>
<p>This paper presents a novel approach to verifiable vote tallying using additive homomorphism, which can be appended to existing voting systems without modifying the underlying infrastructure. Existing End-to-End Verifiable (E2E-V) systems like Belenios and ElectionGuard rely on distributed trust models or are vulnerable to decryption compromises, making them less suitable for general elections. Our approach introduces a tamper-evident commitment to votes through cryptographic hashes derived from homomorphic encryption schemes such as Paillier. The proposed system provides tallied-as-cast verifiability without revealing individual votes, thereby preventing coercion. The system also provides the ability to perform public verification of results. We also show that this system can be transitioned to quantum-secure encryption like Regev for future-proofing the system. We discuss how to deploy this system in a real-world scenario, including for general political elections, analyzing the security implications and report on the limitations of this system. We believe that the proposed system offers a practical solution to the problem of verifiable vote tallying in general elections.</p>

Want to find out if the text you’re reading online was written by an real human or spat out by a large language model (LLM) trying to sound like one? Mozilla’s Fakespot Deepfake Detector Firefox add-on may can help give you an indication. Similar to online AI detector tools, the add-on can analyse text (of 32 words or more) to identify patterns, traits, and tells common in AI generated or manipulated text. It uses Mozilla’s proprietary ApolloDFT engine and a set of open-source detection models. But unlike some tools, Mozilla’s Fakespot Deepfake Detector browser extension is free to use, does […]</p>

		<p>The notorious WantToCry ransomware group leverages misconfigured Server Message Block (SMB) services to infiltrate networks and launch widespread attacks.</p>
<p>The weaknesses in SMBs, such as weak credentials, outdated software, and poor security configurations, are providing attackers with an easy entry point through which attackers exploit publicly exposed network drives and NAS (Network-Attached Storage) devices.</p>
<p>Once inside, cybercriminals can move laterally across networks, escalate privileges, and deploy malicious payloads that encrypt critical files, crippling organizations.</p>

<p>What’s the only thing cooler than building something electronic? That’s right — wearing it proudly for all to see.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re not into wearables. Maybe it’s because you’re afraid of sewing, or simply scared that you won’t be able to launder that blinkenshirt you’ve always wanted to make. Well, the undisputed queen of wearables — [Becky Stern] — has a bunch of beginner tips for making DIY wearables. She’s created dozens and dozens of wearable projects and matching tutorials over the years and has graced these pages many times.</p>
