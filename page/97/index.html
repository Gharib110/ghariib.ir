		<p>Last month, Henry Farrell and I convened the Third Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (IWORD 2024) at Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs Bloomberg Center in Washington DC. This is a small, invitational workshop on the future of democracy. As with the previous two workshops, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of political scientists, law professors, philosophers, AI researchers and other industry practitioners, political activists, and creative types (including science fiction writers) to discuss how democracy might be reimagined in the current century&hellip;</p>

	<div>
		<p>After TikTok was briefly banned in the US last weekend, an unusual phenomenon unearthed. Reportedly, people are selling iPhones that have TikTok installed for up to $25,000.</p>
<p>This may require some explanation, so bear with me.</p>
<p>TikTok has had a rough time in the US the last weeks. The ban we mentioned originates from back in March, when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would effectively ban TikTok from the US unless Chinese owner ByteDance agreed to give up its share of the immensely popular app.</p>

<p>Wine, the popular free open-source compatibility layer for running Windows apps/games in Linux/Unix, announced new 10.0 major release on Tuesday!</p>
<p>The new release features <strong>Hi-DPI scaling</strong> support. Instead of exposing high-DPI sizes to applications that don‚Äôt expect it, it now automatically scale non-DPI aware windows.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Wine 10.0 also added <strong>fully support for ARM64EC</strong>, Microsoft‚Äôs API for applications running on Arm devices with Windows 11. As well as fully hybrid ARM64X modules support, allowing to mix ARM64EC and plain ARM64 code into a single binary. However, ARM64 support requires the Kernel page size to be 4K.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find a good criminal these days. I mean a really trustworthy one you can be confident won&rsquo;t lead you up the garden path with false promises of data breaches. Like this guy yesterday:</p>

<p>For my international friends, JB Hi-Fi is a massive electronics retailer down under <em>and they have my data!</em> I mean by design because I&rsquo;ve bought a bunch of stuff from them, so I was curious not just about my own data but because a breach of 12 million plus people would be massive in a country of not much more than double that. So, I dropped the guy a message and asked if he&rsquo;d be willing to help me verify the incident by sharing my own record. I didn&rsquo;t want to post any public commentary about this incident until I had a reasonable degree of confidence it was legit, not given how much impact it could have in my very own backyard.</p>

		<p>Make sure you secure your Raspberry Pi doing these things.</p>
<p>Just like a PC, a Raspberry Pi can also be vulnerable to attacks if it‚Äôs not properly secured. Whether using it for personal projects or in a professional setup, as long as you connect it to the internet, it‚Äôs vulnerable to attacks. Attackers can exploit a Raspberry Pi, gain unauthorized access, and even compromise the devices connected to the same network. It can also be hijacked and used for malicious activities like botnet operations or for launching denial of service attacks. To stay safe, here are various measures you can take to ensure your Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s safety.</p>

		<p>Web apps may be handy, but see why they come with some drawbacks.</p>
<p>Web apps are a convenient way to access software without needing to download it as individual programs on your PC. However, while I prefer using web apps over Windows apps, they do come with certain limitations that you should keep in mind. These include the lack of certain features and reduced performance, among other drawbacks.</p>

		<p>As businesses adapt within an increasingly digital world, the need for agility, scalability and resilience has never been more critical with innovations, such as multicloud computing rapidly emerging as crucial engines to meet these demands. However, while businesses across the globe leverage the vast benefits of these applications, they face an equally rapid rise in the complexity of securing their assets, delivering unprecedented challenges in detecting and tackling threats to their cybersecurity posture.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a mystique around ribbon microphones due to their being expensive studio-grade items, which has led more than one experimenter down the rabbit hole of making one. [Catherine van West] has posted her experiments in the field, and it makes for an interesting read.</p>
<p>The recipe for a ribbon microphone is very simple indeed ‚Äî suspend a corrugated ribbon of foil in a magnetic field, and take the voltage across the ribbon. But that simplicity hides some significant issues, as the foil is much thinner than the stuff you might roast your turkey under. Such lightweight foil is extremely fragile, and the signwriters leaf used here proved to be difficult to get right.</p>
