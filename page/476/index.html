	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The stakes of compliance and risk management have reached unprecedented heights. Organizations are not just dealing with regulations; they are fighting to protect their reputation, assets, and, most importantly, their people. Among the most effective yet often overlooked methods to ensure preparedness against these threats are tabletop tests.</p>

<p>Tabletop tests serve as a simulation platform where teams can walk through potential incidents in a structured format, offering a deep dive into the intricacies of business continuity plans (BCPs), disaster recovery plans (DRPs), and incident response plans (IRPs). With regulatory requirements from authorities like FFIEC, FDIC, and NCUA, alongside industry standards such as SOC2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR, regular tabletop exercises are not just beneficial—they’re essential to maintaining compliance and ensuring operational resilience.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Anthropic recently unveiled the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants and models to reliable data and tools. However, packaging and distributing MCP servers is very challenging due to complex environment setups across multiple architectures and operating systems. Docker is the perfect solution for this — it allows developers to encapsulate their development environment into containers, ensuring consistency across all team members’ machines and deployments consistent and predictable. In this blog post, we provide a few examples of using Docker to containerize Model Context Protocol (MCP) to simplify building AI applications. </p>

<p>Earth is an easy box though you will likely find it more challenging than &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; in this series and on the harder side of easy, depending on your experience. There are two flags on the box: a user and root flag which include an md5 hash. This has been tested on VirtualBox so may not work correctly on VMware.

	<div>
		<p>Phishing remains one of the most dangerous and persistent cyber threats for individuals and organizations. Modern attacks use a growing arsenal of deceptive techniques that bypass traditional secure email gateways (SEGs) and email authentication measures, targeting organizations, employees, and vendors. From business email compromise (BEC) to QR phishing and account takeovers, these threats are designed to exploit weaknesses across multiple communication channels, including email, Slack, Teams, SMS, and cloud drives.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The Time Zone Database Package (<code>tzdata</code>) provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with the time zone information needed for all applications or runtimes in the operating system to print local time correctly. The GNU C Library (glibc) uses the <code>tzdata</code> package, so APIs like <code>strftime()</code> work correctly, while applications such as <code>/usr/bin/date</code> use this information to print the local date.</p>
<p>The <code>tzdata</code> package contains the data files describing current and historic transitions for various time zones worldwide. This data represents changes required by local governments, time zone boundary changes, UTC offsets, and daylight saving time (DST).</p>

		<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, incident response, and business continuity planning, preparedness is key. In today’s environment, where breaches and disruptions are inevitable, organizations cannot afford to operate with untested protocols or vague plans. This is where <strong>tabletop exercises</strong> come in—providing a structured, scenario-based approach to testing and refining an organization’s readiness for real-world crises.</p>

<p>Tabletop exercises are facilitated discussions that simulate various incident scenarios—such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, or compliance failures. These exercises aren’t just theoretical; they are practical, interactive, and designed to uncover critical weaknesses in processes and decision-making.</p>

		<p>On December 18, the Cyber Threat Alert Level was evaluated and is remaining at Blue (Guarded) due to a vulnerability affecting multiple Cleo products. On December 12, the MS-ISAC released an advisory for a vulnerability in Cleo products that could allow for remote code execution. Organizations and users are advised to update and apply all appropriate vendor security patches to vulnerable systems and to continue to update their antivirus signatures daily. Another line of defense includes user awareness training regarding the threats posed by attachments and hypertext links contained in emails especially from un-trusted sources.</p>
