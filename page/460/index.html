		<p>Dumping traffic on a network interface is one of the most performed steps while debugging networking and connectivity issues. On Linux, tcpdump is probably the most common way to do this, but some use Wireshark too.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-tcpdump-get-the-packets-from">Where does tcpdump get the packets from?</h2>
<p>Internally, both <code>tcpdump</code> and <code>Wireshark</code> use the Packet Capture (<code>pcap</code>) library. When capturing packets, a socket with the <code>PF_PACKET</code> domain is created (see <code>man packet</code>) which allows you to receive and send packets at the layer 2 from the OSI model.</p>

<p>Every engineer is going to have a bad day, but only an unlucky few will have a day so bad that it registers on a seismometer.</p>
<p>We’ve always had a morbid fascination with engineering mega-failures, few of which escape our attention. But we’d never heard of the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector implosion until stumbling upon [Alexander the OK]’s video of the 2001 event. The first half of the video below describes neutrinos in some detail and the engineering problems related to detecting and studying a particle so elusive that it can pass through the entire planet without hitting anything. The Super-Kamiokande detector was built to solve that problem, courtesy of an enormous tank of ultrapure water buried 1,000 meters inside a mountain in Japan and lined with over 10,000 supersized photomultiplier tubes to detect the faint pulses of Chernkov radiation emitted on the rare occasion that a neutrino interacts with a water molecule.</p>

<p>Today I encounterd an Error when creating an ODBC Connection. It stated the “SQL State Error: 28000”.</p>
<p>The Microsoft documentation provides a comprehensive list and explanation of SQL Server error codes from 28000 to 30999. This range includes errors related to authentication issues, permissions, and configuration problems, which are common when setting up or managing SQL Server databases. There you can find the SQL Code to search for all possible Error Codes, the description and if the error exists in the logs.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In today&rsquo;s fast-changing tech world, software companies are always looking for new ways to improve their offerings. One promising technology on the rise is generative artificial intelligence (AI). This blog discusses how GenAI can give a competitive advantage and how business leaders can incorporate it.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-generative-ai">Understanding Generative AI:</h2>
<p>Generative AI is a significant advancement in artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional AI systems that follow set rules and datasets, generative AI models use neural networks to learn from data and create new content. These models not only understand and carry out commands but also produce content that imitates human-like behavior. The most powerful generative AI algorithms are based on neural networks trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data to identify patterns for various tasks.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Small businesses and boutique organizations should use caution when leaning on browser-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) tools to generate ideas, content, and marketing copy, as a set of Google Chrome extensions were recently compromised to deliver info-stealing malware disguised as legitimate updates.</p>
<p>Analyzed by researchers at Extension Total, the cybercriminal campaign has managed to take over the accounts of at least 36 Google Chrome extensions that provide AI and VPN services. The compromised extensions include “Bard AI Chat,” “ChatGPT for Google Meet,” “ChatGPT App,” “ChatGPT Quick Access,” “VPNCity,” “Internxt VPN,” and more, which are used by an estimated total of 2.6 million people.</p>

	<b><time>10.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><em>This article was researched and written by Stefan Dasic, manager, research and response for ThreatDown, powered by Malwarebytes</em></p>
<p>Malwarebytes recently uncovered a widespread cyberattack—referred to here as the “zqxq” campaign as it closely mirrors NDSW/NDSX-style malware behavior—that compromised GroupGreeting[.]com, a popular platform used by major enterprises to send digital greeting cards.  </p>
<p>Upon learning of the attack, GroupGreeting quickly responded and resolved the threat.</p>
<p>This attack is part of a broader malicious campaign that takes advantage of trusted websites with high traffic, especially those that could experience a spike in visitors during busy seasons like the winter holidays. That includes greeting card websites, like GroupGreeting[.]com, that allow users to send group e-cards for birthdays, retirements, weddings, and, of course, holidays like Christmas and New Year’s.  </p>
