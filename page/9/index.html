		<p>Following up my previous blog post, I decided to create a curated list of iOS Forensics References, organized by folder with specific references (links to blog post, research paper, articles, and so on) for each interesting file. </p>
<p>The list is available as a GitHub repository to make it easier to keep it updated. If you have any proposal for addition in terms of file/folders or a specific reference, please let me know and I&rsquo;ll be happy to add it to the list.</p>

		<p>Hello world, it’s been a while since my last series of blog posts! But now I am ready to share with you the results of my recent research.</p>
<p>I face many different challenges in my daily work as a digital forensics analyst, who deals mainly with mobile devices. <strong>All modern smartphones are encrypted</strong> (usually with file-based encryption (FBE)), so obtaining or cracking the passcode is required to gain access to all the data stored on the device. And even if we know the passcode (or the user has not set the passcode, which is increasingly rare these days), we still need an exploit to gain “root” access to the device to read and copy all the data and get our “best acquisition”, usually a full file system (FFS).</p>

<p>Check Point researchers have uncovered a sophisticated credential harvesting attack that leverages Firebase, a popular web application hosting service. This attack involves the creation of highly convincing and professionally designed phishing web pages that impersonate well-known services. The attackers also utilize a compromised vendor to send phishing links within existing email correspondences, making the scam even more deceptive. How it Works: The attackers leverage Firebase to host phishing web pages that mimic legitimate services. By compromising a vendor’s email account, cyber criminals then insert phishing links into ongoing email threads. This tactic increases the likelihood of the recipient trusting the […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>The emergence of containerization has brought about a significant transformation in software development and deployment by providing a consistent and scalable environment on many platforms. For developers trying to optimize their operations, Docker in particular has emerged as the preferred technology.  By using containers as the foundation, developers gain the same key benefits — portability, scalability, efficiency, and security — that they rely on for other workloads, seamlessly extending them to ML and AI applications. Using a real-world example involving a Snake AI game, we’ll examine in this article how TensorFlow.js can be used with Docker to run AI/ML in a web browser.</p>

<p>Every attack leaves a trail, but in containerized environments, this trail can evaporate before you even realize you have been attacked. These environments bring new challenges for security teams, including an expanding attack surface. Containers, while incredibly powerful, are short-lived, and attackers exploit this by moving quickly and covering their tracks. They often download and execute malware, then silently modify, or delete the files to erase evidence of their actions, making it nearly impossible to trace the original attack. Security teams are often left scrambling to piece together what happened.</p>
