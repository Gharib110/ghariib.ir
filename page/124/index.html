<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Much of the current discourse around cyber threat actors&rsquo; misuse of AI is confined to theoretical research. While these studies demonstrate the potential for malicious exploitation of AI, they don&rsquo;t necessarily reflect the reality of how AI is currently being used by threat actors in the wild. To bridge this gap, we are sharing a comprehensive analysis of how threat actors interacted with Google&rsquo;s AI-powered assistant, Gemini. Our analysis was grounded by the expertise of Google&rsquo;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), which combines decades of experience tracking threat actors on the front lines and protecting Google, our users, and our customers from government-backed attackers, targeted 0-day exploits, coordinated information operations (IO), and serious cyber crime networks.</p>

<p>AI is advancing at lightning speed, but it’s also raising some big questions, especially when it comes to security. The latest AI making headlines is DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that’s shaking up the game with its cost-efficient, high-performing models. But it’s also raising red flags for cybersecurity pros.</p>
<p>DeepSeek overnight became a top contender, mostly driven by curiosity. It’s being praised for its efficiency, with models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 performing at a fraction of the cost and energy usage compared to competitors, being trained on Nvidia&rsquo;s lower-power H800 chips.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Privacy Model for Classical &amp; Learned Bloom Filters</strong><br>
<em>Hayder Tirmazi</em></p>
<p>The Classical Bloom Filter (CBF) is a class of Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) for handling Approximate Query Membership (AMQ). The Learned Bloom Filter (LBF) is a recently proposed class of PDS that combines the Classical Bloom Filter with a Learning Model while preserving the Bloom Filter&rsquo;s one-sided error guarantees. Bloom Filters have been used in settings where inputs are sensitive and need to be private in the presence of an adversary with access to the Bloom Filter through an API or in the presence of an adversary who has access to the internal state of the Bloom Filter. Prior work has investigated the privacy of the Classical Bloom Filter providing attacks and defenses under various privacy definitions. In this work, we formulate a stronger differential privacy-based model for the Bloom Filter. We propose constructions of the Classical and Learned Bloom Filter that satisfy $(epsilon, 0)$-differential privacy. This is also the first work that analyses and addresses the privacy of the Learned Bloom Filter under any rigorous model, which is an open problem.</p>
