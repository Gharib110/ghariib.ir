		<p>Maintaining compliance with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards is a complex process that can put significant strain on security and compliance teams. Easing this strain and ensuring compliance relies on effective preparation. As the old adage goes, fail to prepare, prepare to fail. The NERC CIP preparation process is best managed using an automated solution like Fortra’s Tripwire Enterprise or Tripwire State Analyzer. These solutions continuously enforce built-in policies while providing detailed documentation and&hellip;</p>

<p>The age of agile software development and the cloud has caused an explosion in enterprise secrets. From passwords, encryption keys and APIs, to tokens and certificates, digital secrets are what control access when data is transferred between applications. They’re essential to maintaining the security of that data, and in turn, the successful operation of digital enterprises.</p>
<h2 id="a-top-emerging-security-challenge"><strong>A top emerging security challenge</strong></h2>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that secrets are extremely valuable to threat actors. Businesses need a robust secrets management strategy in place in order to not only effectively manage the respective secrets across their lifecycle, but also protect them from compromise. This is becoming a significant challenge within DevOps specifically, with Thales’ Data Threat Report finding that secrets management was identified as the top emerging DevOps security challenge by respondents.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As manufacturers embrace Industry 4.0, many find that implementing new technologies isn’t enough to achieve the promised benefits of increased efficiency, flexibility, and innovation. Enter Industrial DevOps—a set of principles that can help bridge the gap between your Industry 4.0 technologies and the organizational practices needed to fully leverage them. Here’s what you need to know to integrate Industrial DevOps into your Industry 4.0 strategy:</p>
<h2 id="aligning-industrial-devops-with-industry-40">Aligning Industrial DevOps with Industry 4.0</h2>
<p>Industrial DevOps complements Industry 4.0 by providing a framework for organizing, planning, and executing in a digital manufacturing environment. While Industry 4.0 focuses on technologies like IoT, AI, and digital twins, Industrial DevOps addresses the human and process elements needed to transform those technologies.</p>

		<p>I know. You’re thinking I’m talking about Napster, right? Nope. Napster was launched in 1999. Bobby Diggs and the Wu-Tang Clan introduced unbundling into the music industry 6 years earlier in 1993. While the wild musical styles, grimy beats, no hooks, and raw lyrics might be what hip-hop fans laud when talking about the impact of the Wu-Tang Clan, the savvy business person’s perspective is one of awe when it comes to how The RZA (Bobby Diggs’ stage name, pronounced <em>rizza</em>) upended traditional music industry models when he insisted upon each individual artist within the Wu-Tang clan retaining the option to sign as independent artists at any other label.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Open-source software (OSS) has become an indispensable component in many industrial environments. Just last year, 95% of companies said they increased or maintained their use of OSS. According to the Linux Foundation, 70-80% of all code in any modern solution has been directly plucked from OSS solutions,. Cost-efficiency, flexibility, and expansive development community make OSS an attractive option for many organizations looking to innovate while managing budgets. It&rsquo;s also a boon for anyone looking for transparency over pure performance. However, these apparent strengths can mask significant&hellip;</p>

<p>In response to the scale and complexity of modern cloud-native technology, organizations are increasingly reliant on automation to properly manage their infrastructure and workflows. DevOps automation eliminates extraneous manual processes, enabling DevOps teams to develop, test, deliver, deploy, and execute other key processes at scale. Automation thus contributes to accelerated productivity and innovation across the organization.</p>
<p>Automation can be particularly powerful when applied to DevOps workflows. According to the Dynatrace 2023 DevOps Automation Pulse report, an average of 56% of end-to-end DevOps processes are automated across organizations of all kinds.</p>
