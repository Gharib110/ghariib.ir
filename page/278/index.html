		<p>Back in May 2019, along with my colleagues Heather Mahalik and Adrian Leong, we wrote the paper &ldquo;<strong>Using Apple “Bug Reporting” for forensic purposes</strong>&rdquo; and some scripts to parse data stored in Sysdiagnose logs.</p>
<p>The paper is still available for download and, for the most part, is still accurate. But time goes on, and new iOS versions have come on the market in recent years. I took a first look at a sysdiagnose generated on a freshly wiped iPhone with iOS 16 natively installed.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-tailwind-css">What is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
<p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to simplify the process of building custom user interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS libraries that offer predefined components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that enable developers to create unique designs directly in their markup. This flexibility allows for rapid prototyping and the ability to maintain consistency across projects without sacrificing creativity.</p>

		<p>Add your own personalization to Windows with these free customization tools.</p>
<p>Is your computer just a tool, or is it an expression of yourself? Just like how people once went to extreme lengths to decorate their journals and diaries, you can do the same with your desktop. Programs like Rainmeter have long offered deeper customization options than you might get by default, but Rainmeter doesn&rsquo;t get the love it once did, and it&rsquo;s down to sporadic, few-and-far-between updates.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever gazed at the shoreline of Santos, Brazil, and felt like something was tugging at your inner eye level, you’re not alone. In fact, you’ve spotted one of the world’s most bizarre architectural phenomena.</p>
<p>Santos is an interesting contradiction—it’s a sunny coastal city with pristine beaches that also plays host to a bustling port. What draws the eye, however, is the skyline—it’s decidedly askew. This isn’t a Photoshop job or some avant-garde urban planning experiment, either. It’s a consequence of engineering hubris, poor planning, and geology just doing its thing.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>The Meta-Complexity of Secret Sharing</strong><br>
<em>Benny Applebaum, Oded Nir</em></p>
<p>A secret-sharing scheme allows the distribution of a secret $s$ among $n$ parties, such that only certain predefined “authorized” sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, while all other “unauthorized” sets learn nothing about $s$. The collection of authorized/unauthorized sets is defined by a monotone function $f: {0,1}^n rightarrow {0,1}$. It is known that any monotone function can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme; thus, the smallest achievable emph{total share size}, $S(f)$, serves as a natural complexity measure. In this paper, we initiate the study of the following meta-complexity question: Given a monotone function $f$, is it possible to efficiently distinguish between cases where the secret-sharing complexity of $f$ is small versus large? We examine this question across several computational models, yielding the following main results.</p>

		<p><em>This week on the Lock and Code podcast…</em></p>
<p>The era of artificial intelligence everything is here, and with it, come everyday surprises into exactly where the next AI tools might pop up.</p>
<p>There are major corporations pushing customer support functions onto AI chatbots, Big Tech platforms offering AI image generation for social media posts, and even Google has defaulted to include AI-powered overviews into everyday searches.</p>
<p>The next gold rush, it seems, is in AI, and for a group of technical and legal researchers at New York University and Cornell University, that could be a major problem.</p>

		<p>Businesses rely heavily on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for seamless communication and data exchange, the stakes have never been higher. API breaches can lead to significant vulnerabilities, affecting not only the targeted organization but also their customers and partners. Understanding the causes and consequences of these breaches is essential for any business operating in a connected world.</p>

</p>
<p>High-profile incidents, such as the T-Mobile and Dropbox API breaches, have demonstrated the ripple effect these security lapses can have across various industries, from financial services to healthcare and e-commerce. The repercussions can be devastating, ranging from substantial financial losses to lasting damage to an organization’s reputation. As companies navigate this complex landscape, they must recognize that an API breach is much more than just a technical issue—it can alter the course of a business’s future.</p>
