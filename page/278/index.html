A new alpha update to System76â€™s COSMIC desktop environment has arrived with a clutch of interactive improvements. This is the fifth alpha of the Rust-based DE since August 2024. More alphas will arrive each month until all the features planned to ship in the first stable release â€“ or â€˜epochâ€™, as System76 is calling them â€“ are in place, at which point beta testing will begin. Arriving alongside this alpha is a refreshed ISO of Pop!_OS 24.04 (Alpha) with COSMIC Alpha 5 preinstalled â€” but, just like previous COSMIC desktop alpha releases, users of other Linux distributions, like Arch Linux, [â€¦]</p>

		<p>A must-have for the monitor aficionado.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it hard to use a PC unless it has two monitors. It&rsquo;s just nice to have something on the side while I&rsquo;m working away on the main monitor. Some people have a need for five monitors, and I can&rsquo;t even wrap my head around how I&rsquo;d even begin to use that number of screens, but I respect (and fear) the people who do. If you&rsquo;re one who enjoys multiple monitors, you&rsquo;ll like this new Plugable dock announced at CES 2025 that can handle your love for a huge array of screens.</p>

		<p>There are thousands of apps on the list, and you probably have at least some of them installed.</p>
<p>We all know that apps collect our data, but what do companies do with that data? Some sell it, some use it for targeted advertising, some use it to help you connect with other users nearby, and there are countless other ways it can be used too. In a nightmare scenario, a firm that collects that data from thousands of apps has been hacked, with the hackers threatening to release all of the data publicly. This data includes customer lists, information about the industry, and historical location information collected from smartphones.</p>

<p>It is old news that you can print PCB artwork on glossy paper and use a clothes iron to transfer the toner to a copper board, which will resist etchant. But [Squalius] shows us how to do a similar trick with 3D prints in a recent video, which you can see below.</p>
<p>The example used is a QR code, although you can use anything you can print in a mirror image. Of course, heat from a clothes iron isnâ€™t going to be compatible with your 3D-printed plastic. The trick is to use some acrylic medium on the part, place the print face down, and apply more medium to the back of the paper.</p>

	<b><time>10.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Every time you check the weather on your phone, send a message on WhatsApp or pay through PayPal, you interact with APIs. But what exactly are these invisible bridges that power our digital world? Let&rsquo;s dive into the fascinating world of APIs and understand why they&rsquo;re crucial in modern software development.<br>
Before we dive into the tutorial, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at what you should expect:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>Why Do We Need APIs?</li>
<li>Types of APIs</li>
<li>What are the common API architectural styles?</li>
<li>How do APIs work?</li>
<li>Real-world API examples and use cases</li>
<li>What are the benefits of APIs?</li>
<li>What Next?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-an-api-">What is an API? ðŸ¤”</h2>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re at a restaurant. You don&rsquo;t walk into the kitchen to cook your meal - instead, you interact with a waiter who takes your order to the kitchen and brings back your food. An API works similarly â€“ it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;waiter&rdquo; that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.</p>

		<p><em>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Retroâ€™ing and Debugging 2024.</em></p>
<p>A ruptured tendon in my dominant hand just before Christmas 2023 didn&rsquo;t just derail my coding - it catalyzed an unexpected transformation in my career. Within weeks, I found myself thrust from being &lsquo;just another dev&rsquo; into leading a team of six junior developers, compressing what should have been a gradual transition into a sudden leap.</p>

	<b><time>10.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In technical writing, the choice between active and passive voice plays a crucial role in clarity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The active voice is often preferred for its directness and clarity, making it ideal for instructions and explanations where the focus is on who is performing the action.</p>
<p>In contrast, the passive voice is useful when the action itself or its outcome is more important than the performer, often appearing in scientific or procedural contexts.</p>
