<p>The quest for scene understanding in computer vision has led to many segmentation tasks. Panoptic segmentation is a new approach that combines semantic and instance segmentation into one framework.</p>
<p>This technique identifies each pixel captured within an image while distinguishing distinct instances belonging to the same object classes. This article will dive into the details of panoptic segmentation, applications, and challenges.</p>

<p>The transformer-based diffusion models are improving day by day and have proven to revolutionize the text-to-image generation model. The capabilities of transformers enhance the scalability and performance of any model, thereby increasing the model’s complexity.</p>
<p>“<strong>With great power comes great responsibility</strong>”</p>
<p>In this case, <strong>with great model complexities comes great power and memory consumption</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, running inference with models like Stable Diffusion 3 requires a huge <a href="/community/tutorials/gpu-memory-bandwidth">GPU memory</a>, due to the involvement of components—text encoders, diffusion backbones, and image decoders. This high memory requirement causes set back for those using consumer-grade GPUs, which hampers both accessibility and experimentation.</p>

<p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), we are thinking and approaching things differently for many tasks, from natural language processing and text generation to programming. From OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4 to Anthropic Claude, Google’s PaLM, and Apple’s Certainly, we are in a post-LLM era.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting tools is an open-source LLM for program synthesis that’s democratized everyone’s access to coding. It’s called CODEGEN. CODEGEN has been created by the Salesforce Research team. in this article, we will explore its capabilities and implications for the future of programming.</p>

<p>It’s been more than a year since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/small-business-compliance-guides/cybersecurity-risk-management-strategy-governance-incident-disclosure">adopted new rules</a> to enhance the annual reporting of cybersecurity measures practiced by SEC registrants. These requirements are in addition to those about the timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents that these companies experience. This tougher stance from the SEC has prompted executives and boards of directors to look at cybersecurity, not as an afterthought, but as a business-critical priority. The SEC’s new rules also hold these leaders and their companies legally accountable should they not follow the agency&rsquo;s cybersecurity rules — putting chief information security officers in the hot seat. </p>
