		<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Telco cloud</strong> has evolved from the much hyped (but commercially failed) <strong>NFV/Virtual Network Functions or VNFs</strong> and classical <strong>SDN architectures,</strong> to today’s more robust platforms for <strong>managing virtualized and cloud-native network functions</strong> that are tailored to the needs of telecom network workloads. This shift is bringing many new participants to the rapidly evolving <strong>telco cloud</strong> [<strong>1.]</strong> landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1.</strong>  In this instance, “<strong>telco cloud</strong>” means running telco network functions, including <strong>5G SA Core network</strong> on a public, private, or hybrid cloud platform. It does <strong>NOT</strong> imply that telcos are going to be cloud service providers (CSPs) and compete with Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM, Alibaba and other established CSPs.  Telcos gave up on that years ago and sold most of their own data centers which they intended to make cloud resident.</p>

		<p>On Christmas Eve, 2023, the Ohio State Lottery had to shut down some of its systems because of a cyberattack. Around the same time, the Dark Web had a “Leaksmas” event, where cyber criminals shared stolen information for free as a holiday gift. In fact, the month of December 2023 saw more than 2 billion records breached and 1,351 disclosed security incidents, according to research from IT Governance — an increase of 332% and 187%, respectively, over the month of November.</p>

<p>Hey devs! We have some exciting news for ya.</p>
<p>So, backstory first: in case you missed it, OpenAI launched its o1-preview and o1-mini models back in September, optimized for advanced tasks like coding, science, and math.

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Pallet liquidation scams target people looking to purchase pallets of supposedly discounted merchandise, often from major retailers like Amazon.</p>
<p>Groups that engage in pallet liquidation sales are rampant on social media and it’s hard to discern the scammers from the legitimate ones (to be honest, I’ve always thought they were all scams, until someone told me there are legitimate ones), let alone the grey area in between.</p>
<p>The scams are based on the fact that many products are returned and can not be sold again for various reasons. But companies also offer overstock and out-of-season apparel for sale. Most of these companies have the first buyers sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) so when you scroll through different legitimate liquidation websites and marketplaces the origin of the pallet is almost never stated.</p>

<p>While modern gaming systems deliver ever more realistic experiences, there’s still something to be said for the consoles and handhelds of the 80s and 90s. For many, the appeal is nostalgic. Others are attracted to the “lo-fi” graphical and sound design of these games, necessitated by the limited hardware of the time.</p>
<p>That said nobody would claim those old systems were perfect. Which is why a hybrid approach like [Peter Khouly] has been working on with the Pico Pal might be the ultimate solution. This replacement motherboard for the Game Boy Color (GBC) is powered by the RP2350, meaning the external hardware will have the same look and feel as it did back in 1998, but you’ll still be able to reap the benefits of modern emulation.</p>
