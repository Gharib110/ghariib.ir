	<div>
		<p>Following shortly after the .io domain cock-up that left thousands vulnerable to domain hijacking, this week more than 750 domains were jacked via registrar Gandi. Seems like some pretty sloppy administration going on, but that’s how business goes sadly security is still a very much reactive trade. People don’t enable strict controls and audit unless […]</p>

		<p>There’s been a lot of news and scrambling lately related to the Apple SSL vulnerability, and this week Apple announced it would no longer be supporting OS X 10.6 AKA Snow Leopard.

		<p>So Apple pushed out it’s latest and great OS X version 10.10 called Yosemite, but it’s facing a bit of an uproar at the moment about some Spotlight privacy issues.

		<p>Law enforcement agencies have identified Russian national Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov as a key member of the notorious Evil Corp cybercrime group and a LockBit ransomware affiliate.</p>
<p>Ryzhenkov, also known by his alias “Beverley,” has been linked to over 60 LockBit ransomware builds and is believed to have sought to extort at least $100 million from victims in ransom demands.</p>
<p>According to Authorities, Ryzhenkov was unmasked through data obtained during Operation Cronos, a joint investigation with international partners.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This article will show you how to automatically issue certificates using Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (IdM) and cert-manager operator for OpenShift.</p>
<p>Securing communications is a must, not only to protect the data but to provide greater data integrity as well. Applications achieve greater communications security using cryptographic certificates, but these certificates have their own lifecycle. They need to be renewed when expired and the renewal process, when done manually, is prone to errors.</p>

		<p>IntroductionIn a previous article, I demonstrated how to configure the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) feature included in the Identity Management (IdM) Dogtag Certificate Authority (CA). Specifically, I covered installation of IdM with random serial numbers, and how to enable the ACME service and expired certificate pruning. This article explains the management of ACME (currently a technology preview) with IdM and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.Currently, mod_md is the only ACME client implementation completely supported and provided by Red Hat. For this article,</p>
