<p>During a security audit of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Element Android</a>, the official <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> client for Android, we have identified two vulnerabilities in how specially forged intents generated from other apps are handled by the application. As an impact, a malicious application would be able to significatively break the security of the application, with possible impacts ranging from exfiltrating sensitive files via arbitrary chats to fully taking over victimsâ€™ accounts. After private disclosure of the details, the vulnerabilities have been promptly accepted and fixed by the Element Android team.</p>
