		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console.</li>
<li>FortiOS is the Fortinet’s proprietary Operation System which is utilized across multiple product lines.</li>
<li>FortiProxy is a secure web gateway that attempts to protects users against internet-borne attacks, and provides protection and visibility to the network against unauthorized access and threats.</li>
<li>FortiAnalyzer is a log management, analytics, and reporting platform that provides organizations with a single console to manage, automate, orchestrate, and respond, enabling simplified security operations, proactive identification and remediation of risks, and complete visibility of the entire attack landscape.</li>
<li>FortiSandbox 5.0 is a security solution that utilizes a combination of AI/ML, static, and dynamic analysis, inline blocking, and scalable virtual environments to identify, analyze, contextualize, prioritize, and protect against advanced threats in real-time.</li>
<li>FortiAnalyzer Big Data delivers big data network analytics for large and complex networks.</li>
<li>FortiSwitch Manager enables network administrators to cut through the complexities of non-FortiGate-managed FortiSwitch deployments.</li>
<li>FortiPAM provides privileged account management, session monitoring and management, and role-based access control to secure access to sensitive assets and mitigate data breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution with no additional execution privileges needed. Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>Cybercriminals are spreading a stealer disguised as a &ldquo;cheat manager&rdquo; via YouTube videos to steal login credentials. Get the lowdown!</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, our experts discovered a new stealer called Arcane, which collects a wide range of data from infected devices. Now cybercriminals have taken it a step further by releasing ArcanaLoader — a downloader that claims to install cheats, cracks, and other “useful” gaming tools, but which actually infects devices with the Arcane stealer. Despite their lack of creativity in naming the loader, their distribution scheme is actually quite original.</p>
