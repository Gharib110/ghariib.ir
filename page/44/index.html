		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution with no additional execution privileges needed. Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>Cybercriminals are spreading a stealer disguised as a &ldquo;cheat manager&rdquo; via YouTube videos to steal login credentials. Get the lowdown!</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, our experts discovered a new stealer called Arcane, which collects a wide range of data from infected devices. Now cybercriminals have taken it a step further by releasing ArcanaLoader — a downloader that claims to install cheats, cracks, and other “useful” gaming tools, but which actually infects devices with the Arcane stealer. Despite their lack of creativity in naming the loader, their distribution scheme is actually quite original.</p>
