		<p>Microsoft observes more than 600 million ransomware, phishing, and identity attacks each day.¹ One major theme from our analysis of these attacks is clear—organizations with integrated tools have better visibility and more holistic defense than those using a broader portfolio of point solutions. Microsoft wanted to test this observation outside of its own telemetry, hiring Foundry to conduct a survey of senior-level IT decision makers with a primary role in security management at organizations with 500 or more employees to see what they’re experiencing.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>After co-opting the tools and infrastructure of another nation-state threat actor to facilitate espionage activities, as detailed in our last blog, Russian nation-state actor Secret Blizzard used those tools and infrastructure to compromise targets in Ukraine. Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed that these campaigns consistently led to the download of Secret Blizzard’s custom malware, with the Tavdig backdoor creating the foothold to install their KazuarV2 backdoor.</p>
<p>Between March and April 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed Secret Blizzard using the Amadey bot malware relating to cybercriminal activity that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1919 to download its backdoors to specifically selected target devices associated with the Ukrainian military. This was at least the second time since 2022 that Secret Blizzard has used a cybercrime campaign to facilitate a foothold for its own malware in Ukraine. Microsoft also assesses that in January 2024, Secret Blizzard used the backdoor of Storm-1837, a Russia-based threat actor that targets Ukrainian military drone pilots, to download the Tavdig and KazuarV2 backdoors on a target device in Ukraine.</p>

		<p>Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users&rsquo; needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflare’s observations and a review of the year’s DNS trends.</p>

		<p>In 2024, Thanksgiving (November 28), Black Friday (November 29), and Cyber Monday (December 2) significantly impacted Internet traffic, similar to trends seen in 2023 and previous years. This year, Thanksgiving in the US drove a 20% drop in daily traffic compared to the previous week, with a notable 33% dip at 15:45 ET. In contrast, Black Friday and Cyber Monday drove traffic spikes. But how global is this trend, and do attacks increase during Cyber Week?</p>

		<p>Modern application development has evolved dramatically. Gone are the days when a couple of developers, a few machines, and some pizza were enough to launch an app. As the industry grew, DevOps revolutionized collaboration, and Docker popularized containerization, simplifying workflows and accelerating delivery. </p>
<p>Later, DevSecOps brought security into the mix. Fast forward to today, and the demand for software has never been greater, with more than 750 million cloud-native apps expected by 2025.</p>
