	<div>
		<p>See why I should have nver gotten a Photoshop subscription.</p>
<p>Photoshop has long been hailed as the gold standard for photo editing and digital design, but my experience with its subscription model has not been ideal. While its advanced toolset is undeniably powerful, the steep cost and complexity left me questioning its value and considering Photoshop alternatives. I&rsquo;ll explore why I regret subscribing to Photoshop, highlighting my challenges and frustrations that make it less appealing to those who want affordability and simplicity.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Ansible may seem a tad overkill for the average user, but it can simplify network management for your home lab</p>
<p>Experimenting with wacky projects is one of the biggest perks of a home lab, though spinning up a VM with the same ol’ OS and configuration settings can get tiresome after a while. Thankfully, certain apps like Ansible can make your life a lot easier by helping you automate the tedious virtual machine provisioning process.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re weighing up whether you should get a NAS or a DAS for your media library, this might help you make up your mind.</p>
<p>Self-hosting your own data can be a rewarding experience, knowing that you control all of it and can upgrade the amount of storage you have as you need to. However, you may be weighing whether you should get a NAS or a DAS, and there are pros and cons when it comes to a DAS specifically.</p>

		<p>Krita hidden features that can boost efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>Krita is a fantastic open-source tool for creative image manipulation. While Krita is one of many alternatives to Photoshop, it stands alone as a go-to creative tool for many digital artists and illustrators, even for digital illustration from tabletstoo. Krita has many obvious tools and features, like layers, brushes, shapes, and selection tools, but it also provides many hidden features you should use to boost your creative workflow further.</p>

	<b><time>15.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re self-hosting any services, you&rsquo;ll want a reverse proxy as another layer of defense.</p>
<p>Once your home network starts getting more complex, like if you were to start self-hosting apps and services, you might want to consider setting up a reverse proxy to shield those services from the internet. This is essentially another server that sits between the device your self-hosted apps are on and the internet, but instead of providing access outward to the internet, it provides access to those apps.</p>

		<p>This has been a tough year for me: my mom passed away in June, and I&rsquo;m still slowly recovering from the hard blow. It&rsquo;s time to start again doing what I love: researching and sharing!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early September and like every year, that moment is approaching when everyone who deals with mobile forensics starts to tremble at the thought of the arrival of a new version of iOS!</p>
<p>First the good news: the basic and traditional techniques for logical acquisition (or Advanced Logical, if you want to call it that) still work on iOS 18!</p>
