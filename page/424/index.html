<p>Houston, we have a problem: implementing DevSecOps isn’t as straightforward as it seems.</p>
<p>DevSecOps has redefined security in modern software development, becoming the benchmark for organizational success. By embedding security into every phase of the development lifecycle, organizations can deploy faster and collaborate more efficiently while ensuring security at every step. Yet, despite its advantages, according to IDC’s 2024 DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security Survey, only 66% of application development teams use DevSecOps methodologies on average. If it were easy to implement, that number would be much closer to 100%. So, what’s holding teams back? Let’s explore the most common challenges—and how to address them. </p>

<p>In November, we experienced one incident that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.</p>
<p><strong>November 19 10:56 UTC (lasting 1 hour and 7 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>On November 19, 2024, between 10:56:00 UTC and 12:03:00 UTC, the notifications service was degraded and stopped sending notifications to all our dotcom customers. On average, notification delivery was delayed by about one hour. This was due to a database host coming out of a regular maintenance process in read-only mode.</p>
