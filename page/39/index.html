		<p>The fourth episode is dedicated to the most analyzed family of applications: communication and social networking apps.</p>
<p>Before I start, I would like to mention that I have made some corrections to the previous blog post, based on feedback by tool developers. Also, most of them have confirmed to me that they are working on improving their parsing capabilities, based on this blog series. I am happy to support them in that direction!</p>

		<p>I am finally back with the third blog post in the series!</p>
<p>Before I introduce this new post, I want to point out some updates to the previous blog post. </p>
<p>I have corrected a couple of errors related to the Belkasoft tool, in particular the device UDID and the device phone number.</p>
<p>Also, after the blog post, Alexis Brignoni released some new iLEAPP parsers that cover most of the “red” boxes and MSAB confirmed to me that they have already fixed all the “red” boxes from the previous blog post. At the end of the series, I will re-process the dataset with the latest version of the various tools, and create a separate table with the updated comparison.</p>

		<p>As explained in the first blog post, I would like to start discussing the acquisition and processing details.</p>
<p>The acquisition was done by Josh Hickman using the Cellebrite Premium tool and the result is a Full File System capture in the traditional file format created by UFED.</p>
<p>If you open the file EXTRACTION _FFS.zip ZIP you will see that UFED organizes the extracted full file system into 5 subfolders;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>filesystem1</strong>: extraction of system partition, without the mount point “/private/var/mobile/” (“user data&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>filesystem2:</strong> extraction of the mount point for user data (“/private/var/mobile”)</li>
<li><strong>metadata1:</strong> metadata for files stored in “filesystem1”</li>
<li><strong>metadata1:</strong> metadata for files stored in “filesystem2”</li>
<li><strong>extra:</strong> iOS Keychain</li>
</ul>

		<p>Following up my previous blog post, I decided to create a curated list of iOS Forensics References, organized by folder with specific references (links to blog post, research paper, articles, and so on) for each interesting file. </p>
<p>The list is available as a GitHub repository to make it easier to keep it updated. If you have any proposal for addition in terms of file/folders or a specific reference, please let me know and I&rsquo;ll be happy to add it to the list.</p>

		<p>Hello world, it’s been a while since my last series of blog posts! But now I am ready to share with you the results of my recent research.</p>
<p>I face many different challenges in my daily work as a digital forensics analyst, who deals mainly with mobile devices. <strong>All modern smartphones are encrypted</strong> (usually with file-based encryption (FBE)), so obtaining or cracking the passcode is required to gain access to all the data stored on the device. And even if we know the passcode (or the user has not set the passcode, which is increasingly rare these days), we still need an exploit to gain “root” access to the device to read and copy all the data and get our “best acquisition”, usually a full file system (FFS).</p>

<p>Check Point researchers have uncovered a sophisticated credential harvesting attack that leverages Firebase, a popular web application hosting service. This attack involves the creation of highly convincing and professionally designed phishing web pages that impersonate well-known services. The attackers also utilize a compromised vendor to send phishing links within existing email correspondences, making the scam even more deceptive. How it Works: The attackers leverage Firebase to host phishing web pages that mimic legitimate services. By compromising a vendor’s email account, cyber criminals then insert phishing links into ongoing email threads. This tactic increases the likelihood of the recipient trusting the […]</p>

		<p>A look into building IssueOps workflows on GitHub to do everything from CI/CD to handling approvals and more.</p>
<p>The post IssueOps: Automate CI/CD (and more!) with GitHub Issues and Actions appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Software development is filled with repetitive tasks—managing issues, handling approvals, triggering CI/CD workflows, and more. But what if you could automate these types of tasks directly within GitHub Issues? That’s the promise of <strong>IssueOps</strong>, a methodology that turns GitHub Issues into a command center for automation.</p>
