	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Today, I’m thrilled to announce that Amazon Redshift, a widely used, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse, is taking a significant step forward in strengthening the default security posture of our customers’ data warehouses. Some default security settings for newly created provisioned clusters, Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroups, and clusters restored from snapshots have changed. These changes include disabling public accessibility, enabling database encryption, and enforcing secure connections.</p>
<p>Amazon Redshift already supports encryption in transit and at rest. Database encryption is crucial because it helps safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access. Furthermore, restricting public access can be advantageous because it limits the threat surface and helps prevent unauthorized access to the database. By confining the Amazon Redshift cluster within the customer’s virtual private cloud (VPC), the cluster is isolated from the public internet, which significantly reduces the possibility of unauthorized parties discovering and accessing the data warehouse.</p>

</p>
<p>Remember the ZEOS Pocket PC? Perhaps you knew it as the Tidalwave PS-1000. Either way, it was a small clamshell computing device that was first released all the way back in 1992, and perhaps most accurately known as a DOS-based palmtop. Over at [Robert’s Retro] on YouTube, one of these fine devices was put through a repair and a modern upgrade program.</p>
<p>[Robert] educates us on the basics of the machine as he sets about the routine repairs so familiar to anyone in the retrocomputing scene. The first order of business is to clean up the damage to the battery compartment, which had suffered corrosion from leaking AA batteries. We get a solid look inside, and a walk-through on how to modify the device to run off USB-C power. It’s as simple as wiring up a small power module PCB and integrating that into the case, but it’s a neat mod done well—and it makes toying with the device much easier in 2025.</p>

		<p>Be careful when buying; you might snag a fake.</p>
<p>After Nvidia released its highly-hyped GeForce RTX 5090 cards, stockists began selling out really quickly. While we hope that at least some of those cards got into the hands of people who will put them to good use, there are some that ended up in the clutches of scalpers. Now, the price of an RTX 5090 has shot up to $9,000 on the second-hand market, and some people are fighting back against the scalpers with fake product listings.</p>

<p>Chalk is fun to draw with, and some people even get really good at using it to make art on the sidewalk. If you don’t like tediously developing such skills, though, you could go another route. [MrDadVs] built a robot to scrawl chalk pictures for him, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>The robot is known as AP for reasons you’ll have to watch the video to understand. You might be imagining a little rover that crawls around on wheels dotting at the pavement with a stick of chalk, but the actual design is quite different. Instead, [MrDadVs] effectively built a polar-coordinate plotter to make chalk pictures on the ground. AP has a arm loaded with a custom liquid chalk delivery system for marking the pavement. It’s rotated by a stepper motor with the aid of a 3D-printed geartrain that helps give it enough torque. It’s controlled by an ESP32 running the FluidNC software which is a flexible open-source CNC firmware. [MrDadVs] does a great job of explaining how everything works together, from converting cartesian coordinates into a polar format, to getting the machine to work wirelessly.</p>

		<p>By Marc Ilunga Key derivation is essential in many cryptographic applications, including key exchange, key management, secure communications, and building robust cryptographic primitives. But it’s also easy to get wrong: although standard tools exist for different key derivation needs, our audits often uncover improper uses of these tools that could compromise key security.
