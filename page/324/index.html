<h2 id="what-is-kubernetes-helm">What Is Kubernetes Helm? </h2>
<p>Kubernetes Helm is a package manager designed to simplify the installation and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. It handles the process of defining, installing, and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications. Kubernetes Helm packages, known as charts, contain all necessary components to run an application, service, or tool on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Charts are collections of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. They enable users to deploy cohesive applications as one unit, managing dependencies and configurations through a single interface. This approach reduces complexity, enhancing reproducibility and scalability in cloud-native environments. </p>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> should be introduced as a subject in high schools, given its growing importance in job postings. This is the opinion of LinkedIn’s community, surveyed by OPIT – Open Institute of Technology, an EU-accredited academic institution led by Professor Francesco Profumo, former Minister of Education, and Riccardo Ocleppo, Founder and Director. <strong>According to the survey, 66% of LinkedIn users think it is essential to teach AI in high schools. Additionally, 72% observed an increase in AI-related mentions in job postings, while 48% stated that AI proficiency is a key requirement for the companies they applied to. AI is primarily used for text generation (38%), research and analysis (38%), and translations (23%).</strong></p>
