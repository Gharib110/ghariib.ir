Industry experts will tell you the best way to evolve your startup ISV into an established ISV is with DevOps — and they’re probably right. DevOps, however, which has only been in the mainstream for a little less than a decade, can be a difficult concept to master, and many software developers—especially startups—are still navigating […]</p>

<p>When people think of open-source software, they often associate it with Linux, known for its vast range of available tools. However, there are several high-quality open-source tools that are developed specifically for Windows. These tools offer advanced, unique features that often don’t have direct equivalents on Linux.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore <strong>five essential open-source tools available exclusively on Windows</strong>, diving into their standout features and why every developer should be familiar with them.</p>

This is the opinion of LinkedIn’s community, surveyed by OPIT – Open Institute of Technology, an EU-accredited academic institution led by Professor Francesco Profumo, former Minister of Education, and Riccardo Ocleppo, Founder and Director. <strong>According to the survey, 66% of LinkedIn users think it is essential to teach AI in high schools. Additionally, 72% observed an increase in AI-related mentions in job postings, while 48% stated that AI proficiency is a key requirement for the companies they applied to. AI is primarily used for text generation (38%), research and analysis (38%), and translations (23%).</strong></p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A New Method for Solving Discrete Logarithm Based on Index Calculus</strong><br>
<em>Jianjun HU</em></p>
<p>Index Calculus (IC) algorithm is the most effective probabilistic algorithm for solving discrete logarithms over finite fields of prime numbers, and it has been widely applied to cryptosystems based on elliptic curves. Since the IC algorithm was proposed in 1920, the research on it has never stopped, especially discretization of prime numbers on the finite fields, both the algorithm itself and its application have been greatly developed. Of course, there has been some research on elliptic curves,but with little success. For the IC algorithm, scholars pay more attention to how to improve the probability of solving and reduce the time complexity of calculation. It is the first time for the IICA to study the optimization problem of the IC by using the method of integer. However, the IICA only studies the case of integer up, and fails to consider the case of integer down. It is found that the integer direction of the IICA can be integer up or integer down, but the concept of modular multiplication needs to be used when integer down. After optimizing the IICA, the probability of successful solution of discrete logarithm is increased by nearly 2 times, and the number of transformations is also reduced to a certain extent, thus reducing the time complexity of solution. The re-optimized the IC algorithm greatly improves the probability of successful the IC solution. This research result poses a serious challenge to cryptosystems based on finite fields of prime numbers.</p>
