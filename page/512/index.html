<p>DevOps and platform engineering are essential disciplines that provide immense value in the realm of cloud-native technology and software delivery. However, these practices cannot stand alone. Rather, they must be bolstered by additional technological investments to ensure reliability, security, and efficiency. One of these key investments includes observability.</p>
<p>Observability of applications and infrastructure serves as a critical foundation for DevOps and platform engineering, offering a comprehensive view into system performance and behavior. It goes beyond traditional monitoring—metrics, logs, and traces—to encompass topology mapping, code-level details, and user experience metrics that provide real-time insights. This real-time awareness enables teams to rapidly detect and resolve issues: both indispensable capabilities for maintaining the agility and reliability that are central to DevOps and platform engineering processes.</p>

<p>Red Hat and Dynatrace are joining forces to revolutionize day-one and day-two operations. A tight integration between Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Dynatrace Davis® AI, and the Dynatrace observability and security platform enables closed-loop remediation to automate the process from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting a problem</li>
<li>Managing incidents in corresponding tools</li>
<li>Identifying the root cause and proper countermeasures</li>
<li>Executing corrective actions</li>
<li>Keeping relevant stakeholders in the loop</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, disruptions are minimized, MTTR is significantly decreased, and DevSecOps and SREs collaborate efficiently to boost productivity.</p>

<p>Urban populations are expected to account for 68% of the global population, putting unprecedented strain on cities’ infrastructure. This rapid urbanisation is exposing critical gaps that compromise residents’ quality of life, from inefficient essential services to grid and water-management deficiencies. The implications are particularly profound for underserved communities, where infrastructure and basic services may already be lacking. Municipal leaders, policymakers, and sustainability directors are now grappling with the challenge of ensuring their cities evolve in a way that is both technologically advanced and equitable and inclusive.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Amazon Macie is a managed service that uses machine learning (ML) and deterministic pattern matching to help discover sensitive data that’s stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. Macie can detect sensitive data in many different formats, including commonly used compression and archive formats. However, Macie doesn’t support the discovery of sensitive data within images, audio, video, or other types of multimedia content. Customers often ask how to effectively detect whether there’s sensitive data in images. This can be a significant challenge for organizations, especially those operating in highly regulated industries with strict data protection requirements.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Kubernetes is an open source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines. It’s become the go-to solution for orchestrating containers in production environments. But if you’re developing or testing locally, setting up a full Kubernetes cluster can be complex. That’s where Docker Desktop comes in — it lets you run Kubernetes directly on your local machine, making it easy to test microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized apps without needing a remote cluster.</p>
