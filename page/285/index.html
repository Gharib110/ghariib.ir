		<p>Don&rsquo;t toss those old USB drives, they can still be pretty useful!</p>
<p>Ever since floppy disks were phased out, zip drives went the way of the dinosaurs, and file sizes increased to the point that CDs weren&rsquo;t big enough to pass them along, the humble USB drive has been the portable storage medium of choice. Chances are you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of them in your desk drawer—ones you bought, ones you were given, and ones that came with hardware with the relevant driver files on them.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, when your devices are infected with a virus, it’s not as easy as a little bed rest for them to recover, and the damage can be long-lasting. A cyberattack can compromise your computers, phones and tablets, and open the door for cyber thieves to steal your sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>According to a study by the University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering, there is a cyberattack approximately every 39 seconds. The most common form of cyberattack is malware, a type of software that’s used to break into your computer system. Last year alone, there were more than 6 billion malware attacks detected worldwide. Some of the many forms of malware include:</p>

		<p>Heutzutage wird das Active Directory (AD) von Angreifern sehr häufig ins Visier genommen, denn es ist eine Art Generalschlüssel, der den Zugang zum gesamten Netzwerk ermöglicht. AD stellt die Verzeichnisdienste bereit, mit denen Administratoren im gesamten Netzwerk Berechtigungen verwalten und Zugriff auf Ressourcen gewähren. Es ist somit für die täglichen Abläufe eines Unternehmens unverzichtbar – und […]</p>

		<p>From the apps on our smartphones to chatbot assistant services, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our lives in both big and small ways. But as exciting as AI can be, it’s also important to understand its potential risks. October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, making it the perfect time to become more cyber-savvy about AI. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>AI is a technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. In everyday life, AI is behind many of the technologies we use. It powers recommendations on streaming TV services like Netflix, improves photo quality on your smartphone, and even aids in driving cars. AI is like having a smart assistant that can process information quickly, automate daily tasks, and make technology more intuitive.</p>

		<p>The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), a prominent national association for amateur radio enthusiasts, recently confirmed that it paid a staggering $1 million ransom to cybercriminals.</p>
<h2 id="arrl-hit-by-cyber-attack">ARRL Hit by Cyber Attack</h2>
<p>ARRL found itself at the mercy of a sophisticated ransomware attack. Upon realizing the severity of the attack, the ARRL was left with limited options. The decision to pay the $1 million ransom was not made lightly, but it was deemed necessary to regain access to critical data and ensure the organization’s continued operation. The move, while effective in recovering data, raises ethical and practical concerns about the long-term implications of complying with ransom demands.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In the final quarter of 2022, the infostealer malware, Rhadamanthys, was found. Given that it could target browser extensions and wallet clients installed on the victim’s computer, its capabilities demonstrated a particular interest in cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>The primary means of distribution for this threat that have been noticed are phishing emails and phony software websites that are advertised through Google Ads, regardless of the vertical or region.</p>
<p>Although its distribution and information theft methods have been observed previously, its downloader component makes it stand out. It analyzes by conventional security methods extremely difficult by combining sophisticated anti-analysis techniques with heavy obfuscation.</p>
