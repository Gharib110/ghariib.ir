		<p><em>This article was researched and written by Stefan Dasic, manager, research and response for ThreatDown, powered by Malwarebytes</em></p>
<p>Malwarebytes recently uncovered a widespread cyberattack—referred to here as the “zqxq” campaign as it closely mirrors NDSW/NDSX-style malware behavior—that compromised GroupGreeting[.]com, a popular platform used by major enterprises to send digital greeting cards.  </p>
<p>Upon learning of the attack, GroupGreeting quickly responded and resolved the threat.</p>
<p>This attack is part of a broader malicious campaign that takes advantage of trusted websites with high traffic, especially those that could experience a spike in visitors during busy seasons like the winter holidays. That includes greeting card websites, like GroupGreeting[.]com, that allow users to send group e-cards for birthdays, retirements, weddings, and, of course, holidays like Christmas and New Year’s.  </p>

<p>Secure elements (SE) on Android and secure enclaves on iOS have emerged as trusted hardware-backed solutions for storing and protecting sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys. They are often touted as <em>tamper-resistant</em>, isolated, and secure environments with the highest certifications (e.g., AVA_VAN.5 under Common Criteria). However, while the hardware is robust, the <strong>software layers above it</strong> introduce significant vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>This blog post highlights the risks of relying solely on SEs or secure enclaves, including potential <strong>hooking attacks</strong>, <strong>emulation</strong>, and the implications of <strong>jailbroken/rooted devices</strong>. We also explore how software-level weaknesses can undermine hardware-backed security. </p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced world of software development and IT operations, organizations need to continuously improve their ability to deploy applications quickly, reliably, and at scale. This is where DevOps practices come into play, blending development and operations for more efficient workflows. One of the cornerstones of a successful DevOps implementation is <strong>monitoring and observability</strong>, as it ensures real-time visibility into application performance, system health, and infrastructure. Datadog, a leading platform in this field, is at the forefront of providing these capabilities, helping DevOps teams ensure better service delivery, faster problem resolution, and enhanced operational insights.</p>

<p>DevOps is a set of practices that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the system development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. Implementing DevOps effectively within an organization can lead to faster delivery, more reliable products, and more efficient collaboration between teams. This article will provide a detailed guide on how DevOps can be implemented within an organization and how different approaches, such as incorporating <strong>DevOps best practices</strong> alongside modern <strong>tools</strong> and methodologies, work together for success.</p>

		<p>At the time of writing, there are hundreds of thousands of publicly known vulnerabilities. These range from critical flaws that could cause irreparable damage if exploited to low-severity issues that might seem barely even worth bothering with. With vulnerability management, the challenge is knowing which is which.  With so many vulnerabilities across operating systems, networks, software, […]</p>
