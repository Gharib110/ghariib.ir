<p>The <a href="/blog/winter-break-of-code">Winter Break of Code</a>, being closely linked by name to the season of Winter, began with a calm trickle of ex{hausted,cited} people carrying laptops and cell phone collections after a parade of delays and weather issues. Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening. It was very welcome.</p>

<p>After our wonderful experience with <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure">Spring Break Of Code</a>, we were excited to try this again. Even with high expectations based on our experience in the Spring, the response was still better than what we could have hoped for. The hundreds of high-quality proposals we received were really inspiring, and we hope that one day we can get a space large enough for all of the amazing people who are passionate about the development of privacy-enhancing technology.</p>

<p>At Open Whisper Systems, we’re working to both advance the state of the art for secure communication and also reduce the friction required for ordinary people to make use of it. We want everyone to have access to advanced secure communication methods that are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a normal text message.</p>

<p>At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been working on improving our encrypted asynchronous chat protocol for TextSecure. The TextSecure protocol was originally a derivative of <a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html">OTR</a>, with minor changes to accommodate it for transports with constraints like SMS or Push. Some of the recent changes we’ve made include <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability">simplifying and improving OTR’s deniability</a>, as well as creating a <a href="/blog/asynchronous-security">key exchange mechanism for asynchronous transports</a>. Our most recent change incorporates what we believe to be substantial improvements to OTR’s forward secrecy “ratchet.”</p>

<p>At Open Whisper Systems, we’re focused on creating easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology. Our projects are free, Open Source, and tend to be oriented around the mobile environment. We’ve been working on apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">TextSecure</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone">RedPhone</a> (which provide secure text messages and secure phone calls) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed secure communication tools that are both privacy-preserving <em>and</em> a joy to use.</p>

<p>My cell phone used to be a black and white Nokia until a couple of weeks ago when I decided to enter in the smartphone world. Now that there are more mobile devices connected to the internet than computers, I think it’s time for me as well to discover the possibilities of this technology. During this few weeks I’ve been playing with my new toy, checking how to secure it, and seeing what free software is around to use cryptography on it.</p>
