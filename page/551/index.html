<p>Using the lessons we’ve learned from the SMS environment over the past four years, we’ve developed an open protocol for asynchronous chat that enables private communication instantly with friends, private groups for real-time collaboration, and the ability to quickly and seamlessly share media privately – all without depending on SMS.</p>

<p>Spring Break of Code 2013 I cut open my foot and hand while surfing; both wounds easily warranted stitches. Winter Break of Code 2014 I banged the top of my foot surfing over some coral; the cuts were sealed within minutes. Spring Break of Code 2013 I struggled with the Android SDK, while Winter Break of Code 2014 I caught myself taking a few too many short-cuts. On day zero nothing is easy, but over time you improve, spilling a little less blood every time.</p>
