<p>We’re currently in the process of transitioning TextSecure to use a device’s data channel as a transport for communication with other TextSecure users whenever possible. This enables communication with the upcoming <a href="/blog/iphone-rsn">TextSecure for iOS</a>, helps users avoid SMS fees, and obscures conversation metadata from telcos.</p>
<p>The transition to a new transport is also a good opportunity for us to evaluate and introduce additional cryptographic protocol changes. Below is one cryptographic protocol change we’re thinking of making that we’d welcome feedback on.</p>

<p>We have *finally* finished packaging the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/passing-the-hash/downloads">Pass the Hash Toolkit</a> in an elegant and intelligent way, thanks to samba4. Samba 4 is architectured differently than previous versions and many parts of the core functionality have been moved into libraries. This made it possible for us to easily override a couple of functions in those libraries with the help of the dynamic loader (using LD_PRELOAD) and saved us the need to recompile a patched samba in order to introduce the PTH tookit to Kali. All PTH tools and utilities have a “<strong>pth-</strong>” prefix.</p>

<p>Our first attempts at building an accessible version of Kali failed and after a bit of digging, we found that there were several upstream <a href="https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/gdm3">GNOME Display Manager</a> (GDM3) bugs in <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, which prevented these accessibility features from functioning with the GDM greeter. Working together with an upstream GNOME developer, we knocked out these bugs and had the fixes implemeted in Kali, and hopefully in future builds of GDM3 in Debian. To make the <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/">Kali installation</a> accessible as well, we have added a new “accessibility” boot option that triggers the speech engine during the installation process.</p>

<p>Because secure systems aren’t valuable if they’re not used, Whisper Systems has always focused on delivering strong cryptography alongside a great user experience. That’s the reason <a href="http://www.whispersystems.org/blog/client-side-audio-quality">call quality</a> has always been a priority in RedPhone’s development.</p>
<p>We know that, for many users, RedPhone has consistently delivered a call quality experience comparable to commercial mobile VoIP solutions. But we also hear from users who report problems like dropped calls, distracting levels of echo and latency, or inaudibly low in-call volume. While we investigate these reports and attempt to resolve them, we don’t have a clear view of what situations cause RedPhone’s call quality to degrade, or how to prioritize our development efforts.</p>

<p>I know very well that each and every crisis of modernity is concentrating, concatenating, and seating more deeply into everyday life. I know the struggles of the world’s unseen and unheard are being subsumed – appropriated – under and into the framework of a liberal democracy, leaving those at the periphery still under the yoke of capital. The Right further entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the <a href="http://www.alecexposed.org/">United States</a>, and (more extremely) abroad (<a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/book_racism_becoming_more_acceptable_in_finland/6360055">Finland</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/greek-politics">Greece</a>, … et al.). The Left is no less problematic: reiterating the petty values of social democracy, negotiating the terms of our entrapment within capitalism. Every season, new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also work in reverse. The world’s genetic library – the most prime commons, if ever one existed – is rapidly contracting via extinction, privatization, and engineering. The colossal failure of ideology in the twentieth century has left the radicals of today no other choice but to see themselves as “post-ideological”. This is a deeply concerning conundrum, as ideology survives in post-ideology, different only to the extent that it is less apparent. Yes, it seems like we are living in end times – an entire era of Apocalypse – made only more insidious by our optimism in its shadow.</p>

<p>The main sound on top of the ocean is the click clack of laptop keys, and the jangle of test calls and SMSes. A neighbor stopped by to comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working instead of surfing made sense in his mind only in the land of money at the end of the tunnel. He loaned us his stand up paddle boards, surely expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited into the sunset. A journalist visiting Open Whisper Systems’ Spring Break of Code commented that she expected more philosophy, politics, and conversation. After all this group is composed of people who are not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists, and humanists. <a href="/blog/streamlining-textsecure-settings/">Lilia</a> went over some of the <em>why</em>, but practically anyone could see we were concentrating on the <em>how</em>, and in the frenzied silence it was clear that a common philosophy was assumed and what bound us here was the challenges in the technology to power that philosophy.</p>
