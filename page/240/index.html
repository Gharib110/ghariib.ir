		<p>If you need to organize your projects, try using Kanban boards.</p>
<p>A Kanban board helps visualize all the tasks in your projects. It helps you see everything clearly, prioritize tasks, and track progress. Each task is represented by a card that moves along a path, usually labeled “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” This way, you can quickly see what’s happening, who’s doing what, and how the project is progressing.</p>

<em>Daehyeon Bae, Sujin Park, Minsig Choi, Young-Giu Jung, Changmin Jeong, Heeseok Kim, Seokhie Hong</em></p>
<p>Electromagnetic side-channel analysis is a powerful method for monitoring processor activity and compromising cryptographic systems in air-gapped environments. As analytical methodologies and target devices evolve, the importance of leakage localization and probe aiming becomes increasingly apparent for capturing only the desired signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Despite its importance, there remains substantial reliance on unreliable heuristic approaches and inefficient exhaustive searches. Furthermore, related studies often fall short in terms of feasibility, practicality, and performance, and are limited to controlled DUTs and low-end MCUs.</p>

<p>The web browser has transformed significantly in recent years, becoming one of the most used tools for work today. However, as organizations adopt hybrid work models and cloud-based operations, securing this work tool has proved a challenge. Security infrastructures haven’t evolved as fast as the browser, making them prone to cyberattacks. With browsers being the primary gateway to the internet, any security lapse can lead to broad opportunities for significant data breaches and operational disruptions. Understanding the risks and implementing robust security measures is crucial for safeguarding the work we do today.</p>

<p>In a groundbreaking development poised to reshape the landscape of quantum computing, D-Wave Systems has announced their latest innovation: the Advantage2 quantum processor. As the industry grapples with an ever-increasing demand for computational power, this announcement signals a pivotal moment in the quest to harness the full potential of quantum technology.</p>
<p><strong>Game-Changing Technology</strong> The Advantage2 processor boasts a staggering 7,000 qubits, significantly surpassing its predecessors and setting a new benchmark for quantum performance. This advancement is expected to enhance quantum annealing processes, thereby accelerating solutions for complex optimization problems that classical computers struggle to handle efficiently.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Quantum-resistant secret handshakes with dynamic joining, leaving, and banishment: GCD revisited</strong><br>
<em>Olivier Blazy, Emmanuel Conchon, Philippe Gaborit, Philippe Krejci, Cristina Onete</em></p>
<p>Secret handshakes, introduced by Balfanz et al. [3], allow users associated with various groups to determine if they share a common affiliation. These protocols ensure crucial properties such as fairness (all participants learn the result simultaneously), affiliation privacy (failed handshakes reveal no affiliation information), and result-hiding (even participants within a shared group cannot infer outcomes of unrelated handshakes). Over time, various secret-handshake schemes have been proposed, with a notable advancement being the modular framework by Tsudik and Xu. Their approach integrates three key components: group signature schemes, centralized secure channels for each group, and decentralized group key-agreement protocols. Building upon this modularity, we propose significant updates. By addressing hidden complexities and revising the security model, we enhance both the efficiency and the privacy guarantees of the protocol. Specifically, we achieve the novel property of Self distinction—the ability to distinguish between two users in a session without revealing their identities—by replacing the group signature primitive with a new construct, the List MAC. This primitive is inherently untraceable, necessitating adjustments to the original syntax to support stronger privacy guarantees. Consequently, we introduce the Traitor Catching paradigm, where the transcript of a handshake reveals only the identity of a traitor, preserving the anonymity of all other participants. To showcase the flexibility and robustness of our updated framework, we present two post-quantum instantiations (a hash-based one and another based on lattices). Our approach not only corrects prior limitations but also establishes a new benchmark for privacy and security in secret handshakes.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 30, 2024</p>
<p>The first event considered to be a ransomware attack happened in 1989, according to CNBC.</p>
<p>A hacker physically mailed floppy disks claiming to contain software that could help determine whether someone was at risk of developing AIDs.</p>
<p>However, when installed, the software would hide directories and encrypt file names on people’s computers after they’d rebooted 90 times.</p>
