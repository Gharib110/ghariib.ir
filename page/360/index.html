		<p>The next generation of Intel mobile processors has finally arrived.</p>
<p>Intel launched numerous new Arrow Lake mobile processors at CES 2025 to round out its portfolio of low-power CPUs. With the 200V series already available, the company focused on new Core Ultra 200HX, 200H, and 200U processors at this year&rsquo;s event. Intel is offering some serious performance with some of these SKUs, including the flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX and its impressive 24 cores.</p>

		<p>In the recent codecov.io security incident, an attacker modified a shell script used by a common software development tool for code coverage. This modification did not take place at the original source code repository where it would have been visible to others, but after the code was packaged and placed on the web server from which it was served.</p>
<p>Prompted by this incident, we are now releasing new tools that provide information and detection of similar attacks against other projects. The scope is limited to attacks that modify the released code and do not touch the original source code. The following tools are now available:</p>

<p>When it comes to productivity software, Microsoft 365 and Google Docs are household names. They dominate the market, offering cloud-based document creation and collaboration with integrated services. But there’s a growing interest in alternatives that don&rsquo;t lock you into proprietary ecosystems. That’s where ONLYOFFICE Docs steps in.</p>

	<b><time>06.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of digital security, the adage &ldquo;patch or perish&rdquo; encapsulates a stark reality. The timely application of software patches is not just a best practice—it is a necessity. The vulnerabilities that lurk in unpatched software can serve as gateways for cybercriminals, leading to severe breaches, operational disruptions, and substantial financial losses.</p>
<p>The imperative to keep software up-to-date has never been more pressing, yet patch management often takes a backseat in organizations. It&rsquo;s not merely a technical oversight; it&rsquo;s a question of diligence and prioritization.</p>

<p>Normally, you have a choice with PCB prototypes: fast or cheap. [Stephen Hawes] has been trying fiber lasers to create PCBs. He’s learned a lot which he shares in the video below. Very good-looking singled-sided boards take just a few minutes. Fiber lasers are not cheap but they are within range for well-off hackers and certainly possible for a well-funded hackerspace.</p>
<p>One thing that’s important is to use FR1 phenolic substrate instead of the more common FR4. FR4 uses epoxy which will probably produce some toxic fumes under the laser.</p>

		<p>Renowned mathematician and quantum computing pioneer Peter W. Shor PhD ’85 has been named the recipient of MIT’s 2022-2023 James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award, the highest honor the Institute faculty can bestow upon one of its members each academic year.</p>
<p>The Killian Award citation credits Shor, who is the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics, with having made “seminal contributions that have forever shaped the foundations of quantum computing. Indeed, quantum computing exists today, in practice, because of Peter Shor.”</p>
