<p>Over the course of the 1990s we saw huge developments in the world of PC graphics cards, going from little more than the original IBM VGA standard through super VGA and then so-called “Windows accelerator” cards which brought the kind of hardware acceleration the console and 16 bit home computer users had been used to for a while. At the end of the decade we had the first generation of 3D accelerator chipsets which are ancestors of today’s GPUs.</p>

<p>Let’s get it straight: it is wrong to have more than one application container inside a single Pod. There are different reasons behind this statement and I will mention just a few of them. In any cases, the way Kubernetes has been designed brings us to the fact that having just one application container per Pod gives us a lot more flexibility.</p>

<p>The advent of agile methodologies has certainly been a phenomenon similar to the revolution of the 1960s. I believe that it’s some sort of Woodstock of information, which, as often happens in life, I only saw from afar.</p>
<p>However, I continue to meet people who were there and who always stop to tell me that such an event will never happen again <strong>and how the programmers of the past loved each other</strong>, exchanged flower crowns, etc. Well, in short, the Robert Downey Jr. meme fits perfectly.</p>

		<p>We’re excited to announce the ability to use Entra profile information in Azure DevOps. This has been a long-standing feature request from the community (ex. profile, picture, email, and name). Beyond the convenience of configuring profile information in one place and ensuring the accuracy of personal information, using Entra profile information in Azure DevOps provides important security and compliance benefits for Enterprise customers.</p>
<p>Today we encourage users in Entra backed organizations to turn on <strong>Entra Profile information</strong> in Preview Features. When you do, your Azure DevOps profile will become read-only, and information will be populated from Entra instead.</p>
