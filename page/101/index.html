<p>Cyber security education is not just a priority—it’s a necessity in today’s digital landscape. With cyber attacks on the rise globally, there is an unprecedented demand for skilled professionals to safeguard critical infrastructures, businesses, and individuals. To address this urgent need, Check Point’s SecureAcademy Program collaborates with over 20 nonprofits and 200 institutions worldwide, delivering cutting-edge cyber security training to underserved and diverse communities. Nonprofits are uniquely vulnerable to cyber attacks due to several factors. Many lack dedicated IT staff with cyber security expertise, making it difficult to identify and address vulnerabilities. Budget constraints often prevent them from investing in […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Red Hat Go Toolset includes modifications to allow applications to optionally use OpenSSL as a cryptographic backend instead of the standard Go crypto implementation. This approach replaces upstream Go’s BoringSSL bindings with bindings into Red Hat’s own distribution of OpenSSL. The Go Toolset runtime is designed to be able to detect whether or not the operating system is booted in FIPS mode and to select either the standard crypto or OpenSSL back end accordingly.</p>

		<p>Analysis of payloads suggest affiliates may be using a shared codebase or common builder to deploy attacks under different RaaS brand names.</p>
<p>The previous six months have seen heightened activity around new and emerging ransomware operations. Across the tail-end of 2024 and into 2025, we have seen the rise of groups such as FunkSec, Nitrogen and Termite. In addition, we have seen the return of Cl0p and a new version of LockBit (<em>aka</em> LockBit 4.0).</p>

I won’t lie: it’s easy to add or remove startup apps, commands, and scripts in Ubuntu. Just open the Startup Applications tool, click ‘Add’, and away you go. But while Ubuntu’s utility is adequate, it’s not as user-friendly as similar tools available elsewhere. Sure, Startup Applications is equipped with the critical customisation fields a user will need to curate a set of software/services to start at login — SSH agent, VPN app, password manager, backup script, resolution tweaks, and so on — but it’s rather rote.
