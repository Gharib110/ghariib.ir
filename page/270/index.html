<p>In the world of showing off, there is alongside ‘Does it play Doom?’ that other classic of ‘Does it play Bad Apple?’. Whereas either would be quaint in the context of the Vim editor, this didn’t deter [Nolen Royalty] from making Vim play the Bad Apple video. As this is a purely black and white video, this means that it’s possible to convert each frame into a collection of pixels, with regular expression based search and custom highlighting allowing each frame to be rendered in the Vim window.</p>

		<p>Theoretical BadRAM attack on virtualization systems exploits a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors.</p>
<p>Researchers from three European universities recently demonstrated the so-called BadRAM attack. This attack is made possible because of a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors, and primarily threatens cloud-solution providers and virtualization systems. In the worst-case scenario, the vulnerability could be used to compromise data from highly secure virtual machines.</p>
<p>However, implementing this scenario in practice would be quite difficult. The attack requires physical access to the server, plus the highest level of access to the software. Before discussing the BadRAM attack in detail, we should first understand the concept of a trusted execution environment (TEE).</p>

	<div>
		<p>BayMark Health Services, Inc. (BayMark) notified an unknown number of patients that attackers stole their personal and health information.</p>
<p>BayMark profiles itself as North America’s largest provider of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for substance use disorders helping tens of thousands of individuals with recovery.</p>
<p>In a breach notification, the company disclosed that on October 11, 2024 it learned about an incident that disrupted the operations of some of its IT systems. This incident consisted of an unauthorized party accessing some of the files on BayMark’s systems between September 24 and October 14 of last year.</p>

		<p>Privacy is a hot topic at the moment - it continues to dominate the headlines as news of new NSA incursions, celebrity phone hacks, and corporate breaches are being reported on an increasingly regular basis. In response to this, a number of products have been brought to market that attempt to provide consumers with a greater level of privacy than typical devices allow for. In the phone market, one of the premier products to be released in recent years is undoubtedly the BlackPhone (<a href="http://www.blackphone.ch">http://www.blackphone.ch</a>), which has been cited numerous times in tech publications as being one of the best available defenses against mass surveillance, as it provides full end-to-end encryption facilities for voice calls and text/MMS messaging.</p>

<p>[Boz] wants to build a retrocomputer, but where to start? You <em>could</em> start with the computery bits, like say the CPU or the bus architecture, but where’s the fun in that? Instead, [Boz] built a righteous blinkenlights array.</p>
<p>What’s cool about this display is that it’s ready to go out of the box. All of the LEDs are reverse-mount and assembled by the board maker. The 19″ 2U PCBs serve as the front plates, so [Boz] was careful not to use any through-hole parts, which also simplified the PCB assembly, of course. Each slice has its own microcontroller and a few shift registers to get the bits lit up, and that’s all there is to it. They take incoming data at 9600 baud and output blinkiness.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In the era of data-driven decision-making, weather data has become an invaluable resource for businesses and individuals. Whether it’s for logistics, agriculture, or travel planning, a real-time weather data collection system can provide actionable insights. In this blog, we’ll walk through building a Weather Data Collection System using Python, the OpenWeather API, and AWS S3 for storage.</p>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch weather data using the OpenWeather API.</li>
<li>Display the weather data when running a Python script.</li>
<li>Store the data in an AWS S3 bucket for historical tracking and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this guide, you’ll have a fully functional system showcasing key aspects of DevOps principles, including automation, cloud integration, and scalability.</p>

		<p>Every year, React development continues to evolve as new tools, frameworks, libraries, and methodologies emerge to give more modern approaches to development and programming. In 2025, we can expect there to be even more improvements that make a developer&rsquo;s life more streamlined and more manageable. Building modern React apps requires more than just developing functional components. Developers also need to make the best of the most up-to-date technologies if they want to guarantee that their apps are scalable, high-performance, open source and maintainable for other developers to work on.</p>
