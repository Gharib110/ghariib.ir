	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Mozilla remains committed to fostering a secure, agile, and transparent Web PKI ecosystem. The new Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) v3.0, effective March 15, 2025, introduces critical updates to strengthen Certificate Authority (CA) practices and enhance compliance.</p>
<p>A major focus of <strong>MRSP v3.0</strong> is tackling the long-standing challenge of <strong>delayed certificate revocation</strong>—an issue that has historically weakened the security and reliability of TLS certificate management. The updated policy establishes <strong>clearer revocation expectations, improved incident reporting, subscriber education by CAs, revocation planning,</strong> and <strong>automated certificate issuance</strong> to ensure that certificate replacement and revocation can be handled promptly and at scale.</p>
