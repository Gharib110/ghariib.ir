<p>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/tree/master">AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio repo</a> provides an OIDC authentication mechanism that was integrated into the open source Kubeflow project. The adapter uses JWT for authentication, but lacks proper signer and issuer validation. In deployments of ALB that ignore security best practices, where ALB targets are directly exposed to internet traffic, an actor can provide a JWT signed by an untrusted entity in order to spoof OIDC-federated sessions and successfully bypass authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore#validatetokensignature">Amazon.ApplicationLoadBalancer.Identity.AspNetCore repo</a> contains Middleware that can be used in conjunction with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) OpenId Connect integration and can be used in any <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a> Core deployment scenario, including AWS Fargate, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and AWS Lambda. In the JWT handling code, it performs signature validation but fails to validate the JWT issuer and signer identity. The signer omission, if combined with a scenario where the infrastructure owner allows internet traffic to the ALB targets (not a recommended configuration), can allow for JWT signing by an untrusted entity and an actor may be able to mimic valid OIDC-federated sessions to the ALB targets.</p>
