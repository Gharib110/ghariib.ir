<p>Whether it’s staying in touch with family and friends, planning a party, scheduling an event, getting work done, or <a href="/blog/blur-tools/">organizing for change</a>, group chats are an increasingly important part of Signal. Today we’re releasing a new version of Signal groups that gives you a richer private group experience with group admins, granular permissions, @mentions and more. If you’re excited to try out these features now, you can create a new group to do so. These features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups in a future update.</p>

<p>We have been humbled by the amazing response to our recent launch of <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/">Win-KeX</a>. After its initial release, we asked ourselves if that is truly the limit of what we can achieve or could we pull off something incredible to mark the 25th anniversary of Hackers? What about “a second concurrent session as root”, “seamless desktop integration with Windows”, or - dare we dream - “sound”?</p>
