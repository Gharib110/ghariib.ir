<p>Yesterday was a day of meetings. Discussion and debate flourished. Conversations ranged over all parts of every project. Words spoken aloud may have outnumbered lines of code shipped. The entire team was fully engaged and people nearly had to be dragged out of the house for an afternoon hike to the top of the ridge.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code, Day 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prophetic discourse of the Karai can be summed up in an observation and a promise: on the one hand, they constantly affirmed the fundamentally evil character of the world, on the other, they insisted that conquest of a good world was possible. “The world is evil! The world is ugly!” they said. “Let us abandon it!” they concluded. […] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.</p>

<p>I’m not sure those attending their first break of code know what they are getting into. When I said <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/">“sure” to Moxie my first break, I sure didn’t</a>. During that week I had already come to the conclusion “I have to see this (TextSecure iOS) through”. In the intervening time, I’ve become an expert on the <a href="http://codexgalactic.com/2014/01/27/axolotl-protocol-for-cryptographically-secure-messaging/">Axolotl protocol</a>, <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/">come to understand ZRTP</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs">picked up the world’s best collaborator</a>, helped with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8">the final polish of Signal with RedPhone support</a> and contributed <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS/graphs/contributors">a lot of code to the TextSecure prototype</a>.</p>

<p>As it does every morning, the day started with Moxie singing the stand-up song, reminding us all (and waking up the slackers) that at 9am sharp we all get in a circle to discuss what we accomplished the day before and what our priorities are for the coming day.</p>

<p>After being promptly woken up by numerous roosters at 7:30 AM, I still can’t believe I’m here. My application was pretty last-minute, completed when I was in a state of droopiness and scholarship-application-hyperdrive. But I got on a plane from the Midwest, went from cloudy, 20 degrees with windchill making it feel like 0 to sunny, 77 degrees with mild winds making it feel still 77 degrees.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day 1</em></p>
<p>I woke up this morning feeling like this routine was normal, instead of implausible. Two days ago, I was in New York City, riding the train with millions of other commuters in the freezing snow. Today, I went surfing on a beach in beautiful Kauai. In the same absurd fashion, I shared meals, stories, and workspaces with people, who days earlier, I had only read about and admired from afar. The promises of the Winter Break of Code seem impossible: a vacation in paradise, large milestones of work to be met, a welcoming space with talented companions. But when Moxie came into the bedroom this morning strumming his ukulele to wake us for the daily morning stand-up, up we were, ready to claim the small victories in the browser extension project, the Signal iOS client, and the Android applications from the day prior and to lay out plans to further the state of user-friendly secure communication tools.</p>

<p>Privacy is a hot topic at the moment - it continues to dominate the headlines as news of new NSA incursions, celebrity phone hacks, and corporate breaches are being reported on an increasingly regular basis. In response to this, a number of products have been brought to market that attempt to provide consumers with a greater level of privacy than typical devices allow for. In the phone market, one of the premier products to be released in recent years is undoubtedly the BlackPhone (<a href="http://www.blackphone.ch/">http://www.blackphone.ch</a>), which has been cited numerous times in tech publications as being one of the best available defenses against mass surveillance, as it provides full end-to-end encryption facilities for voice calls and text/MMS messaging.</p>

<p>Every year when we do this kind of <a href="/blog/winter-of-code">call for proposals</a>, our experience from past events sets our expectations higher. Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high-quality proposals we received for this winter. It’s inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development of privacy-enhancing technology, and we hope that one day we’ll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals that we wish we could.</p>
