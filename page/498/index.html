		<p>This blog is part of a larger NIST series during the month of October for Cybersecurity Awareness Month , called &lsquo;Staff Stories Spotlight.&rsquo; Throughout the month of October this year, Q&amp;A style blogs will be published featuring some of our unique staff members who have interesting backgrounds, stories to tell, and projects in the world of cybersecurity. This year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month theme is ‘Secure our World.’ How does this theme resonate with you, as someone working in cybersecurity? Now more than ever, the use of technology is central to our lives. It is the means by which we are</p>

	<div>
		<p>The first installment in this series provided a brief introduction to the Cluster Observability Operator (COO). This article serves as a detailed guide for configuring alerts within the COO namespace. In the following sections, I will present specific examples for two structural configurations within the COO monitoring stack.</p>
<h3 id="case-1-one-monitoring-stack-for-multiple-namespace">Case 1: One monitoring stack for multiple namespace. </h3>
<p>Create a namespace to host the COO instance and utilize this monitoring stack to monitor the namespaces <code>coo-ns2</code>, <code>coo-ns3</code>, and <code>coo-ns4</code> as shown in Figures 1 and 2.</p>

		<p>Upgrades are necessary in any industry that relies upon IT infrastructure to do business. From adopting new features and addressing common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) to enhancing security and complying with support requirements, there are many business-critical reasons to upgrade your software infrastructure. This is especially true for service providers operating in rapidly changing market conditions. By offering the fastest network with advanced services and features, upgrades help service providers maintain customer satisfaction, grow revenue, and ensure long-term success. Even so,</p>

		<p>I’ve noticed that many shops are increasingly using e-paper displays. They’re impressive: high contrast, no backlight, and no visible cables. Unlike most electronics, these displays are seamlessly integrated and feel very natural. This got me wondering: is it possible to use such a display for a pet project? I want to experiment with this technology myself.</p>

<p>My main goal in this project is to understand the hardware and its capabilities. Here, I&rsquo;ll be using an e-paper display to show the current weather, but at its core, I’m simply feeding data from a website to the display. While it sounds straightforward, it actually requires three layers of software to pull off. Still, it’s a fun challenge and a great opportunity to work with both embedded hardware and Cloudflare Workers.</p>
