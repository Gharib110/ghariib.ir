<em>Jonas Nick, Liam Eagen, Robin Linus</em></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies allow mutually distrusting users to transact monetary value over the internet without relying on a trusted third party.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, achieved this through a novel protocol used to establish consensus about an ordered transaction history. This requires every transaction to be broadcasted and verified by the network, incurring communication and computational costs. Furthermore, transactions are visible to all nodes of the network, eroding privacy, and are recorded permanently, contributing to increasing storage requirements over time. To limit resource usage of the network, Bitcoin currently supports an average of 11 transactions per second.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>SoK: Multiparty Computation in Preprocessing Model</strong><br>
<em>Shuang Sun, Eleftheria Makri</em></p>
<p>Multiparty computation (MPC) allows a set of mutually distrusting parties to compute a function over their inputs, while keeping those inputs private. Most recent MPC protocols that are ready for real-world applications are based on the so-called preprocessing model, where the MPC is split into two phases: a preprocessing phase, where raw material, independent of the inputs, is produced; and an online phase, which can be efficiently computed, consuming this preprocessed material, when the inputs become available. However, the sheer number of protocols following this paradigm, makes it difficult to navigate through the literature. Our work aims at systematizing existing literature, (1) to make it easier for protocol developers to choose the most suitable preprocessing protocol for their application scenario; and (2) to identify research gaps, so as to give pointers for future work. We devise two main categories for the preprocessing model, which we term traditional and special preprocessing, where the former refers to preprocessing for general purpose functions, and the latter refers to preprocessing for specific functions. We further systematize the protocols based on the underlying cryptographic primitive they use, the mathematical structure they are based on, and for special preprocessing protocols also their target function. For each of the 41 presented protocols, we give the intuition behind their main technical contribution, and we analyze their security properties and relative performance.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>SoK: Trusted setups for powers-of-tau strings</strong><br>
<em>Faxing Wang, Shaanan Cohney, Joseph Bonneau</em></p>
<p>Many cryptographic protocols rely upon an initial emph{trusted setup} to generate public parameters. While the concept is decades old, trusted setups have gained prominence with the advent of blockchain applications utilizing zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), many of which rely on a ``powers-of-tau&rsquo;&rsquo; setup. Because such setups feature a dangerous trapdoor which undermines security if leaked, multiparty protocols are used to prevent the trapdoor from being known by any one party. Practical setups utilize an elaborate public ceremony to build confidence that the setup was not subverted. In this paper, we aim to systematize existing knowledge on trusted setups, drawing the distinction between setup emph{protocols} and emph{ceremonies}, and shed light on the different features of various approaches. We establish a taxonomy of protocols and evaluate real-world ceremonies based on their design principles, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>
