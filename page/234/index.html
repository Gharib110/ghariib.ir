		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Efficient Authentication Protocols from the Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem</strong><br>
<em>Thomas Johansson, Mustafa Khairallah, Vu Nguyen</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce an oracle version of the Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem (RSDP) and propose novel authentication protocols based on the hardness of this problem. They follow the basic structure of the HB-family of authentication protocols and later improvements but demonstrate several advantages. An appropriate choice of multiplicative subgroup and ring structure gives rise to a very efficient hardware implementation compared to other emph{Learning Parity with Noise} based approaches. In addition, the new protocols also have lower key size, lower communication costs, and potentially better completeness/soundness compared to learning-based alternatives. This is appealing in the context of low-cost, low-powered authenticating devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. Lastly, we show that with additional assumptions, RSDP can be used to instantiate a Man-in-the-Middle secured authentication protocol.</p>

I first made this project using Raspberry Pi Zero and Python (link), and then I re-made it using ESP32 and Arduino. My weather dashboard shows the current weather and a bar chart of 5-day high and low temperatures. There&rsquo;s also a menu interface for switching Wi-Fi connections.</p>
<p>Hardware setup: ESP32 paired with a Nextion NX8048T050 HMI touchscreen display on UART2.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather data fetching from Open-Meteo API</li>
<li>Utilizes WiFi library for network connection management</li>
<li>Utilizes Nextion GUI designing commands to draw a 5-day weather bar chart</li>
<li>Automatic location detection via IPInfo.io API</li>
<li>Geocoder for location name resolution via Nominatim API</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to set up all the binaries/elf and RTOS from scratch without using the Arduino framework. I don&rsquo;t know how hard would it be. I hope I&rsquo;ll make it in a few weeks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Extending Groth16 for Disjunctive Statements</strong><br>
<em>Xudong Zhu, Xinxuan Zhang, Xuyang Song, Yi Deng, Yuanju Wei, Liuyu Yang</em></p>
<p>Two most common ways to design non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs are based on Sigma ($Sigma$)-protocols (an efficient way to prove algebraic statements) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocols (an efficient way to prove arithmetic statements). However, in the applications of cryptocurrencies such as privacy-preserving credentials, privacy-preserving audits, and blockchain-based voting systems, the zk-SNARKs for general statements are usually implemented with encryption, commitment, or other algebraic cryptographic schemes. Moreover, zk-SNARKs for many different arithmetic statements may also be required to be implemented together. Clearly, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the code for algebraic part. However, complex cryptographic operations in the algebraic algorithms will significantly increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size. Thus, we need a flexible enough proof system for composite statements including both algebraic and arithmetic statements. Unfortunately, while the conjunction of zk-SNARKs is relatively natural and numerous effective solutions are currently available (e.g. by utilizing the commit-and-prove technique), the disjunction of zk-SNARKs is rarely discussed in detail. In this paper, we mainly focus on the disjunctive statements of Groth16, and we propose a Groth16 variant&mdash;CompGroth16, which provides a framework for Groth16 to prove the disjunctive statements that consist of a mix of algebraic and arithmetic components. Specifically, we could directly combine CompGroth16 with $Sigma$-protocol or even CompGroth16 with CompGroth16 just like the logical composition of $Sigma$-protocols. From this, we can gain many good properties, such as broader expression, better prover&rsquo;s efficiency and shorter CRS. In addition, for the combination of CompGroth16 and $Sigma$-protocol, we also present two representative application scenarios to demonstrate the practicality of our construction.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Foundations of Platform-Assisted Auctions</strong><br>
<em>Hao Chung, Ke Wu, Elaine Shi</em></p>
<p>Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. These platforms serve as a rendezvous point for the buyers and sellers, and charge a fee for its service. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions. Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully, assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits.</p>
