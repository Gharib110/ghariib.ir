<p>In November, we experienced one incident that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.</p>
<p><strong>November 19 10:56 UTC (lasting 1 hour and 7 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>On November 19, 2024, between 10:56:00 UTC and 12:03:00 UTC, the notifications service was degraded and stopped sending notifications to all our dotcom customers. On average, notification delivery was delayed by about one hour. This was due to a database host coming out of a regular maintenance process in read-only mode.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Inspirado neste post, resolvi também escrever um texto do caminho que fiz para conseguir a certificação em Vue.</p>
<p>Trabalho com Vue há 3 anos, e no momento estamos fazendo a transição da aplicação de Vue2 para Vue3, então estudar para a certificação me pareceu um bom caminho para atualizar os conhecimentos no framework.</p>
<p>Se você está começando no mundo do desenvolvimento web, não recomendo que faça a certificação, pois a mesma está custando atualmente quase R$600,00 e e acredito que você consegue extrair mais valor fazendo cursos e outras atividades com este dinheiro. Mas se você já é um profissional experiente e quer colocar seus conhecimentos a prova, exibir o badge de dev Vue e ajudar o desenvolvimento do framework (parte do dinheiro vai para a equipe do Vue), recomendo que o faça.</p>

<p>After a bit too much eggnog, Elliot Williams and Al Williams got together to see what Hackaday had been up to over the holiday. Turns out, quite a bit. There was a lot to cover, but the big surprise was the “What’s that Sound” competition. Do you know who had the correct answer from the last show? No one! So they guys did the right thing and drew from all the entrants for a coveted Hackaday Podcast T-shirt.</p>

		<p>What hardware is needed for security information and event management (SIEM) systems?</p>
<p>At some point, the information security department of any large company inevitably begins to consider introducing a SIEM system — or replacing the existing one, and must therefore estimate the budget required for its deployment. But SIEM isn’t a lightweight product that can be deployed within existing infrastructure. Almost all solutions in this category require additional hardware, meaning that equipment must be purchased or rented.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><em>This post was originally published on Automation.com.</em></p>
<p>As organizations around the globe rapidly adopt AI, it is becoming clear that this transformation brings both significant opportunities and serious risks. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65% of participants said their companies regularly used AI, a dramatic increase in a very short period. This growing reliance on AI is transforming industries, especially in operational technology (OT) sectors like manufacturing and energy, where AI is a critical driver for efficiency and automation. However, it is also becoming a powerful tool for cybercriminals, raising the stakes for OT security.</p>
