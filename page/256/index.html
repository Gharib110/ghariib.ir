		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>SoK: Time to be Selfless?! Demystifying the Landscape of Selfish Mining Strategies and Models</strong><br>
<em>Colin Finkbeiner, Mohamed E. Najd, Julia Guskind, Ghada Almashaqbeh</em></p>
<p>Selfish mining attacks present a serious threat to Bitcoin security, enabling a miner with less than 51% of the network hashrate to gain higher rewards than when mining honestly. A growing body of works has studied the impact of such attacks and presented numerous strategies under a variety of model settings. This led to a complex landscape with conclusions that are often exclusive to certain model assumptions. This growing complexity makes it hard to comprehend the state of the art and distill its impact and trade-offs.</p>

		<p>Recently a reader wrote in and asked if I would look at Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, presumably to give thoughts on it from a privacy perspective. This was honestly the last thing I wanted to do, since life is short and this seemed like an obvious waste of it. Of course a project <em>devoted to literally scanning your eyeballs</em> was up to some bad things, duh.</p>
<p>However: the request got me curious. Against my better judgement, I decided to spend a few hours poking around Worldcoin’s documentation and code — in the hope of rooting out the obvious technical red flags that would lead to the true Bond-villain explanation of the whole thing. Because surely there had to be one. I mean: eyeball scanners. Right?</p>

<p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to simplify the process of building custom user interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS libraries that offer predefined components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that enable developers to create unique designs directly in their markup. This flexibility allows for rapid prototyping and the ability to maintain consistency across projects without sacrificing creativity.</p>

		<p>Add your own personalization to Windows with these free customization tools.</p>
<p>Is your computer just a tool, or is it an expression of yourself? Just like how people once went to extreme lengths to decorate their journals and diaries, you can do the same with your desktop. Programs like Rainmeter have long offered deeper customization options than you might get by default, but Rainmeter doesn&rsquo;t get the love it once did, and it&rsquo;s down to sporadic, few-and-far-between updates.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever gazed at the shoreline of Santos, Brazil, and felt like something was tugging at your inner eye level, you’re not alone. In fact, you’ve spotted one of the world’s most bizarre architectural phenomena.</p>
<p>Santos is an interesting contradiction—it’s a sunny coastal city with pristine beaches that also plays host to a bustling port. What draws the eye, however, is the skyline—it’s decidedly askew. This isn’t a Photoshop job or some avant-garde urban planning experiment, either. It’s a consequence of engineering hubris, poor planning, and geology just doing its thing.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>The Meta-Complexity of Secret Sharing</strong><br>
<em>Benny Applebaum, Oded Nir</em></p>
<p>A secret-sharing scheme allows the distribution of a secret $s$ among $n$ parties, such that only certain predefined “authorized” sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, while all other “unauthorized” sets learn nothing about $s$. The collection of authorized/unauthorized sets is defined by a monotone function $f: {0,1}^n rightarrow {0,1}$. It is known that any monotone function can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme; thus, the smallest achievable emph{total share size}, $S(f)$, serves as a natural complexity measure. In this paper, we initiate the study of the following meta-complexity question: Given a monotone function $f$, is it possible to efficiently distinguish between cases where the secret-sharing complexity of $f$ is small versus large? We examine this question across several computational models, yielding the following main results.</p>

		<p><em>This week on the Lock and Code podcast…</em></p>
<p>The era of artificial intelligence everything is here, and with it, come everyday surprises into exactly where the next AI tools might pop up.</p>
<p>There are major corporations pushing customer support functions onto AI chatbots, Big Tech platforms offering AI image generation for social media posts, and even Google has defaulted to include AI-powered overviews into everyday searches.</p>
<p>The next gold rush, it seems, is in AI, and for a group of technical and legal researchers at New York University and Cornell University, that could be a major problem.</p>
