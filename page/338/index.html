<p>Today, development teams suffer from a lack of automation for time-consuming tasks, the absence of standardization due to an overabundance of tool options, and insufficiently mature DevSecOps processes. This leads to frustrating bottlenecks for developers attempting to build and deliver software. For multinational enterprises, the cost of all that toil, complexity, and frustration multiplies exponentially due to the size of those organizations. In such contexts, platform engineering offers a compelling solution to enable business competitiveness in a manner that significantly enhances the developer experience. A central element of platform engineering teams is a robust Internal Developer Platform (IDP), which encompasses a set of tools, services, and infrastructure that enables developers to build, test, and deploy software applications.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the Independence Assumption in Quasi-Cyclic Code-Based Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Maxime Bombar, Nicolas Resch, Emiel Wiedijk</em></p>
<p>Cryptography based on the presumed hardness of decoding codes &ndash; i.e., code-based cryptography &ndash; has recently seen increased interest due to its plausible security against quantum attackers. Notably, of the four proposals for the NIST post-quantum standardization process that were advanced to their fourth round for further review, two were code-based. The most efficient proposals &ndash; including HQC and BIKE, the NIST submissions alluded to above &ndash; in fact rely on the presumed hardness of decoding structured codes. Of particular relevance to our work, HQC is based on quasi-cyclic codes, which are codes generated by matrices consisting of two cyclic blocks.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Managing compliance across a sprawling cloud environment can be overwhelming. This is where <strong>AWS Config Conformance Packs</strong> shine. These are pre-packaged sets of AWS Config rules and remediation actions designed to help you meet specific compliance frameworks or organizational standards with minimal effort.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-conformance-packs">What Are Conformance Packs?</h3>
<p>Conformance Packs simplify compliance management by bundling AWS Config rules into reusable templates. These templates can be applied across multiple accounts and regions, ensuring consistent governance and compliance.</p>

		<p>What to expect in 2025: the rise of AI, new scams, and a potential social-media ban</p>
<p>Every year, Kaspersky experts briefly turn into soothsayers. No, our colleagues don’t reach for crystal balls, tarot cards or horoscopes to see into the cybersecurity future; their predictions are based on an analysis of the global trends and threats we encounter in our daily work.</p>
<p>And they’re often spot-on: for 2024, we predicted a rise in scams tied to play-to-earn (P2E) games, the proliferation of voice deepfakes, and other trends.</p>

		<p><strong>In the new year, we’ll be making moves towards strengthening Microsoft and our customers’ security posture in regards to the usage and creation of personal access tokens (PATs).</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been following this blog, you may have noticed we’ve been distancing away from PATs as the recommended authentication method for Azure DevOps APIs by offering restrictive policies and more secure alternatives. PATs can be an enticing vector for unauthorized access, especially when insecurely stored, over-scoped, or set for long durations.</p>

<p>Dynatrace guides you in quickly getting the most valuable service level objectives (SLOs) set up in just a few clicks. To provide maximum freedom in selecting the service-level indicators that matter most to your business, Dynatrace combines SLOs with the power of Dynatrace Grail™ data lakehouse, the central data platform with heterogeneous and contextually linked data. Service-level objectives now utilize highly flexible Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) for all Grail data sources. This lets you build your SLOs around the indicators that matter to you and your customers—critical metrics related to availability, failure rates, request response times, or select logs and business events.</p>
