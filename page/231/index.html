<p>In an increasingly globalized world, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) often find themselves navigating a maze of visa rules, travel guidelines, and cultural adjustments across different countries. While the internet offers a wealth of information, it can often be scattered, outdated, or irrelevant to specific NRI needs. Enter <strong>Desi NRI</strong>, a platform that has been transforming the way NRIs access critical information, share experiences, and make informed decisions about travel, visas, and much more.</p>

		<p>In the next few years, a growing number of organizations across Europe will face investigations for non-compliance with the NIS2 Directive. If they are found to have poor cybersecurity practices, they may well be forced to pay multi-million Euro fines and other penalties. The best way to manage the risk of NIS2 penalties is, of […]</p>

<p>The post How we evaluate AI models and LLMs for GitHub Copilot appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>There are so many AI models to choose from these days. From the proprietary foundation models of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to the smaller, more open options from the likes of Meta and Mistral. It’s tempting to hop immediately to the latest models. But just because a model is newer doesn’t mean it will perform better for your use case.</p>

		<p>Who claimed quantum supremacy and decryption on quantum computers?</p>
<p>Quantum computers remain a highly exotic technology, used by a very small number of companies for very specific computational tasks. But if you search for “quantum computer news”, you might get the impression that all the major IT players have already armed themselves with quantum technology, and that any day now hackers will start using it to crack encrypted communications and manipulate digital signatures. The reality is both less tense and more complex — but such nuances don’t make the headlines. So, who’s been making all the noise about quantum hacking?…</p>

		<p>With the right hardware and OS, even a Raspberry Pi can serve as solid daily driver</p>
<p>Over the years, SBCs have seen significant improvements in both processing capabilities and software compatibility. Modern-day Single-Board Computers have become versatile enough to power a wide variety of projects. This trend also extends to the Raspberry Pi series, with the RPi 5 packing enough firepower to run full-fledged desktop operating systems.</p>

<p>The RP2040 has quickly become a hot favorite with tinkerers and makers since its release in early 2021. This is largely attributed to the low cost, fast GPIOs, and plethora of bus peripherals. [xyphro] has written the I3C Blaster firmware that helps turn the Raspberry Pi Pico into a USB to I3C converter.</p>
<p>The firmware is essentially a bit-bang wrapper and exposes an interactive shell with a generous command set. But it is a lot more than that. [xyphro] has taken the time to dive into the I3C implementation standard and the code is a fairly complex state-machine that is a story on its own.</p>

		<p>In keeping with our commitment to the security and privacy of individuals on the internet, Mozilla is increasing our oversight and adding automation to our compliance-checking of publicly trusted intermediate CA certificates (“intermediate certificates”). This improvement in automation is important because intermediate certificates play a critical part in the web PKI (Public-Key Infrastructure). Intermediate CA keys directly sign server certificates, and we currently recognize nearly 3,000 intermediate certificates, which chain up to approximately 150 root CA certificates embedded as trust anchors in NSS and Firefox. More specifically, we are updating the Mozilla Root Store Policy (MRSP) and associated guidance, improving the public review of third-party intermediate certificates on the Mozilla dev-security-policy list, and enhancing automation in the Common CA Database (CCADB).</p>

		<p>Hello everyone! I’m new here and looking for some feedback on a thought I’ve had recently. I’ve been exploring the cryptocurrency market and came across an interesting trend: memecoins. A while ago, a Brazilian adult content creator launched a memecoin called &lsquo;bct&rsquo; (short for &lsquo;pussy&rsquo; in Portuguese), and she made a significant profit from it. This got me thinking: what if other adult content creators started their own memecoins? With the rise of online content creation as a career, these creators have massive influence, and it seems like an untapped niche in the crypto world. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this—could this be a viable new market for creators?</p>

<p>Recently a video surfaced from someone claiming that certain USB-to-Ethernet dongles contained ‘malware’ among other big claims. Basically these dongles were said to be designed by China (and Russia) to spy on users and so on, but how much of this is actually grounded in reality? When [lcamtuf] dove into the topic, what he found was not so much a smoking gun, but rather a curious relic from the era when drivers-on-CD were being phased out.</p>
