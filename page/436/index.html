	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>BBQSQL is a blind SQL injection framework written in Python. It is extremely useful when attacking tricky SQL injection vulnerabilities. BBQSQL is also a semi-automatic tool, allowing quite a bit of customization for those hard to trigger SQL injection findings. The tool is built to be database agnostic and is extremely versatile. It also has […]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Cloudflare announced Stream Live for open beta in 2021, and in 2022 we went GA. While we talked about the experience of using it and the value it delivers to customers, we didn’t talk about how we built it. So let’s talk about Stream Live’s design, and how it leverages the distributed nature of Cloudflare’s network, rather than centralized locations as many other live services do. Ultimately, our goals are to keep our content ingest as close to broadcasters as possible, our content delivery as close to viewers as possible, and to retain our ability to handle unexpected use cases.</p>

	<div>
		<p>BEURK is an userland preload rootkit for GNU/Linux, heavily focused around anti-debugging and anti-detection. Being a userland rootkit it gives limited privileges (whatever the user has basically) vs a superuser or root level rootkit. Features Hide attacker files and directories Realtime log cleanup (on utmp/wtmp) Anti process and login detection Bypass unhide, lsof, ps, ldd, […]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>An ongoing fake Google Chrome update effort targeting France has been noticed, which spreads WarmCookie malware via compromised websites. WarmCookie is a Windows malware that is used to obtain system access through phishing operations.</p>
<p>It is a two-stage backdoor intended to spread more payloads and examine target networks. It most commonly spreads through phishing efforts that impersonate job offers.</p>
<p>Warm cookies can be used as fingerprint machines, take screenshots, exfiltrate stolen data, read and write files, and interact with a command and control (C&amp;C) server to get commands.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are cyberattacks that aim to overwhelm and disrupt online services, making them inaccessible to users. By leveraging a network of distributed devices, DDoS attacks flood the target system with excessive requests, consuming its bandwidth or exhausting compute resources to the point of failure. These attacks can be highly effective against unprotected sites and relatively inexpensive for attackers to launch. Despite being one of the oldest types of attacks, DDoS attacks remain a constant threat, often targeting well-known or high traffic websites, services, or critical infrastructure. Cloudflare has mitigated over 14.5 million DDoS attacks since the start of 2024 — an average of 2,200 DDoS attacks per hour. (Our DDoS Threat Report for Q3 2024 contains additional related statistics).</p>

	<div>
		<p>OpenAI announced support for WebRTC in their Realtime API on December 17, 2024. Combining their Realtime API with Cloudflare Calls allows you to build experiences that weren’t possible just a few days earlier.</p>
<p>Previously, interactions with audio and video AIs were largely <em>single-player</em>: only one person could be interacting with the AI unless you were in the same physical room. Now, applications built using Cloudflare Calls and OpenAI’s Realtime API can now support multiple users across the globe simultaneously seeing and interacting with a voice or video AI.</p>

<p>For many of us, when we think of creating a custom enclosure, our minds immediately go towards our 3D printer. A bit of time in your CAD program of choice, and in an hour (or several), you’ve got a bespoke plastic box. A hacker’s dream come true.</p>
<p>But extruded plastic is hardly perfect. For one thing, you might want a finished piece that looks a little more attractive on your desk. Which is why we appreciate this quick hack from [Tilma]. When faced with a broken LED light and minimal equipment, he decided to transplant the repaired electronics into a scratch-built wooden frame that not only looks better than the original, but is more functional.</p>

		<p>It seems this year bug bounties are getting really serious, especially on the secondary market involving exploit trading firms, not direct to the software producer or owner. $500,000 isn’t chump change and would be a good year for a small security team, especially living somewhere with a weaker currency. Even for a solo security researcher […]</p>
