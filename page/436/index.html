	<div>
		<p>An ongoing fake Google Chrome update effort targeting France has been noticed, which spreads WarmCookie malware via compromised websites. WarmCookie is a Windows malware that is used to obtain system access through phishing operations.</p>
<p>It is a two-stage backdoor intended to spread more payloads and examine target networks. It most commonly spreads through phishing efforts that impersonate job offers.</p>
<p>Warm cookies can be used as fingerprint machines, take screenshots, exfiltrate stolen data, read and write files, and interact with a command and control (C&amp;C) server to get commands.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are cyberattacks that aim to overwhelm and disrupt online services, making them inaccessible to users. By leveraging a network of distributed devices, DDoS attacks flood the target system with excessive requests, consuming its bandwidth or exhausting compute resources to the point of failure. These attacks can be highly effective against unprotected sites and relatively inexpensive for attackers to launch. Despite being one of the oldest types of attacks, DDoS attacks remain a constant threat, often targeting well-known or high traffic websites, services, or critical infrastructure. Cloudflare has mitigated over 14.5 million DDoS attacks since the start of 2024 — an average of 2,200 DDoS attacks per hour. (Our DDoS Threat Report for Q3 2024 contains additional related statistics).</p>

		<p>OpenAI announced support for WebRTC in their Realtime API on December 17, 2024. Combining their Realtime API with Cloudflare Calls allows you to build experiences that weren’t possible just a few days earlier.</p>
<p>Previously, interactions with audio and video AIs were largely <em>single-player</em>: only one person could be interacting with the AI unless you were in the same physical room. Now, applications built using Cloudflare Calls and OpenAI’s Realtime API can now support multiple users across the globe simultaneously seeing and interacting with a voice or video AI.</p>

<p>For many of us, when we think of creating a custom enclosure, our minds immediately go towards our 3D printer. A bit of time in your CAD program of choice, and in an hour (or several), you’ve got a bespoke plastic box. A hacker’s dream come true.</p>
<p>But extruded plastic is hardly perfect. For one thing, you might want a finished piece that looks a little more attractive on your desk. Which is why we appreciate this quick hack from [Tilma]. When faced with a broken LED light and minimal equipment, he decided to transplant the repaired electronics into a scratch-built wooden frame that not only looks better than the original, but is more functional.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It seems this year bug bounties are getting really serious, especially on the secondary market involving exploit trading firms, not direct to the software producer or owner. $500,000 isn’t chump change and would be a good year for a small security team, especially living somewhere with a weaker currency. Even for a solo security researcher […]</p>

		<p>One of the most critical gaps in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they rely on static knowledge already contained within them. Basically, they might be very good at understanding and responding to prompts, but they often fall short in providing current or highly specific information. This is where Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) comes in;  RAG addresses these critical gaps in traditional LLMs by incorporating current and new information that serves as a reliable source of truth for these models. </p>
