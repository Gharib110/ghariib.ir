		<p>In today&rsquo;s competitive landscape, businesses must innovate quickly and deliver exceptional customer value. AWS DevOps has emerged as a powerful enabler, combining the best practices of development and operations with the scalability and reliability of the AWS cloud.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-awsdevops">What is AWS DevOps?</h2>
<p>AWS DevOps integrates tools, automation, and cultural practices to streamline software development and deployment. By leveraging AWS services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CloudFormation, teams can implement continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), automate infrastructure provisioning, and improve collaboration between developers and operations teams.</p>

		<p>This article was originally published on Rails Designer Build a SaaS</p>
<p>This is the third article on Building a SaaS with Ruby on Rails. This article continues where the previous one, adding sign up to Rails 8&rsquo; authentication, stops.</p>
<p>Most SaaS products are used by multiple people from the same team or company. Although I would, when you start building your SaaS, urge you to keep it simple and just support one user on launch. I would álso urge you to build the blocks needed for teams in your app from the get-go. Having to deal with workspaces, teams and roles when you already have users is a bigger pain than you can imagine.</p>

	<div>
		<p>One of the first things everyone predicted when artificial intelligence (AI) became more commonplace was that it would assist cybercriminals in making their phishing campaigns more effective.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have conducted a scientific study into the effectiveness of AI supported spear phishing, and the results line up with everyone’s expectations: AI is making it easier to do crimes.</p>
<p>The study, titled Evaluating Large Language Models’ Capability to Launch Fully Automated Spear Phishing Campaigns: Validated on Human Subjects, evaluates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to conduct personalized phishing attacks and compares their performance with human experts and AI models from last year.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is a network virtualization technique allowing traffic isolation at the layer 3 (L3) of the OSI model by creating independent routing and forwarding domains. It is essentially the combination of a separate routing table and associated network interfaces.</p>
<p>Other networking techniques exist but are operating at a different levels—such as VLAN and network namespaces, respectively at the layer 2 and at the device level. Those techniques can be combined, e.g., a VRF can be part of a network namespace and/or VLANs can be attached to a VRF. Note that a network namespace might look like a way to emulate a VRF but they differ in how traffic is handled, notably VRF does not impact layer 2 (L2) traffic.</p>

<p>The autonomous SOC: A well-grounded vision for the future of machine speed, AI-driven cyber defense, or nothing more than a pipe dream? Few concepts in modern security have been as polarizing, with sides painted as distinct camps of “believers” versus “non-believers”, each accompanied by increasingly hyperbolic claims.</p>
<p>At SentinelOne, you will hear us and our customers talk about the autonomous SOC and the fundamental shifts it will bring to day-to-day security operations. Today, we want to be clear about what we mean when we say that.</p>

		<p>A security flaw has been discovered in Microsoft’s Azure App Service that exposed source code for customer applications written in Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby for at least four years since September 2017.</p>
<p>According to Wiz researchers, the vulnerability, codenamed “Not Legit,” was first reported to the tech giant on October 7, 2021, and mitigations were implemented to fix the bug in November. Microsoft said “a limited subset of customers” are at risk. “Customers who deployed code to App Service Linux via Local Git after files had already been created in the application are the only impacted customers.”</p>

<p>Imagine a clock where the colors aren’t from LEDs but a physics phenomenon – polarization. That’s just what [Mosivers], a physicist and electronics enthusiast, has done with the Polarizer Clock. It’s not a perfect build, but the concept is intriguing: using polarized light and stress-induced birefringence to generate colors without resorting to RGB LEDs.</p>
<p>The clock uses white LEDs to edge-illuminate a polycarbonate plate. This light passes through two polarizers—one fixed, one rotating—creating constantly shifting colours. Sounds fancy, but the process involves more trial and error than you’d think. [Mosivers] initially wanted to use polarizer-cut numbers but found the contrast was too weak. He experimented with materials like Tesa tape and cellophane, choosing polycarbonate for its stress birefringence.</p>
