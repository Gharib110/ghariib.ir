		<p>Technical and organizational precautions when deploying existing AI systems and developing new ones</p>
<p>Today, AI-based technologies are already being used in every second company — with another 33% of commercial organizations expected to join them in the next two years. AI, in one form or another, will soon be ubiquitous. The economic benefits of adopting AI range from increased customer satisfaction to direct revenue growth. As businesses deepen their understanding of AI systems’ strengths and weaknesses, their effectiveness will only improve. However, it’s already clear that the risks associated with AI adoption need to be addressed proactively.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This article is an overview of memory management in Java. It explains key components of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), including the stack, heap, and garbage collection.</p>
<p>Memory management in Java is essential for various reasons. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automates memory handling by utilizing stack, heap, and garbage collection system. This lightens the load on developers by taking care of memory allocation and deallocation. Nonetheless, developers can not overlook memory management entirely. See the definitions for JVM, stack, heap, and garbage collection at the end of the post.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The Internet is designed to provide multiple paths between two endpoints. Attempts to exploit multi-path opportunities are almost as old as the Internet, culminating in RFCs documenting some of the challenges. Still, today, virtually all end-to-end communication uses only one available path at a time. Why? It turns out that in multi-path setups, even the smallest differences between paths can harm the connection quality due to packet reordering and other issues. As a result, Internet devices usually use a single path and let the routers handle the path selection.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Ref : <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764">https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764</a></p>
<p>So Meta FAIR&rsquo;s new paper is a banger as always coming from them lol. This one is about increasing model capabilities but with fewer FLOPs spent for the same or more number of parameters basically. What they changed is where the FLOPs (computation in GPU terms , we AI folks like to call it that way).</p>
<p>So in traditional architecture, you got the input converted to a vector representation and the attention heads transforms them to imbue them with context within the input and then this transformed input is passed to the MLP, this is the actual Neural net that has in its parameters the reasoning and memory both encoded. As the input vector passes through each layer, the input is transformed with a bit of reasoning and knowledge that the model learnt during the course of its learning. Then we do this for a bunch of times and in the end the vector represents the next token that should be part of the input. Pretty standard. Neat.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>How the Nearest Neighbor tactic can be used in remote attacks on an organization&rsquo;s wireless network — and how to protect yourself against this threat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of information security, wireless networks are typically perceived as something that can be accessed only locally — to connect to them, an attacker needs to be physically close to the access point. This significantly limits their use in attacks on organizations, and so they are perceived as relatively risk-free. It’s easy to think that some random hacker on the internet could never simply connect to a corporate Wi-Fi network. However, the newly emerged Nearest Neighbor attack tactic demonstrates that this perception is not entirely accurate.</p>
