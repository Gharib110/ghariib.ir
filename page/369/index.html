		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Wave Hello to Privacy: Efficient Mixed-Mode MPC using Wavelet Transforms</strong><br>
<em>JosÃ© Reis, Mehmet Ugurbil, Sameer Wagh, Ryan Henry, Miguel de Vega</em></p>
<p>This paper introduces new protocols for secure multiparty computation (MPC) leveraging Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWTs) for computing nonlinear functions over large domains. By employing DWTs, the protocols significantly reduce the overhead typically associated with Lookup Table-style (LUT) evaluations in MPC. We state and prove foundational results for DWT-compressed LUTs in MPC, present protocols for 9 of the most common activation functions used in ML, and experimentally evaluate the performance of our protocols for large domain sizes in the LAN and WAN settings. Our protocols are extremely fast &ndash; for instance, when considering 64-bit inputs, computing 1000 parallel instances of the sigmoid function, with an error less than $2^{-24}$ takes only a few hundred milliseconds incurs just 29,KiB of online communication (40 bytes per evaluation).</p>

		<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>We can hardly believe it, but VirusTotal is turning 20 on June 1st! As we sit down to write this, weâ€™re filled with a mix of pride and gratitude. It&rsquo;s been an incredible journey, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be here without the amazing community that has supported us every step of the way.</p>
<p>When we started VirusTotal, our goal was simple: to help make the internet a safer place. We never imagined that two decades later, we&rsquo;d be here celebrating this milestone with all of you. From the early days to now, it&rsquo;s always been about working together. Whether you&rsquo;re a user, a contributor, or a supporter, you&rsquo;ve played a crucial role in our success.</p>

<p>Apparently, Stefan and I trying to work stuff out in real time about how to build more efficient features in HIBP is entertaining watching! If I was to guess, I think it&rsquo;s just seeing people work through the logic of how things work and how we might be able to approach things differently, and doing it in real time very candidly. I&rsquo;m totally happy doing that, and the comments from the audience did give us more good food for thought too. I&rsquo;ll try and line up a session just like that before the end of the year, we&rsquo;ve certainly got no shortage of material!</p>

<p>Firstly, my apologies for the minute and a bit of echo at the start of this video, OBS had somehow magically decided to start recording both the primary mic and the one built into my camera. Easy fix, moving on&hellip;</p>
<p>During the livestream, I was perplexed as to why the HIBP DB was suddenly maxing out. Turns out that this aligned with <em>dropping</em> a constraint on the table of domains which appears to have caused the table to reindex and massively slow down the queries for breached email addresses. Further, we simultaneously started having problems related to MAXDOP (the maximum degree of parallelism for the stored procedure running the query), which was only resolved after we forced it to <em>not</em> run on multiple CPUs by setting it to 1 (weirdly, 2 is also fine but 3 or higher completely killed perf). Fun times, running a service like this.</p>

<p>I have really clear memories of listening to the Stack Overflow podcast in the late 2000&rsquo;s and hearing Jeff and Joel talk about the various challenges they were facing and the things they did to overcome them. I just suddenly thought of that when realising how long this week&rsquo;s video went for with no real plan other than to talk about our HIBP backlog. People seem to love this in the same way I loved listening to the guys a decade and a half ago. I&rsquo;ll do one of these with Stefan as well over the course of this month, let us know what you&rsquo;d like to hear about ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>This was a much longer than usual update, largely due to the amount of time spent discussing the Earth 2 incident. As I said in the video (many times!), the amount of attention this has garnered from both Earth 2 users and the company itself is incommensurate with the impact of the incident itself. It&rsquo;s a nothing-burger. Email addresses and usernames, that&rsquo;s it, and of course, their association with the service, which may lead to some very targeted spam or phishing attempts. It&rsquo;s still a breach by any reasonable definition of the term, but it should have been succinctly summarised and disclosed to impacted parties with everyone moving on with more important things in life a few moments later. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do right now ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>I have absolutely no problem at all talking about the code I&rsquo;ve screwed up. Perhaps that&rsquo;s partly because after 3 decades of writing software (and doing some meaningful stuff along the way), I&rsquo;m not particularly concerned about showing my weaknesses. And this week, I screwed up a bunch of stuff; database queries that weren&rsquo;t resilient to SQL database scale changes, partially completed breach notifications I didn&rsquo;t notice until it was too late to easily fix, and some queries that performed so badly they crashed the entire breach notification process after loading the massive DemandScience incident. Fortunately, none of them had any impact of note, we fixed them all and re-ran processes, and now we&rsquo;re more resilient than ever ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>I was going to write about how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; with the HIBP API, but somehow, that term doesn&rsquo;t really seem appropriate any more for a service of this scale. On the contrary, we&rsquo;re putting in huge amounts of effort to get this thing fast, stable, and sustainable. We could do the first two very easily just by throwing money at the cloud, but that makes the last one a bit hard. Besides, both StefÃ¡nÂ and I do enjoy the challenge of optimising an increasingly large system to run on a shoestring and even though the days of &ldquo;a coffee a day of running costs&rdquo; are well behind us, arguably the cost per request (or some other usage-based metric) is better than ever. I hope you enjoy this chat between the two of us and as I say in the video, do please chime in with your thoughts and suggestions.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is a list of my <em>favourite</em> breaches from this year as that&rsquo;s a bit of a disingenuous term, but oh boy were there some memorable ones. So many of the incidents I deal with are relatively benign in terms of either the data they expose or the nature of the service, but some of them this year were absolute zingers. This week, I&rsquo;m talking about the ones that really stuck out to me for one reason or another, here&rsquo;s the top 5:</p>

<p>A super quick intro today as I rush off to do the next very Dubai thing: drive a Lambo through the desert to go dirt bike riding before jumping in a Can-Am off-roader and then heading to the kart track for a couple of afternoon sessions. I post lots of pics to my Facebook account, and if none of that is interesting, here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s video on more infosec-related topics:</p>
