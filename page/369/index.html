		<p>Don&rsquo;t let dust and other particles beat you and your mighty system.</p>
<p>Dust is your PC&rsquo;s worst nightmare. It infiltrates the chassis, lands on a component, and starts to accumulate over time. Too much dust can create a layer of insulation, causing the hardware to run hotter than usual. Clogging up fans could result in less air being forced through vents and the performance of everything inside your PC will be compromised. Luckily, keeping dust outside your PC, or at least keeping on top of the stuff that makes it inside your system, is easier than you may think.</p>

		<p>Struggling with Windows Updates? Learn 6 quick and easy fixes to resolve common update issues.</p>
<p>Windows Updates are essential for keeping your computer secure and up to date. However, sometimes you may face problems while updating Windows, such as a failed installation, a stuck update, or the update button not working. Update issues are often frustrating because there’s no apparent cause for them. Thankfully, there are several steps that you can take to fix the issue and get Windows updating again.</p>

		<p>The electricity grid – the buzzing, crackling marvel that supplies the lifeblood of modernity - is by far the largest structure humanity ever built. It’s so big, in fact, that few people even notice it, like a fish can’t see the ocean.</p>
<p>Until the grid goes down, that is. Then, like the fish dangling from the angler’s hook, we see our vulnerability. Modernity dissolves into a sudden silence, followed by the repeated flick of a light switch, and a howl of panic at the prospect of missed appointmen</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security</strong><br>
<em>Anandarup Roy, Bimal Kumar Roy, Kouichi Sakurai, Suprita Talnikar</em></p>
<p>This article explores the potential of Secret Sharing-Based Internet of Things (SBIoT) as a promising cryptographic element across diverse applications, including secure data storage in commercial cloud systems (Datachest), smart home environments (encompassing sensors, cameras, smart locks, and smart assistants), and e-health applications (protecting patient data and medical records). Beyond these applications, the paper makes two key contributions: the introduction of a novel cheater identification algorithm designed to verify the correct submission of shares during secret reconstruction, and empirical validation through experimental studies to support the theoretical advancements. This multifaceted approach not only demonstrates the versatility of SBIoT but also proposes innovative mechanisms to enhance security and integrity, contributing to the development of a more robust cryptographic framework. This article expands upon the work presented in the poster &ldquo;A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security&rdquo; at IWSEC 2023, Yokohama, Japan.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Note on the Minimality of One-Way Functions in Post-Quantum Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Sam Buxbaum, Mohammad Mahmoody</em></p>
<p>In classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) play a central role as the minimal primitive that (almost) all primitives imply. The situation is more complicated in quantum cryptography, in which honest parties and adversaries can use quantum computation and communication, and it is known that analogues of OWFs in the quantum setting might not be minimal.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Survey to Zero-Knowledge Interactive Verifiable Computing: Utilizing Randomness in Low-Degree Polynomials</strong><br>
<em>Angold Wang</em></p>
<p>This survey provides a comprehensive examination of zero-knowledge interactive verifiable computing, emphasizing the utilization of randomnes in low-degree polynomials. We begin by tracing the evolution of general-purpose verifiable computing, starting with the foundational concepts of complexity theory developed in the 1980s, including classes such as P, NP and NP-completeness. Through an exploration of the Cook-Levin Theorem and the transformation between NP problems like HAMPATH and SAT, we demonstrate the reducibility of NP problems to a unified framework, laying the groundwork for subsequent advancements.</p>
