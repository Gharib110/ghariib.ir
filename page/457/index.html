Loupe (aka Image Viewer) is GNOME’s modern successor to the venerable Eye of GNOME has picked up its first batch of image editing features. The features in question were only recently merged upstream, aren’t finished, and not yet included in a stable build. But they’re an interesting addition that furthers the likelihood that Loupe could become the default image viewer on Ubuntu. At present, Ubuntu continues to use Eye of GNOME as the default tool for opening and browsing image files on desktop, despite Loupe having officially replaced it upstream in the GNOME project as a GNOME Core app. Loupe […]</p>

<p>Back in 2021, we covered the antics of Grinch Bots and how the combination of proposed regulation and technology could prevent these malicious programs from stealing holiday cheer.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2024 — the Stop Grinch Bots Act of 2021 has not passed, and bots are more active and powerful than ever, leaving businesses to fend off increasingly sophisticated attacks on their own. During Black Friday 2024, Cloudflare observed:</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In today’s complex cybersecurity landscape, organizations face a critical challenge when security incidents occur: determining when and how to report to regulators and other oversight bodies. This decision can have significant implications for compliance, reputation, and legal liability. A virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) can provide invaluable assistance in navigating these waters. Here’s how:</p>
<h2 id="1-regulatory-expertise"> 1. Regulatory Expertise</h2>
<p>A vCISO brings deep knowledge of various regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and industry-specific regulations. They stay current on reporting requirements and can quickly assess which regulations apply to your specific incident.</p>

		<p><em>This ongoing</em> <em>Docker Labs GenAI series</em> <em>explores the exciting space of AI developer tools. At Docker, we believe there is a vast scope to explore, openly and without the hype. We will share our explorations and collaborate with the developer community in real time. Although developers have adopted autocomplete tooling like GitHub Copilot and use chat, there is significant potential for AI tools to assist with more specific tasks and interfaces throughout the entire software lifecycle. Therefore, our exploration will be broad. We will be releasing software as open source so you can play, explore, and hack with us, too.</em></p>
