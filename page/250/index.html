<p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence is transforming cybersecurity, offering unprecedented opportunities to defend against increasingly complex and automated threats. AI is no longer a support tool—it’s emerging as a central pillar of modern security strategies. From detecting anomalies and automating threat responses to augmenting security teams, AI is enabling defenders to act faster, scale their operations, and outpace attackers. However, as the technology advances, significant challenges remain, from adversarial AI to the cultural inertia of legacy systems.</p>

<p>Advanced Intuit Password Recovery received a major overhaul, adding support for Intuit QuickBooks 2024. For QuickBooks’ annual update, we are excited to provide the complete solution for safe, instant, unconditional password removal. This enhancement addresses a persistent issue in earlier versions, making user management more reliable and efficient for users, IT professionals, and digital forensic specialists.</p>
<h2 id="the-tool">The Tool</h2>
<p>The tool we’re talking about is Advanced Intuit Password Recovery, a lightweight computer forensic product designed to recover lost or forgotten passwords for Intuit Quicken and QuickBooks files. It supports a wide range of Quicken versions from 2006 through 2022 and QuickBooks versions from 2006 through 2023 (and now also 2024), including many international and localized variants. For breaking Quicken passwords, the software is equipped with advanced hardware acceleration, utilizing last-generation NVIDIA video cards to speed up the password recovery process, while QuickBook passwords are subject to instant removal. It can unlock password-protected Quicken .QDF and QuickBooks .QBW files, making it an essential tool for IT professionals managing financial data.</p>

		<p>Insurance company Allstate and its subsidiary Arity unlawfully collected, used, and sold data about the location and movement of Texans’ cell phones through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.</p>
<p>Attorney General Paxton says the companies didn’t give consumers notice or get their consent, which violates Texas’ new Data Privacy and Security Act.</p>
<p>Arity would pay app developers to incorporate software that tracks consumers’ driving data in their apps. When consumers installed these apps they unwittingly downloaded that software, which allowed Arity to monitor the consumer’s location and movement in real-time.</p>

<p>In the latest update of Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery (EDPR), we’ve introduced a revamped load-balancing feature. The new feature aims to enhance resource utilization on local workstations across diverse hardware configurations. This update has drastically reduced the time required to break passwords in certain hardware configurations, thanks to a refined load distribution algorithm. In this article, we’ll share some technical details on how load balancing leverages a mix of GPUs and CPU cores.</p>

		<p>Many organizations use Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization to manage and deploy virtualized workloads alongside containerized ones on the same unified OpenShift platform. For those prioritizing virtualization, Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine, a new edition of OpenShift, provides a dedicated option focused entirely on virtualization workloads. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling virtual machines by removing non-virtualization capabilities that they may not currently need. This targeted approach ensures teams can maximize the value of OpenShift Virtualization while</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of mobile forensics, where extracting data is the first (and arguably the most critical) step. Whether you’re working with an ancient Apple device or attempting to break into the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, there is a method for every gadget – each with its own share of challenges. We love explaining the differences between the extraction techniques, detailing their pros and contras, but sometimes you are limited to the one and only method that is the most likely to succeed.</p>

		<p>This blog is reserved for more serious things, and ordinarily I wouldn’t spend time on questions like the above. But much as I’d like to spend my time writing about exciting topics, sometimes the world requires a bit of what Brad Delong calls “Intellectual Garbage Pickup,” namely: correcting wrong, or mostly-wrong ideas that spread unchecked across the Internet.</p>
<p>This post is inspired by the recent and concerning news that Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov has been arrested by French authorities for its failure to sufficiently moderate content. While I don’t know the details, the use of criminal charges to coerce social media companies is a pretty worrying escalation, and I hope there’s more to the story.</p>
