<h2 id="what-is-ransomware">What is Ransomware?</h2>
<p>Ransomware is a malicious application that locks a person’s data, which is impossible to access until they pay money. Cybercriminals get into systems through phishing emails, software weaknesses, or more sophisticated techniques such as session hijacking.</p>
<h2 id="statistics-of-surge-in-ransomware-groups-and-attacks">Statistics of Surge in Ransomware Groups and Attacks</h2>
<p>Ransomware is more of a threat in 2024 compared to the present. Such attacks are becoming more frequent, and so is their complexity. Moreover, the cost of such attacks is increasing. Here are some vital facts and insights about this looming threat:</p>

<p>Dumpster diving is one of those experiences that can net you some pretty cool gear for a reasonable price. Case in point the 24″ Samsung S24E650XW LCD monitor that [MisterHW] saved from being trashed. Apparently in very good condition with no visible external damage, the unit even powered up without issues. It seemed like a golden find until he got onto the Windows desktop and began to notice quaint red shimmering in darker areas and other issues that made it clear why the monitor had been tossed. Of course, the second best part about dumpster diving is seeing whether you can repair such issues.</p>

		<p>For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest a total of 7 electric vehicle chargers have been selected. One of these is the Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial (MAXI US AC W12-L-4G) which also made an appearance at the inaugural Pwn2Own Automotive last January. </p>
<p>We have previously posted internal photos of the MaxiCharger in 2023 so the goal of this blog post is to present up to date internal photos of the main boards and provide additional information.</p>

		<p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, short-form video content reigns supreme. Platforms like Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts have become essential for creators, brands, and businesses to connect with their audiences. However, creating high-quality, engaging short-form videos can often be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Enter AI video tools — the game-changer that simplifies content creation while maintaining top-tier production quality.</p>
<p>With tools like the <strong>free AI video generator</strong>, creators can streamline the video creation process, allowing them to focus more on storytelling and strategy rather than the nitty-gritty of editing. These AI-powered platforms are not only accessible but also intuitive, making them ideal for seasoned creators and beginners alike.</p>
