<p>This article is a reflection on my experience as a finalist in the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2024. It’s a story of how a simple idea, born from a last-minute spark of inspiration, led to a meaningful project that resonated with the judges. I hope my journey inspires you to embrace your creativity, trust your instincts, and share your passions with the world.</p>

		<p>Windows is the most popular desktop operating system, but does that mean it&rsquo;s good for power users? Well, for the most part, yes.</p>
<p>Windows may be the most popular desktop operating system in the world, but it does have a reputation for sometimes being frustrating to use for one reason or another. And with Linux sometimes being brought up by people who are generally more tech-savvy, it begs the question of whether Windows is still a good OS for power users.</p>

<em>University of Warsaw</em></p>
<p>The Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw (MIM UW) invites applications for the positions of Assistant Professor in Computer Science, starting on 1st October 2025 or 1st February 2026.</p>
<p>MIM UW is one of the leading Computer Science faculties in Europe. It is known for talented students (e.g., two wins and multiple top tens in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest) and strong research teams, especially in algorithms, logic and automata, algorithmic economy, and computational biology. There is also a growing number of successful smaller groups in diverse areas including cryptography, databases and knowledge representation, distributed systems, and machine learning. Seven ERC grants in Computer Science are running at MIM UW at the moment.</p>

<p>Do they teach networking history classes yet? Or is it still too soon?</p>
<p>I was reading [Al]’s first installment of the Forgotten Internet series, on UUCP. The short summary is that it was a system for sending files across computers that were connected, intermittently, by point-to-point phone lines. Each computer knew the phone numbers of a few others, but none of them had anything like a global routing map, and IP addresses were still in the future. Still, it enabled file transfer and even limited remote access across the globe. And while some files contained computer programs, others files contained more human messages, which makes UUCP also a precursor to e-mail.</p>

<p>Around two years ago, the world was inundated with news about how generative AI or large language models would revolutionize the world. At the time it was easy to get caught up in the hype, but in the intervening months these tools have done little in the way of productive work outside of a few edge cases, and mostly serve to burn tons of cash while turning the Internet into even more of a desolate wasteland than it was before. They do this largely by regurgitating human creations like text, audio, and video into inferior simulacrums and, if you still want to exist on the Internet, there’s basically nothing you can do to prevent this sort of plagiarism. Except feed the AI models garbage data like this YouTuber has started doing.</p>
