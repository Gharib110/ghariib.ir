		<p>When a user creates a new account by signing up, the password they provide is not stored directly in the database. Instead, the password is passed through a hash function. This hash function converts the original password into a unique string (hash). The hash value is then stored in the server, not the actual password.</p>
<p>Later, when the user attempts to log in, they enter the same password. This entered password is passed through the same hash function, and the resulting hash is compared with the hash stored in the server. If both hash values match, it indicates that the password entered by the user is correct. This is because hash functions always generate the same output for the same input, ensuring consistency. If the hash values do not match, the login will be rejected.</p>

<p>The campaign is unique for its focus on the Chinese-speaking demographic and the use of software-related lures to activate the attack chain.</p>
<p>“Equally striking is the attackers’ sophisticated use of legitimate software as a delivery mechanism for malware, seamlessly blending malicious activities with seemingly benign applications,” Fishbein said.</p>
<p>“The adaptability of the PNGPlug loader further elevates the threat, as its modular design allows it to be tailored for multiple campaigns.”</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Post-Quantum Stealth Address Protocols</strong><br>
<em>Marija Mikić, Mihajlo Srbakoski, Strahinja Praška</em></p>
<p>The Stealth Address Protocol (SAP) allows users to receive assets through stealth addresses that are unlinkable to their stealth meta-addresses. The most widely used SAP, Dual-Key SAP (DKSAP), and the most performant SAP, Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual-Key SAP (ECPDKSAP), are based on elliptic curve cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks. These protocols depend on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which could be efficiently solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer using the Shor algorithm. In this paper three novel post-quantum SAPs based on lattice-based cryptography are presented: LWE SAP, Ring-LWE SAP and Module-LWE SAP. These protocols leverage Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to ensure quantum-resistant privacy. Among them, Module-LWE SAP, which is based on the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism, achieves the best performance and outperforms ECPDKSAP by approximately 66.8% in the scan time of the ephemeral public key registry.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Post-Quantum Threshold Ring Signature Applications from VOLE-in-the-Head</strong><br>
<em>James Hsin-Yu Chiang, Ivan Damgård, William R. Duro, Sunniva Engan, Sebastian Kolby, Peter Scholl</em></p>
<p>We propose efficient, post-quantum threshold ring signatures constructed from one-wayness of AES encryption and the VOLE-in-the-Head zero-knowledge proof system. Our scheme scales efficiently to large rings and extends the linkable ring signatures paradigm. We define and construct key-binding deterministic tags for signature linkability, that also enable succinct aggregation with approximate lower bound arguments of knowledge; this allows us to achieve succinct aggregation of our signatures without SNARKs. Finally, we extend our threshold ring signatures to realize post-quantum anonymous ledger transactions in the spirit of Monero. Our constructions assume symmetric key primitives only. Whilst it is common to build post-quantum signatures from the one-wayness property of AES and a post-quantum NIZK scheme, we extend this paradigm to define and construct novel security properties from AES that are useful for advanced signature applications. We introduce key-binding and pseudorandomness of AES to establish linkability and anonymity of our threshold ring signatures from deterministic tags, and similarly establish binding and hiding properties of block ciphers modeled as ideal permutations to build commitments from AES, a crucial building block for our proposed post-quantum anonymous ledger scheme.</p>
