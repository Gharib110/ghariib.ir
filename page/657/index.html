Mozilla’s overall revenue saw a sizeable boost in 2023, despite a drop in income from its lucrative search engine deals. According to its latest financial report, Mozilla’s revenue in 2023 hit <del>$653 million (US), up from <del>$593 million in 2022. The cause of the increase? Not any flashy new products, services, or deals – just ol’ fashioned interest and dividends (</del>$47 million) and returns on its investments (</del>$24 million). In fact, Mozilla’s income from search engine deals actually fell by ~$15 million in 2023.

		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user.
