<p>This week I&rsquo;m giving a little teaser as to what&rsquo;s coming with stealer logs in HIBP and in about 24 hours from the time of writing, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the whole thing in action. This has been a huge amount of work trawling through vast volumes of data and trying to make it usable by the masses, but I think what we&rsquo;re launchung tomorrow will be awesome. Along with a new feature around these stealer logs, we&rsquo;ve also added a huge number of new passwords to Pwned Passwords not previously seen before. Now, for the first time ever, &ldquo;fuckkangaroos&rdquo; will be flagged by any websites using the service ðŸ˜® More awesome examples coming in tomorrow&rsquo;s blog post, stay tuned!</p>

		<p>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and RHEL for edge provide very similar benefits and operational workflows, and also address similar use cases. Image mode is becoming the preferred deployment method in RHEL 10, so in this article we&rsquo;ll go over what this means for users of RHEL for edge.If youâ€™re following news about the upcoming RHEL 10 release (currently in beta) or about Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI), youâ€™ve heard about image mode for RHEL. And, if youâ€™re a user of RHEL for edge, which is also a part of Red Hat Device Edge, you&rsquo;ll have noticed that both start from</p>

<p>Modern NVMe SSDs require specialized approaches for forensic analysis. Each year, the speed and capacity of these devices grow, presenting significant challenges related to both the speed and reliability of transferring large volumes of data when capturing disk images. In this article, we will test the imaging of a high-speed Samsung 980Pro NVMe drive with OSForensics and FTK Imager. As a bonus, we also tested a prototype of our NVMe write-blocker, which yielded some intriguing results.</p>

<p>We recently shared an article about maximizing disk imaging speeds, which sparked a lot of feedback from our users and, surprisingly, from the developers of one of the disk imaging tools who quickly released an update addressing the issues we discovered in the initial test round. We did an additional test, and weâ€™re ready to share further insights into the performance of disk imaging.</p>
<h2 id="test-environment-and-measuring-methodology">Test Environment and Measuring Methodology</h2>
<p>The hardware setup for the new tests remained largely unchanged from the previous test. We used the same ASUS Vivobook S16 S5606MA laptop (Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 32GB RAM, Thunderbolt 4). However, this time, the storage device used was a powerful Samsung 860 PRO (512GB), which is miles ahead of the previously used test drive. Over 100GB of compressed data (a bunch of zip archives) was written to the drive for testing.</p>

<h2 id="the-unhealthy-obsession-with-measuring-developer-productivity">The unhealthy obsession with measuring developer productivity</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s an unhealthy obsession with companies looking for a way to measure developer productivity.</p>
<p>The desire to measure productivity is understandable; senior leaders have been under pressure to deliver results while capitalizing on their investments in teams and technology. There are no sinister intentions behind measuring developer productivity; leaders genuinely want their teams to be as productive as possible. The problem is that developer productivity is incredibly difficult to measure, resulting in organizations allocating disproportionate effort and resources while trying to find the magic measure.</p>

<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is projected to reachÂ $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Despite the growing sophistication of cyberattacks, human error remains one of the most common vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Phishing scams, malware attacks, and social engineering tactics oftenÂ target employeesÂ unaware of basic cyber security practices. This lack of awareness can result in breaches that cost companies millions.</p>

<p>Measuring success in human risk management is notoriously tricky. Unlike other areas of cybersecurity, where success is defined by stopping breaches or identifying vulnerabilities, metrics for Human Risk Programs often feels intangible. The absence of &ldquo;bad things happening&rdquo; doesnâ€™t always translate into clear, quantifiable success. Hereâ€™s why many programs struggle to show measurable impactâ€”and what can be done about it.</p>

		<p>In todayâ€™s cyber threat landscape, good enough is no longer good enough. Cyberattacks donâ€™t clock out at 5 PM, and neither can your security strategy. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), offering customers 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response isnâ€™t just a competitive advantageâ€”itâ€™s an essential service for business continuity, customer trust, and staying ahead of attackers.</p>
<p>But delivering round-the-clock security coverage is easier said than done. It requires the right tools, expertise, and scale. This is why partnering with OpenText for offering managed detection and response (MDR) can help MSPs deliver on this critical need without overburdening their resources.</p>
