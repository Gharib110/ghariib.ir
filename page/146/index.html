<p>A new malware campaign has compromised more than 5,000 WordPress sites to create admin accounts, install a malicious plugin, and steal data.</p>
<p>Researchers at webscript security company c/side discovered during an incident response engagement for one of their clients that the malicious activity uses the wp3[.]xyz domain to exfiltrate data but have yet to determine the initial infection vector.</p>
<p>After compromising a target, a malicious script loaded from the wp3[.]xyz domain creates the rogue admin account <em>wpx_admin</em> with credentials available in the code.</p>

	<div>
		<p>ESET researchers recently disclosed <strong>CVE-2024-7344</strong>, a critical vulnerability that compromises <strong>UEFI Secure Boot</strong>, a cornerstone of firmware-level security for modern systems. This flaw affects a wide range of UEFI-based systems and enables the execution of untrusted code during the boot process, thus bypassing Secure Boot protections. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can deploy persistent and stealthy threats like <strong>Bootkits</strong> (e.g., <strong>Bootkitty</strong> and <strong>BlackLotus</strong>) even on devices with Secure Boot enabled, irrespective of the operating system.</p>

		<p>CES 2025 was packed with announcements, but here&rsquo;s all you need to know about AMD and Nvidia.</p>
<p>If you somehow missed it, CES 2025 happened earlier this month and it was a blast for PC hardware announcements. AMD outed a bunch of new processors, as did Intel, and Nvidia announced the new GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards. We&rsquo;ve covered each announcement here at XDA, but if you&rsquo;d like an easily digestible roundup of what AMD and Nvidia announced, I&rsquo;ve got you covered with the heavy-hitting news right here.</p>

<p>In my previous blog, we ran through what NIS2 is and who it applies to. In this second part of the series, I’ll break down the main requirements you’ll find in NIS2 and help translate them into actionable and practical measures you can take to achieve NIS2 compliance. Join me in this post and start understanding what NIS2 is all about.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, you probably came to the conclusion that EU NIS2 is applicable to your company. Let’s dig into the requirements and what you need to do to become compliant.</p>

<p>If you love reading books and have yet to experience an e-reader, we highly recommend giving it a try. Not only are you able to carry thousands of books on a single device, but it&rsquo;s also better for the eyes when compared to a tablet or smartphone. Of course, there are lots of different options out there, but we recommend going with Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-13375<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 18, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 21 hours, 53 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Adifier System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user&rsquo;s identity prior to updating their details like password through the adifier_recover() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user&rsquo;s passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 9.8 | CRITICAL<br>

<p>Healthcare entities have a 51% probability of falling victim to phishing attacks. Successful incidents not only lead to control over systems, but can also expose patient health information, financial and insurance data. Healthcare providers are seeing an 81% uptick in threats, especially as cyber criminals weaponize increasingly advanced methods, and some organizations are struggling to keep pace. With over 265 clinic locations across the United States and a mission to deliver high-quality, accessible and compassionate care to under-served communities, Fast Pace Health recently found itself ill-equipped to fend off high volumes of relentless cyber threats. On account of overseeing large […]</p>

<p>“If you’re working with an organism like squid that can edit genetic information way better than any other organism, then it makes sense that that might be useful for a therapeutic application like deadening pain,” he said.</p>

<p>Researchers hope to mimic how squid and octopus use RNA editing in nerve channels that interpret pain and use that knowledge to manipulate human cells.</p>

<p>[Surya Chilukuri] writes in to share JTAGprobe — a fork of the official Raspberry Pi debugprobe firmware that lets you use the low-cost microcontroller development board for JTAG and SWD debugging just by flashing the provided firmware image.</p>
<p>We’ve seen similar projects in the past, but they’ve required some additional code running on the computer to bridge the gap between the Pico and your debugging software of choice. But [Surya] says this project works out of the box with common tools such as OpenOCD and pyOCD.</p>
