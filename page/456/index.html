		<p>Hosted control planes (HCP) is the name of the Red Hat product for the upstream HyperShift project. It allows you to deploy the control plane of a Red Hat OpenShift cluster into an OpenShift project instead of requiring dedicated (master) nodes and attach worker nodes managed via the nodePool API to it.</p>
<p>Hosted control planes architecture has several advantages when managing a fleet of clusters. It allows you to save infrastructure compute resources that would have been necessary for a standalone OpenShift topology and boosts the hosted OpenShift cluster provisioning time and day 2 automation (the provisioning time of a complete hosted cluster lasted 13 minutes in the lab used in this article, including the nodepools virtual machines (VMs) provisioning on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization).</p>

<p>Kubernetes SIG Network is delighted to announce the general availability of Gateway API v1.2! This version of the API was released on October 3, and we&rsquo;re delighted to report that we now have a number of conformant implementations of it for you to try out.</p>
<p>Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the <em>Standard channel</em> (Gateway API&rsquo;s GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features, and inaugurates our new release process — but it also brings two breaking changes that you&rsquo;ll want to be careful of.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As organizations increasingly use generative AI to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and gain a competitive edge in today’s fast-paced business environment, they seek mechanisms for measuring and monitoring their use of AI services.</p>
<p>To help you navigate the process of adopting generative AI technologies and proactively measure your generative AI implementation, AWS developed the AWS Audit Manager generative AI best practices framework. This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating and adopting generative AI technologies and addresses important aspects such as strategy alignment, governance, risk assessment, and security and operational best practices. You can use the framework within AWS Audit Manager as you implement generative AI workloads, to measure and monitor existing workloads through Audit Manager capabilities such as automated evidence collection and customized assessment reports.</p>

We’re seeing something of a terminal emulator renaissance of late, with developers eager to reimagine, rethink, and rewire the humble console to leverage modern hardware, GPU acceleration, containerised workflows, and (in some cases) AI/LLMs. Ghostty, a new open-source and cross-platform terminal application created by Mitchell Hashimoto (co-founder of HashiCorp) is the latest to join the fray. Hashimoto’s says he “set out to build a terminal emulator that was fast, feature-rich, and had a platform-native GUI while still being cross-platform.” The first public release materialised over Christmas, rather like a festive Dickensian spook seeking to give us a glimpse into the […]</p>

		<p>Elections define the course of democracies (even as there are several types of democracies), and 2024 was a landmark year, with over 60 countries — plus the European Union — holding national elections, impacting half the world’s population. As highlighted in Pew Research’s global elections report, this was a year of “political disruption,” where the Internet was a relevant stage for both democratic engagement and cyber threats.</p>
<p>At Cloudflare, with our presence in over 330 cities and 120 countries and interconnection with 12,500 networks, we’ve witnessed firsthand the digital impact of these elections. From monitoring Internet traffic patterns to mitigating cyberattacks, we’ve observed trends that reveal how elections increasingly play out online. As detailed in our just-published Cloudflare Impact report, we’ve also worked to protect media outlets, political campaigns, and help elections worldwide.</p>

Loupe (aka Image Viewer) is GNOME’s modern successor to the venerable Eye of GNOME has picked up its first batch of image editing features. The features in question were only recently merged upstream, aren’t finished, and not yet included in a stable build. But they’re an interesting addition that furthers the likelihood that Loupe could become the default image viewer on Ubuntu. At present, Ubuntu continues to use Eye of GNOME as the default tool for opening and browsing image files on desktop, despite Loupe having officially replaced it upstream in the GNOME project as a GNOME Core app. Loupe […]</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2024 — the Stop Grinch Bots Act of 2021 has not passed, and bots are more active and powerful than ever, leaving businesses to fend off increasingly sophisticated attacks on their own. During Black Friday 2024, Cloudflare observed:</p>
