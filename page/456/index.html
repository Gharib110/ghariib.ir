		<p>The risk of cyber attacks in the banking industry has reached unprecedented levels. Studies by the International Monetary Fund reveal that the financial sector is particularly vulnerable to cyber threats, with nearly one-fifth of reported incidents in the past two decades targeting this industry alone. As these threats continue to escalate, they drive the need for a regulatory response, prompting the banking and financial services industry to prepare for significant changes. GitLab enables financial institutions to proactively tackle these challenges, supporting banks on their regulatory journey while ensuring the operational resilience needed to protect the sensitive data pervasive throughout the banking ecosystem.</p>

		<p>Valve will finally count to three.</p>
<p>Have you heard the news? According to a renowned leaker, a new Half-Life project is currently undergoing friends and family testing over at Valve. People use the term &ldquo;Half-Life 3&rdquo; to refer to this game, but there&rsquo;s no absolute 100% guarantee that it&rsquo;s actually Half-Life 3. After all, we have the codename &ldquo;HLX&rdquo; but not a release title, so it might not be a third installment after all.</p>

		<p>How are you going to let a newcomer show you up on their second kick at the can?</p>
<p>For years now, the king of the graphics card castle has been obvious. NVIDIA is and continues to be the gold standard for graphics cards, and AMD‚Äôs Radeon cards could just never quite stack up. The bad news doesn‚Äôt end there; Intel‚Äôs recent launch of their B580 GPU makes matters much worse. In only their second launch, Intel has done what AMD hasn‚Äôt been able to do for generations: create a graphics card that will fly off the shelves. The B580, despite its continued teething issues, is out of stock basically everywhere and shows exactly how AMD can‚Äôt keep pointing the finger elsewhere for its poor management of the Radeon division.</p>

		<p>Like many other data brokers, Gravy is a company you may never have heard of, but it almost certainly knows a lot about you if you‚Äôre a US citizen.</p>
<p>Data brokers come in different shapes and sizes. What they have in common is that they gather personally identifiable data from various sources‚Äîfrom publicly available data to stolen datasets‚Äîand then sell the gathered data on. Gravy Analytics specializes in location intelligence, meaning it collects sensitive phone location and behavior data.</p>

		<p>Valve broke new ground with the Steam Deck that launched PC handhelds into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>When Valve launched the Steam Machines in 2015, it was hardly to any kind of acclaim. It was an interesting idea: creating a Linux-based PC to provide a console-like gaming experience. SteamOS was in its infancy here, and while the Steam Machines flopped, Valve wasn‚Äôt done with trying to bring their own platform to market.</p>
