		<p>Much like Adobe Flash, QuickTime from Apple is a bit of a relic some pretty serious, remote code execution type Windows QuickTime Vulnerabilities were recently discovered by Trend Micro. Apple has officially stated that they won’t be fixing them and the official line on this, is to uninstall QuickTime. I guess a lot of people […]</p>

		<p>Law enforcement agencies have identified Russian national Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov as a key member of the notorious Evil Corp cybercrime group and a LockBit ransomware affiliate.</p>
<p>Ryzhenkov, also known by his alias “Beverley,” has been linked to over 60 LockBit ransomware builds and is believed to have sought to extort at least $100 million from victims in ransom demands.</p>
<p>According to Authorities, Ryzhenkov was unmasked through data obtained during Operation Cronos, a joint investigation with international partners.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This article will show you how to automatically issue certificates using Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (IdM) and cert-manager operator for OpenShift.</p>
<p>Securing communications is a must, not only to protect the data but to provide greater data integrity as well. Applications achieve greater communications security using cryptographic certificates, but these certificates have their own lifecycle. They need to be renewed when expired and the renewal process, when done manually, is prone to errors.</p>

		<p>IntroductionIn a previous article, I demonstrated how to configure the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) feature included in the Identity Management (IdM) Dogtag Certificate Authority (CA). Specifically, I covered installation of IdM with random serial numbers, and how to enable the ACME service and expired certificate pruning. This article explains the management of ACME (currently a technology preview) with IdM and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.Currently, mod_md is the only ACME client implementation completely supported and provided by Red Hat. For this article,</p>

		<p>We continue to expand the scope of our assurance programs at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and are pleased to announce the successful completion of our first ever Protected B High Value Assets (PBHVA) assessment with 149 assessed services and features. Completion of this assessment effective October 4, 2024, makes AWS the first cloud service provider (CSP) in Canada to meet this high security bar and provide assurance to our valued customers. This assessment also re-affirms our commitment to helping public and commercial customers achieve and maintain the highest-grade security standard for workloads with increased sensitivity.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/aws-kms-how-many-keys-do-i-need/">AWS KMS: How many keys do I need?</a></h1>
	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As organizations continue their cloud journeys, effective data security in the cloud is a top priority. Whether it’s protecting customer information, intellectual property, or compliance-mandated data, encryption serves as a fundamental security control. This is where AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) steps in, offering a robust foundation for encryption key management on AWS.</p>
<p>One of the first questions that often arises for customers is, “How many keys do I actually need?” This seemingly simple question requires careful consideration of various factors. Although AWS KMS makes encryption straightforward, organizations need to consider several aspects of their key management strategy. These include choosing between AWS managed keys, customer managed keys, and importing your own keys (BYOK), as well as deciding between centralized and decentralized key management approaches. Each option has its own benefits and trade-offs in terms of security, control, and operational overhead. By understanding these choices and how they align with your organization’s needs, you can develop an effective and efficient key management strategy.</p>

	<div>
		<p>AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that provides a convenient way to deploy essential network protections for your virtual private clouds (VPCs). In this blog post, we discuss Geographic IP Filtering, a new feature of Network Firewall that you can use to filter traffic based on geographic location and meet compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Customers with internet-facing applications are constantly in need of advanced security features to protect their applications from threat actors. This includes restricting traffic to and from their workloads in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to certain geographies because of security risk. Customers operating in highly regulated industries—such as banking, public sector, or insurance—might have specific security requirements that can be addressed by Geographic IP Filtering.</p>
