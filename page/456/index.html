		<p>Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users&rsquo; needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflare’s observations and a review of the year’s DNS trends.</p>

		<p>In 2024, Thanksgiving (November 28), Black Friday (November 29), and Cyber Monday (December 2) significantly impacted Internet traffic, similar to trends seen in 2023 and previous years. This year, Thanksgiving in the US drove a 20% drop in daily traffic compared to the previous week, with a notable 33% dip at 15:45 ET. In contrast, Black Friday and Cyber Monday drove traffic spikes. But how global is this trend, and do attacks increase during Cyber Week?</p>

	<div>
		<p>Modern application development has evolved dramatically. Gone are the days when a couple of developers, a few machines, and some pizza were enough to launch an app. As the industry grew, DevOps revolutionized collaboration, and Docker popularized containerization, simplifying workflows and accelerating delivery. </p>
<p>Later, DevSecOps brought security into the mix. Fast forward to today, and the demand for software has never been greater, with more than 750 million cloud-native apps expected by 2025.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hosted control planes (HCP) is the name of the Red Hat product for the upstream HyperShift project. It allows you to deploy the control plane of a Red Hat OpenShift cluster into an OpenShift project instead of requiring dedicated (master) nodes and attach worker nodes managed via the nodePool API to it.</p>
<p>Hosted control planes architecture has several advantages when managing a fleet of clusters. It allows you to save infrastructure compute resources that would have been necessary for a standalone OpenShift topology and boosts the hosted OpenShift cluster provisioning time and day 2 automation (the provisioning time of a complete hosted cluster lasted 13 minutes in the lab used in this article, including the nodepools virtual machines (VMs) provisioning on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization).</p>

<p>Kubernetes SIG Network is delighted to announce the general availability of Gateway API v1.2! This version of the API was released on October 3, and we&rsquo;re delighted to report that we now have a number of conformant implementations of it for you to try out.</p>
<p>Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the <em>Standard channel</em> (Gateway API&rsquo;s GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features, and inaugurates our new release process — but it also brings two breaking changes that you&rsquo;ll want to be careful of.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As organizations increasingly use generative AI to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and gain a competitive edge in today’s fast-paced business environment, they seek mechanisms for measuring and monitoring their use of AI services.</p>
<p>To help you navigate the process of adopting generative AI technologies and proactively measure your generative AI implementation, AWS developed the AWS Audit Manager generative AI best practices framework. This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating and adopting generative AI technologies and addresses important aspects such as strategy alignment, governance, risk assessment, and security and operational best practices. You can use the framework within AWS Audit Manager as you implement generative AI workloads, to measure and monitor existing workloads through Audit Manager capabilities such as automated evidence collection and customized assessment reports.</p>

We’re seeing something of a terminal emulator renaissance of late, with developers eager to reimagine, rethink, and rewire the humble console to leverage modern hardware, GPU acceleration, containerised workflows, and (in some cases) AI/LLMs. Ghostty, a new open-source and cross-platform terminal application created by Mitchell Hashimoto (co-founder of HashiCorp) is the latest to join the fray. Hashimoto’s says he “set out to build a terminal emulator that was fast, feature-rich, and had a platform-native GUI while still being cross-platform.” The first public release materialised over Christmas, rather like a festive Dickensian spook seeking to give us a glimpse into the […]</p>

		<p>Elections define the course of democracies (even as there are several types of democracies), and 2024 was a landmark year, with over 60 countries — plus the European Union — holding national elections, impacting half the world’s population. As highlighted in Pew Research’s global elections report, this was a year of “political disruption,” where the Internet was a relevant stage for both democratic engagement and cyber threats.</p>
<p>At Cloudflare, with our presence in over 330 cities and 120 countries and interconnection with 12,500 networks, we’ve witnessed firsthand the digital impact of these elections. From monitoring Internet traffic patterns to mitigating cyberattacks, we’ve observed trends that reveal how elections increasingly play out online. As detailed in our just-published Cloudflare Impact report, we’ve also worked to protect media outlets, political campaigns, and help elections worldwide.</p>
