<p>For many of us, when we think of creating a custom enclosure, our minds immediately go towards our 3D printer. A bit of time in your CAD program of choice, and in an hour (or several), you’ve got a bespoke plastic box. A hacker’s dream come true.</p>
<p>But extruded plastic is hardly perfect. For one thing, you might want a finished piece that looks a little more attractive on your desk. Which is why we appreciate this quick hack from [Tilma]. When faced with a broken LED light and minimal equipment, he decided to transplant the repaired electronics into a scratch-built wooden frame that not only looks better than the original, but is more functional.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It seems this year bug bounties are getting really serious, especially on the secondary market involving exploit trading firms, not direct to the software producer or owner. $500,000 isn’t chump change and would be a good year for a small security team, especially living somewhere with a weaker currency. Even for a solo security researcher […]</p>

		<p>One of the most critical gaps in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they rely on static knowledge already contained within them. Basically, they might be very good at understanding and responding to prompts, but they often fall short in providing current or highly specific information. This is where Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) comes in;  RAG addresses these critical gaps in traditional LLMs by incorporating current and new information that serves as a reliable source of truth for these models. </p>

		<p>Within software development, security and compliance are more than simple boxes to check. Each attestation and compliance check is backed by a well-considered risk assessment that aims to avoid ever-changing vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Software development teams don’t want to worry about vulnerabilities when they are focused on building something remarkable.</p>
<p>In this article, we explain how Docker Hub and Docker Scout can help development teams ensure a more secure and compliant software supply chain. </p>
