<p>Expensify unveiled a new &lsquo;feature&rsquo; where random people would help train their AI to better analyze receipts. Problem is that the random people could see medical receipts, hotel bills, and other PII. We discuss how they allowed this and the press surrounding it. We also discuss why these kinds of issues are prime reasons to do periodic vendor reviews.</p>

<p>I wanted to talk about something that I&rsquo;ve started doing at work&hellip; Creating training&hellip; custom training that can help your org get around the old style training.</p>
<p>Also, we got some community audio from one of our listeners! &ldquo;JB&rdquo; went to a SANS event in Berlin, Germany a few weeks ago, and talked to some attendees, as well as Heather Mahalick (@HeatherMahalik), instructor of the FOR585 FOR585: Advanced Smartphone Forensics&quot;</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Michael De Libero spends his work hours running an application security team at a gaming development company. I (Bryan) was really impressed at the last NCC Group Quarterly meetup when he gave a talk (not recorded) about how to properly build out your Application Security Team.</p>
<p>So I asked him on, and we went over the highlights of his talk. Some of the topics included:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We started off the show talking to Mr. Boettcher about what DDE is and how malware is using this super legacy Windows component (found in Windows 2) to propogate malware in MS Office docs and spreadsheets. We also talk about how to protect your Windows users from this.</p>
<p>We then get into discussing why it&rsquo;s so important to have proper asset management in place. Without knowing what is in your environment, you could suffer gaps in coverage of your anti-virus/EDR software, unable to patch systems properly and even make it easier for lateral movement.</p>

<p>Adam Shostack has been a fixture of threat modeling for nearly 2 decades. He wrote the &rsquo;threat modeling&rsquo; bible that many people consult when they need to do threat modeling properly.</p>
<p>We discuss the different threat modeling types (STRIDE, DREAD, Trike, PASTA) and which ones Adam enjoys using.</p>

<p>Upon loading the screen, we are presented with a file upload and a button to make a jpeg icon. We also note that the version string indicates it was made in 2016, with a version of <code>Version 2016.3717</code>. After playing around with it for a little while, I thought about how there was that ImageMagick bug last year that let you execute code remotely. I wasn’t sure it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>
