<p>Oracle announced new Virtualbox 7.1.6 release this Tuesday with various bug-fixes, performance improvements, and minor new features.</p>
<p>VirtualBox had heavy screen tearing and flickering issue in Linux VMs running with recent Kernel and Wayland for a period of time, that’s why I switched to QEMU/KVM.</p>
<p>Since the last 7.1.4, VirtualBox greatly improved the flickering, black screen and other screen update issues. In the new release, it also fixed issue with Linux guest screen flickering when guest was using VMSVGA graphics adapter.</p>

A fresh stable release of Wine — the open-source compatibility layer that makes it possible to run Windows apps and games on Linux and macOS — has been uncorked. More than 6,000 thousand changes were distilled in Wine 10.0, changes collected, collated, and curated over the past 12 months of Wine 9.x development releases. For those who’ve supped the dev cycle builds, the bulk of what’s new in Wine 10.0 will be familiar. Wine is not the ‘everyday essential’ it was in years past. Back then, web-based services weren’t as capable, so folks were wedded to specific pieces of Windows software, […]</p>

<p>As we step into 2025, the cyber security landscape continues to be as complex as ever for security leaders looking to protect their organizations from increasingly injurious cyber threats. The World Economic Forum (WEF) detailed some of the most challenging threats in its Global Cyber security Outlook 2025, with some critical areas of concern mirroring those in our own State of Cyber security Report 2025. Both reports emphasize the growing sophistication of cyber threats, the integration of emerging technologies to make cyber threats harder to detect and deter, and the outsized influence of global geopolitical factors influencing cyber security threats.
