		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-24786<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 6, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 50 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> WhoDB is an open source database management tool. While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled). If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 10.0 | CRITICAL<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-24787<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 6, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 50 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings, which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user, in many cases, to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true`, the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case, the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&amp;allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one), the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-24981<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 6, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 50 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. In affected versions unsafe parsing logic of the URL from markdown can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code due to a bypass to the existing guards around the `javascript:` protocol scheme in the URL. The parsing logic implement in `props.ts` maintains a deny-list approach to filtering potential malicious payload. It does so by matching protocol schemes like `javascript:` and others. These security guards can be bypassed by an adversarial that provides JavaScript URLs with HTML entities encoded via hex string. Users who consume this library and perform markdown parsing from unvalidated sources could result in rendering vulnerable XSS anchor links. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.13.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>

		<p>A change may be coming in the way you&rsquo;ll be paying for Apple Care. Apple doesn&rsquo;t approve of an app that it has approved—semantics are at the heart of a porn app problem. DeepSeek is this past week&rsquo;s big artificial intelligence story. What&rsquo;s different about this new AI contender? Does it secure your data? And Apple&rsquo;s new Invites app doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too inviting.</p>

		<p>The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA, or CRA for short) is coming. I’ve talked about this piece of upcoming regulation in some depth before, having covered its background and stipulations in previous pieces on our website and for the Forbes Technology Council, and explored what it means for the businesses who consume open source in later articles (you can also read a version of this blog on Forbes). However, with the clock ticking and time running out to make your devices and software compliant with the Act’s new cybersecurity requirements, I thought I’d talk about how you should be approaching your device design and cybersecurity foundation. In this blog, I’ll run through a blueprint for cybersecurity, and outline what you should be doing to meet EU CRA compliance if you’re an IoT or device manufacturer. </p>
