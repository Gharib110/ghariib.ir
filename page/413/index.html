		<p>Inspirado neste post, resolvi também escrever um texto do caminho que fiz para conseguir a certificação em Vue.</p>
<p>Trabalho com Vue há 3 anos, e no momento estamos fazendo a transição da aplicação de Vue2 para Vue3, então estudar para a certificação me pareceu um bom caminho para atualizar os conhecimentos no framework.</p>
<p>Se você está começando no mundo do desenvolvimento web, não recomendo que faça a certificação, pois a mesma está custando atualmente quase R$600,00 e e acredito que você consegue extrair mais valor fazendo cursos e outras atividades com este dinheiro. Mas se você já é um profissional experiente e quer colocar seus conhecimentos a prova, exibir o badge de dev Vue e ajudar o desenvolvimento do framework (parte do dinheiro vai para a equipe do Vue), recomendo que o faça.</p>

<p>After a bit too much eggnog, Elliot Williams and Al Williams got together to see what Hackaday had been up to over the holiday. Turns out, quite a bit. There was a lot to cover, but the big surprise was the “What’s that Sound” competition. Do you know who had the correct answer from the last show? No one! So they guys did the right thing and drew from all the entrants for a coveted Hackaday Podcast T-shirt.</p>

	<div>
		<p>What hardware is needed for security information and event management (SIEM) systems?</p>
<p>At some point, the information security department of any large company inevitably begins to consider introducing a SIEM system — or replacing the existing one, and must therefore estimate the budget required for its deployment. But SIEM isn’t a lightweight product that can be deployed within existing infrastructure. Almost all solutions in this category require additional hardware, meaning that equipment must be purchased or rented.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p><em>This post was originally published on Automation.com.</em></p>
<p>As organizations around the globe rapidly adopt AI, it is becoming clear that this transformation brings both significant opportunities and serious risks. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65% of participants said their companies regularly used AI, a dramatic increase in a very short period. This growing reliance on AI is transforming industries, especially in operational technology (OT) sectors like manufacturing and energy, where AI is a critical driver for efficiency and automation. However, it is also becoming a powerful tool for cybercriminals, raising the stakes for OT security.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Infostealer capabilities and how to protect your organization against this threat.</p>
<p>Although malicious programs that hunt for passwords, financial, and other sensitive data have been around for over 20 years, the word “infostealer” was coined only in the early 2010s. Recently, however, this relatively simple type of malware has been popping up in unexpected role — deployed as a springboard for major targeted hacks and cyberattacks. For example, the theft of the data of 500 million Ticketmaster customers and a ransomware attack on the Brazilian Ministry of Health were both traced to infostealers. The main challenge posed by infostealers is that they can’t be defeated solely at the infrastructure level and within a company’s perimeter. The non-work activities and personal devices of employees also need to be considered.</p>

<p>While you can’t delete your personal info from the internet entirely, you can take strong steps to remove it from risky places. Several where others could tap into it for profit or harm. </p>
<p>Why is it so important to take control of our personal info? It has street value, and it has for some time now. Because so much of business, finance, healthcare, and life in general runs on it, your personal info has a dollar sign to it. Plenty of people want to get a hold of it. </p>
