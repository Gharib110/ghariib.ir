<p>There are many AI models out there that you can play with from companies like OpenAI, Google, and a host of others. But when you use them, you get the experience they want, and you run it on their computer. There are a variety of reasons you might not like this. You may not want your data or ideas sent through someone else’s computer. Maybe you want to tune and tweak in ways they aren’t going to let you.</p>

		<p>S Ventures invests in poolside, one of the most watched and highest valued startups in generative AI for software engineering today.</p>
<p>In October 2024, SentinelOne’s venture arm, S Ventures, made a strategic investment in poolside as part of the AI assistive coding startup’s $500 million Series B round. It was one of S Ventures notable recent investments in generative AI (GenAI) start-ups following similar investments in leading foundational and enterprise LLM platforms such as Anthropic and Cohere, as well as Scale, a startup focused on the development and tooling layer of AI, and Galileo, a leading evaluation intelligence platform for AI teams.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Automatic sandbox services should not be treated like &ldquo;antivirus scanners&rdquo; to determine maliciousness for samples. That’s not their intended use, and they perform poorly in that role. Unfortunately, providing an &ldquo;overall score&rdquo; or &ldquo;verdict&rdquo; is misleading.</p>

		<p>You won&rsquo;t find a better price for this drive</p>
<p>Portable SSDs are generally a great investment if you&rsquo;re looking to store your data externally and need lightning-quick access. The only catch is that they usually don&rsquo;t offer tons of storage space, limited to around 8TB if you&rsquo;re looking at consumer-facing products. For most, that&rsquo;s going to be enough, but if you need much more, and are looking to really back everything up, then this Seagate 20TB external HDD is going to be the perfect solution.</p>

		<p>Learn how several misconfigurations and user-defined code issues in AWS Lambda could lead to potential credential theft and lateral movement.</p>
<p>As serverless computing continues to revolutionize the cloud landscape, AWS Lambda has emerged as a pivotal service, offering a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model that allows developers to focus solely on code while AWS manages the underlying infrastructure. This shift towards serverless architectures brings new security challenges and considerations that security researchers and professionals must understand and address.</p>
