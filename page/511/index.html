<p>Here at Mandiant FLARE, malware reverse engineering is a regular part of our day jobs. At times we are required to perform basic triages on binaries, where every hour saved is critical to incident response timelines. At other times we examine complicated samples for days developing comprehensive analysis reports. As we face larger and more complex malware, often written in modern languages like Rust, knowing where to go, what to look at, and developing a &ldquo;map&rdquo; of the malware forms a significant effort that directly impacts our response times and triage effectiveness.</p>

<p>AWS is aware of CVE-2022-1471 in SnakeYaml software, included in DynamoDB local jar and Docker distributions from version 1.21 and version 2.0. If leveraged, this issue could allow an actor to perform remote code execution using the SnakeYaml&rsquo;s Constructor(), as the software does not restrict the types that can be instantiated during deserialization. AWS has found no evidence that this issue has been leveraged, however, customers should still take action. On November 6, 2024, we released a fix for this issue. Customers should <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html">upgrade DynamoDB local</a> to the latest version: v1.25.1 and above, or 2.5.3 and above.</p>
