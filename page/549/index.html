<p>It’s been about two weeks since we announced <a href="/blog/encrypt-your-face/">an initiative</a> to distribute versatile face coverings to help support everyone who is self-organizing for change in the streets. Since then, we’ve shipped over $25,000 worth of face coverings to organizers throughout the United States. Over $6,000 worth of merchandise was sent to Washington D.C. last week in time for the Juneteenth events in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>The world was a different place when we <a href="https://signal.org/blog/reactions/">announced message reactions</a> back in February, but expressing the way you feel has never been more important. Instead of being limited to the default set of reactions that we started with, the latest Signal updates for Android, Desktop, and iOS let you react with even more emoji.</p>

<p>Signal iOS now includes a new feature that makes it possible to switch to a brand-new iPhone or iPad while securely transferring Signal information from your existing iOS device. As with every new Signal feature, the process is end-to-end encrypted and <a href="/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/">designed to protect your privacy</a>. Transfers also occur over a local connection (similar to AirDrop), so even large migrations can be completed quickly.</p>

<p>In the midst of world-wide protests against racism and police brutality, a lot of people are becoming more immediately aware and concerned about the security of their data and online communication. We’ve gotten a lot of questions at Signal over the past week, so we wanted to briefly recap how it is that we’ve designed Signal, and how we think about concepts like privacy, security, and trust.</p>

<p>Right now, people around the world are marching and protesting against racism and police brutality, outraged by the most recent police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At Signal, we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we don’t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out.</p>
