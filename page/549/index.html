<p>At the Open Whisper Systems <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/">spring break of code</a> in 2013, I started work on <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS">TextSecure iOS</a>. People are chomping at the bit to use our software on iOS. After a hiatus from the project, I’ve been happy to return to it over the last few months, joining some other contributors, including <a href="https://www.fredericjacobs.com/">Frederic Jacobs</a> as co-lead, <a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3">Alban Diquet</a>, and <a href="http://www.cvursache.com/">Claudiu-Vlad Ursache</a> submitting pull requests, even over the holidays, with important cryptographic storage and UI-polishing contributions, and Bitcoin donations coming in from around the world.</p>

<p>We are at the halfway point of Winter Break of Code. We have two homes near the beach shared by 12 people. 10 of us are working on the apps &amp; website and 2 are leading up delicious dinner efforts. We’ve spent time on the beach, in the ocean, in the mountains, and of course working. Concepts for future startups and tactics about self-publishing books are brewing, and conversations are lined with politics and activism. Work sessions are focused on making cryptography usable in existing Android apps and soon-to-be-released iPhone apps.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since our last minor release which makes 1.0.6 a more significant update than usual. With a new 3.12 kernel, <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/emergency-self-destruction-luks-kali/">a LUKS nuke feature</a>, new <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Kali ARM build scripts</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-cloud">Kali AMAZON AMI and Google Compute image generation scripts</a>, not to mention numerous tool additions and updates - this release is really heavily laden with goodness. For more information about what’s new in this release, check the <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">Kali changelog</a>.</p>

<p>By all rights, I should not be here. My application was last-minute to say the least, and little more than a casual note that I’d be down to reprise my role from SBoC as web hacker for whispersystems.org. Maybe it was because of my work in the previous months on tweaking the site layout to be responsive, or because <a href="https://www.twitter.com/bcrypt">@bcrypt</a> (who is infinitely more qualified) was too dedicated to her work at the EFF to take the time off, or because my birthday happened to fall on this week, but for one reason or another, the universe smiled, and here I am.</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog/winter-break-of-code">Winter Break of Code</a>, being closely linked by name to the season of Winter, began with a calm trickle of ex{hausted,cited} people carrying laptops and cell phone collections after a parade of delays and weather issues. Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening. It was very welcome.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.offsec.com/cyberversity/penetration-testing/">penetration testers</a>, we often need to travel with sensitive data stored on our laptops. Of course, we use full disk encryption wherever possible, including our Kali Linux machines, which tend to contain the most sensitive materials.</p>
<p>Setting up <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/">full disk encryption with Kali</a> is a simple process. The Kali installer includes a straightforward process for setting up encrypted partitions with LVM and LUKS. Once encrypted, the Kali operating system requires a password at boot time to allow the OS to boot and decrypt your drive, thus protecting this data in case your laptop is stolen. Managing decryption keys and partitions is done using the cryptsetup utility.</p>

<p>The trouble is that while building a social network is hard, most interesting software today is acutely “social.” Even privacy-enhancing technology, which seems anathema to the aesthetic of social networking, is tremendously social. For people to effectively use private communication software like TextSecure, they need to be able to know how to contact their friends using TextSecure.</p>

<p>The fundamental contradiction is that while donations are meant for a <em>project</em>, they’re traditionally sent to a <em>person</em>. Even if a project sets up a bank account, there are still only a few people who have access to the money itself, and distributing it appropriately can be hard to figure out.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we’ve been working with <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod</a> over the past few months. CyanogenMod is an open source aftermarket Android firmware distribution with <a href="http://stats.cyanogenmod.com/">ten million users</a> and ~20k installs a day. Their rapid growth is beginning to rival Microsoft for the third-largest smartphone OS distribution.</p>
<p>As of today, the TextSecure protocol will begin shipping as part of the CyanogenMod OS-level SMS provider, in an effort to provide completely transparent end-to-end text message encryption between all of their users.</p>
