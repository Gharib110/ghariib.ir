<blockquote>
<p>Here are 67k binaries, well more accurately 67,139 binaries. Solve every single one, append the results together in order (shouldn’t be too difficult as the binaries are numbered) and then from there I’m sure you can figure it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are probably a hundred ways to solve this challenge, but I decided to give it a go using radare2’s <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2-r2pipe">r2pipe</a>.</p>

<p>This week, we discuss the details of the leak (as of 11Mar 2017), and how damaging it is to blue teamers.</p>
<p>To help us, we asked Mr. Dave Kennedy  (@hackingDave) to sit down with us and discuss what he found, and his opinions of the data that was leaked. Mr. Kennedy is always a great interview, and his insights are now regularly seen on Fox Business News, CNN, and MSNBC.</p>

<p>We have 3 interviews here this week:</p>
<p>Justin Case (@jcase) discusses some of his talk about hacking the Google Pixel, an HTC produced phone. We discuss why Android gets the &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; moniker by the media, and whether it&rsquo;s warranted or not.</p>
<p>Next, Sam Vaughn (@sidechannel_org) talks about setting up the Crypto Village, why he does it, and what you can learn by solving these puzzles.</p>

<p>Most of this focus has been on Google Apps for Business, but generally speaking, we&rsquo;ve been thinking about many different challenges that are posed by large enterprises adopting cloud solutions. Often these services lack; functionality required at the enterprise level (sometimes something basic such as logging of a particular event), inter-operability with other cloud services (leading to the rise of CASB tools), and a reactive API driven approach to security and monitoring. Although many CASB solutions offer API driven monitoring of a great variety of services, this is by it&rsquo;s nature a reactive or detective approach.</p>

<p>Joel also co-authored many of the &ldquo;Hacking Exposed&rdquo; series of books. We ask him about other books that could come from the well known series.</p>
<p>We also ask about why the #infosec person often feels like they need to protect their organization to the expense of our own position (or sanity) and how we as an industry should be not &lsquo;in front of the train&rsquo;, but guiding the train to it&rsquo;s destination, one of prosperity and security. Conversely, we also discuss why some positions in security are so short-lived, such as the role of CISO.</p>

<p>But this week, we have a different Mr. Douglas.  This week, he&rsquo;s here to talk about sales tactics, #neuro #linguistic #programming, leading the question, and other social engineering techniques that salespeople will do to get you to buy maybe what your company doesn&rsquo;t need, but thinks it does. We have some good times discussing ways to ensure the buying of your new shiny box at work goes more smoothly, what you should look out for, and ways to tell if they are over-selling and under-delivering.</p>

<p>We discuss sandboxes and sandboxing technology, jails, chrooting of applications, and even tools that keep applications honest, in particular, the pledge(2) function in OpenBSD</p>
