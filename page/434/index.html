		<p>We released a new open source byte-pair tokenizer that is faster and more flexible than popular alternatives.</p>
<p>The post So many tokens, so little time: Introducing a faster, more flexible byte-pair tokenizer appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs), such as those used by GitHub Copilot, do not operate directly on bytes but on <em>tokens</em>, which can complicate scaling. In this post, we explain how we solved that challenge at GitHub to support the growing number of Copilot users and features since the first launching Copilot two years ago.</p>

<p>The McAfee mobile research team recently identified a significant global increase of SpyLoan, also known as predatory loan apps, on Android. These PUP (potentially unwanted programs) applications use social engineering tactics to trick users into providing sensitive information and granting extra mobile app permissions,  which can lead to extortion, harassment, and financial loss. </p>
<p>During our investigation of this threat, we identified fifteen apps with a combined total of over eight million installations.  This group of loan apps share a common framework to encrypt and exfiltrate data from a victim’s device to a command and control (C2) server using a similar HTTP endpoint infrastructure. They operate localized in targeted territories, mainly in South America, Southern Asia, and Africa, with some of them being promoted through deceptive advertising on social media.  </p>

<p>As smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives, malicious apps have grown increasingly deceptive and sophisticated. Recently, we uncovered a seemingly harmless app called “BMI CalculationVsn” on the Amazon App Store, which is secretly stealing the package name of installed apps and incoming SMS messages under the guise of a simple health tool. McAfee reported the discovered app to Amazon, which took prompt action, and the app is no longer available on Amazon Appstore.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>An unfamiliar type of scam has surged against everyday people, with a year-over-year increase of some 400%, putting job seekers at risk of losing their time and money.</p>
<p>The emerging threat is delivered in “task scams” or “gamified job scams.” While these scams were virtually non-existent in 2020, the FTC reported 5,000 cases in 2023 and a whopping 20,000 cases in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>In these scams, online criminals prey on people looking for remote jobs by offering them simple repetitive tasks such as liking videos, optimizing apps, boosting product interest, or rating product images. These tasks are usually organized in sets of 40 tasks that will take the victim to a “next level” once they are completed.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The move to AI and cloud native is accelerating amongst network equipment and IT vendors which have announced highly integrated smart cloud solutions designed to migrate their <strong>telco customers</strong> into a new and profitable cloud future.  The <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),</strong> as the name suggests, is a vendor-neutral consortium dedicated to making <strong>cloud native</strong> ubiquitous. The group defines cloud native as a collection of “technologies [that] empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.”</p>

	<div>
		<p>The adoption of cloud-native methodologies, processes and tools has been a challenge for communications service providers (CSPs), aka telcos or network operators.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telcos are embracing cloud-native processes and tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>It’s part of their evolution towards being digital service providers</strong></li>
<li><strong>But the cloud-native journey is still in its early stages</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real cultural change is needed if telcos are to capitalise fully on the cloud-native opportunities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside a a session, Why cloud native is essential to delivering the automation, agility and innovation needed to support new services, at Telco TV’s DSP Leaders World Forum event in Windsor, UK, a poll was taken.  The following question was asked, <strong>“How can Digital Service Providers maximize the cloud-native opportunities?”</strong>  Respondents were able to select all the options they deemed relevant.  Here are the results:</p>

		<p>Methods to recover access to a hacked Telegram account</p>
<p>Account hijacking in Telegram has become a serious criminal business in today’s world. Scammers employ sophisticated methods to steal access to accounts, and then use them to attack other users through deepfakes, social engineering, and other techniques. Here’s how it typically works: having stolen an account, scammers send phishing messages to all its contacts — such as <em>“Hi, I urgently need money. Can you help me?”</em>, <em>Please vote for me if you have a moment</em> or <em>You’ve received a gift – a one-year subscription to Telegram Premium</em> — to hijack even more accounts.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>With generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) on the frontlines of information security, red teams play an essential role in identifying vulnerabilities that others can overlook.</p>
<p>With the average cost of a data breach reaching an all-time high of $4.88 million in 2024, businesses need to know exactly where their vulnerabilities lie. Given the remarkable pace at which they’re adopting gen AI, there’s a good chance that some of those vulnerabilities lie in AI models themselves — or the data used to train them.</p>

<p>DEF CON 32 has wound down, and we want to thank our community for making this one stellar. You never fail to bring gigantic love and enthusiasm to every aspect of the Con, and we are inspired by your example.</p>
<p>The curveball of a sudden, late-stage venue scramble could have spelled disaster, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Having so much of the Con back under one roof felt great! FIrst years in a new venue always mean some hiccups and learning experiences, but you reacted with patience and grace when they happened. For this you have our eternal gratitude.</p>
