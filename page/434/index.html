<p>In Q3 2024, McAfee Labs identified a sharp rise in the Remcos RAT threat. It has emerged as a significant threat in the world of cybersecurity, gaining traction with its ability to infiltrate systems and compromise sensitive data. This malware, often delivered through phishing emails and malicious attachments, allows cybercriminals to remotely control infected machines, making it a powerful tool for espionage, data theft, and system manipulation. As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, understanding the mechanisms behind RemcosRAT and adopting effective security measures are crucial to protecting your systems from this growing threat. This blog presents a technical analysis of two RemcosRAT variants</p>

<p>The art of writing has become a cluttered one to follow, typically these days through a graphical word processor. There may be a virtual page in front of you, but it’s encumbered by much UI annoyance. To combat this a variety of distraction free software and appliances have been created over the years.</p>
<p>But it’s perhaps [Liam Proven]’s one we like the most — it’s a bootable 16-bit DOS environment with a selection of simple text and office packages on board. No worries about being distracted by social media when you don’t even have networking.</p>

<p>McAfee threat researchers have identified several consumer brands and product categories most frequently used by cybercriminals to trick consumers into clicking on malicious links in the first weeks of this holiday shopping season. As holiday excitement peaks and shoppers hunt for the perfect gifts and amazing deals, scammers are taking advantage of the buzz. The National Retail Federation projects holiday spending will reach between $979.5 and $989 billion this year, and cybercriminals are capitalizing by creating scams that mimic the trusted brands and categories consumers trust. From October 1 to November 12, 2024, McAfee safeguarded its customers from 624,346 malicious or suspicious URLs tied to popular consumer brand names – a clear indication that bad actors are exploiting trusted brand names to deceive holiday shoppers. </p>

<p>Claroty’s TEAM82 has a report on a new malware strain, what they’re calling IOCONTROL. It’s a Linux malware strain aimed squarely at embedded devices. One of the first targets of this malware, surprisingly, is the Iraeli made Orpak gas station pumps. There’s a bit of history here, as IOCONTROL is believed to be used by CyberAv3ngers, a threat actor aligned with Iran. In 2023 a group aligned with Israel claimed to have compromised the majority of the gas stations in Iran. IOCONTROL seems to have been deployed as retribution.</p>

<p>To keep up with the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, Aqua Nautilus researchers deploy honeypots that mimic real-world development environments. During a recent threat-hunting operation, they uncovered a surprising new attack vector: threat actors using misconfigured servers to hijack environments for streaming sports events. By exploiting misconfigured JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook applications, attackers drop live streaming capture tools and duplicate the broadcast on their illegal server, thus conducting stream ripping. In this blog, we explain how our threat hunting operation helped us uncover this and how we analyzed this attack using Aqua Tracee and Traceeshark.  </p>

<p>Long time no see, Aqua Nautilus researchers have identified a new campaign in the making by TeamTNT, a notorious hacking group. In this campaign, TeamTNT appears to be returning to its roots while preparing for a large-scale attack on cloud native environments. The group is currently targeting exposed Docker daemons to deploy Sliver malware, a cyber worm, and cryptominers, using compromised servers and Docker Hub as the infrastructure to spread their malware.  </p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>TikTok has requested an emergency injunction to stop or postpone the planned ban on the platform in the US.</p>
<p>Back in March, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would effectively ban TikTok from the US unless Chinese owner ByteDance agreed to give up its share of the immensely popular app.</p>
<p>TikTok claims this is censorship and collides with the principle of free speech. However, the company’s post on X got a lot of responses from people who feel TikTok itself banned them for no clear reason.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The US government launched a national security investigation into the popular, Chinese-owned router maker TP-Link, with a potential eye on banning the company’s devices in the United States.</p>
<p>The investigation comes amid heightened tension between the US and the Chinese government, and after a public letter from members of the US House of Representatives this summer that alleged that TP-Link was engaged in predatory pricing practices, driven by ulterior motives, and possibly sponsored by China. US officials noted how TP-Link undercut the competition on price to become the market leader for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network appliances.</p>
