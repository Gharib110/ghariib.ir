		<p>Early last year we wrote about China Facing Problems With Android Handsets &amp; Pre-installed Trojans, then later last year there was a possibility Cybercrooks May Be Able To Force Mobile Phones To Send Premium-Rate SMS Messages. The latest news about Android malware is malicious apps that are in the official Google marketplace (called Play) – […]</p>

		<p>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.</p>
<p>This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.</p>

This time 2 million records from over 820,000 accounts have been leaked due to yet another default MongoDB installation with no authentication listening on the public IP address. The terrible part is, […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Following shortly after the .io domain cock-up that left thousands vulnerable to domain hijacking, this week more than 750 domains were jacked via registrar Gandi. Seems like some pretty sloppy administration going on, but that’s how business goes sadly security is still a very much reactive trade. People don’t enable strict controls and audit unless […]</p>
