That’s not an exhaustive list, indeed there are more videos on this blog and yet more phone calls that never made it here.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The COM Hijacking technique is often utilized by threat actors and various malware families to achieve both persistence and privilege escalation in target systems. It relies on manipulating Component Object Model (COM), exploiting the core architecture of Windows that enables communication between software components, by adding a new value on a specific registry key related to the COM object itself.</p>
<p>We studied the usage of this technique by different malware samples to pinpoint the most exploited COM objects in 2023.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Compact Key Storage in the Standard Model</strong><br>
<em>Yevgeniy Dodis, Daniel Jost</em></p>
<p>In recent work [Crypto'24], Dodis, Jost, and Marcedone introduced Compact Key Storage (CKS) as a modern approach to backup for end-to-end (E2E) secure applications. As most E2E-secure applications rely on a sequence of secrets $(s_1,&hellip;,s_n)$ from which, together with the ciphertexts sent over the network, all content can be restored, Dodis et al. introduced CKS as a primitive for backing up $(s_1,&hellip;,s_n)$. The authors provided definitions as well as two practically efficient schemes (with different functionality-efficiency trade-offs). Both, their security definitions and schemes relied however on the random oracle model (ROM).</p>

	<div>
		<p>We are pleased to announce the integration of a new solution into our Crowdsourced AI initiative. This model, developed by Dr. Ran Dubin from the Department of Computer Science at Ariel University and head of ByteDefend Cyber Lab at the Ariel Cyber Innovation Center, is designed to analyze suspicious macros in Microsoft Office files, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>VirusTotal&rsquo;s Crowdsourced AI initiative leverages various AI models and community contributions to strengthen cyber defense strategies. Like any other security solution, AI-based models are not infallible, but they offer invaluable contributions by complementing other technologies in analyzing and detecting new threats. The integration of ByteDefend enhances VirusTotal&rsquo;s Code Insight capabilities, currently with up to three independent AI engines for Microsoft Office documents.</p>
