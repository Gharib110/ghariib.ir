		<p>Valve broke new ground with the Steam Deck that launched PC handhelds into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>When Valve launched the Steam Machines in 2015, it was hardly to any kind of acclaim. It was an interesting idea: creating a Linux-based PC to provide a console-like gaming experience. SteamOS was in its infancy here, and while the Steam Machines flopped, Valve wasn‚Äôt done with trying to bring their own platform to market.</p>

		<p>Your home server&rsquo;s data isn&rsquo;t backed up unless you have an offsite storage solution.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a home server, you probably already have your devices backing up their data to your storage pools. But that&rsquo;s not the only place you should be storing backups, as the 3-2-1 backup rule means you should have one copy of your data at an offsite location. That could be a cloud storage service or a physical machine that&rsquo;s further away than your garage, but for any truly important data, it&rsquo;s a necessary cost to keep it safe.</p>

		<p>As the virtualization space evolves, many customers need to update their traditional virtualization strategies. Organizations are choosing to adopt a virtualization strategy to avoid the rising costs of managing legacy systems and the inability to scale to meet business demands1. A feature of Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization allows users to run and manage virtual machine workloads alongside containers. It supports both hybrid and multicloud environments and provides one unified platform for virtual machines and containers.Migrating to OpenShift Virtualization offers the flex</p>

<p>Bluetooth is a good way to connect devices that are near each other. However, it can drain batteries which is one reason Bluetooth Low Energy ‚Äî BLE ‚Äî exists. [Drmph] shows how easy it is to deploy BLE to make, in this case, a doorbell. He even shows how you can refit an existing doorbell to use the newer technology.</p>
<p>Like many projects, this one started out of necessity. The existing wireless doorbell failed, but it was difficult to find a new unit with good review. Cheap doorbells tend to ring spuriously due to interference. BLE, of course, doesn‚Äôt have that problem. Common BLE modules make up the bulk of the project. It is easy enough to add your own style to the doorbell like a voice announcement or musical playback. The transmitter is little more than a switch, the module, a coin cell, and an LED.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A New Paradigm for Server-Aided MPC</strong><br>
<em>Alessandra Scafuro, Tanner Verber</em></p>
<p>The server-aided model for multiparty computation (MPC) was introduced to capture a real-world scenario where clients wish to off-load the heavy computation of MPC protocols to dedicated servers. A rich body of work has studied various trade-offs between security guarantees (e.g., semi-honest vs malicious), trust assumptions (e.g., the threshold on corrupted servers), and efficiency.</p>
<p>However, all existing works make the assumption that all clients must agree on employing the same servers, and accept the same corruption threshold. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and introduce a new paradigm for server-aided MPC, where each client can choose their own set of servers and their own threshold of corrupted servers. In this new model, the privacy of each client is guaranteed as long as their own threshold is satisfied, regardless of the other servers/clients. We call this paradigm per-party private server-aided MPC to highlight both a security and efficiency guarantee: (1) per-party privacy, which means that each party gets their own privacy guarantees that depend on their own choice of the servers; (2) per-party complexity, which means that each party only needs to communicate with their chosen servers. Our primary contribution is a new theoretical framework for server-aided MPC. We provide two protocols to show feasibility, but leave it as a future work to investigate protocols that focus on concrete efficiency.</p>

		<p>Over the past decade, the DORA metrics have been instrumental in measuring developer productivity and software delivery performance ‚Äî¬†my collaboration with Dr. Nicole Forsgren and Jez Humble from 2013 to 2019 remains one of the things I‚Äôm most professionally proud of in my career.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been working with Steve Yegge (Yes, that Steve Yegge, famous for his work at Amazon, Google, and his depiction of the famous Jeff Bezos ‚Äúthou shalt communicate only by APIs‚Äù memo) and a group of amazing group of researchers and practitioners who are seeking to quantify the value of GenAI for developers. I‚Äôm excited that this could potentially build upon the amazing DORA work that continues at Google (hello, Nathen Harvey and Dr. Derek DeBellis!)</p>
