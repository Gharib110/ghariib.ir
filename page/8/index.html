<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-29927<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> March 21, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 22 hours, 47 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Prior to 14.2.25 and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 14.2.25 and 15.2.3.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 9.1 | CRITICAL<br>
