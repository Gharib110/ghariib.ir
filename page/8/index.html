<p>Digitization has significantly changed manufacturing over the past 25 years. The benefits include reducing inventory costs and machine downtime, and boosting throughput and forecasting accuracy. But as digitization has grown in prevalence, so have the security challenges facing manufacturers. This includes ransomware, legacy systems that are hard to patch, and third-party risk, among other types of threats. At the turn of the 21st century, production facilities were using software in various areas, but these systems were rarely integrated, and departments often operated in silos. Robotic assembly lines were already well established – primarily in the automotive industry – but were […]</p>

		<p><em>This is the second part of a two three four-part series, which covers some recent results on “verifiable computation” and possible pitfalls that could occur there. This post won’t make much sense on its own, so I urge you to start with the first part.</em></p>
<p>In the previous post we introduced a handful of concepts, including (1) the notion of “verifiable computation” proof systems (sometimes inaccurately called “ZK” by the Ethereum community), (2) hash functions, and (3) some ideal models that we use for our security proofs, and (4) the idea that these “ideal models” are bogus — and sometimes they can make us confident in schemes that are totally insecure in the real world.</p>

		<p><em>This is the third and penultimate post in a series about theoretical weaknesses in Fiat-Shamir as applied to proof systems. The first post is here, the second post is here, and you should probably read them.</em></p>
<p>Over the past two posts I’ve given a bit of background on four subjects: (1) interactive proof systems (for general programs/circuits), (2) the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, (3) random oracles. We’ve also talked about (4) recursive proofs, which will be important but are not <em>immediately</em> relevant.</p>

		<p>The fourth episode is dedicated to the most analyzed family of applications: communication and social networking apps.</p>
<p>Before I start, I would like to mention that I have made some corrections to the previous blog post, based on feedback by tool developers. Also, most of them have confirmed to me that they are working on improving their parsing capabilities, based on this blog series. I am happy to support them in that direction!</p>

		<p>I am finally back with the third blog post in the series!</p>
<p>Before I introduce this new post, I want to point out some updates to the previous blog post. </p>
<p>I have corrected a couple of errors related to the Belkasoft tool, in particular the device UDID and the device phone number.</p>
<p>Also, after the blog post, Alexis Brignoni released some new iLEAPP parsers that cover most of the “red” boxes and MSAB confirmed to me that they have already fixed all the “red” boxes from the previous blog post. At the end of the series, I will re-process the dataset with the latest version of the various tools, and create a separate table with the updated comparison.</p>

		<p>As explained in the first blog post, I would like to start discussing the acquisition and processing details.</p>
<p>The acquisition was done by Josh Hickman using the Cellebrite Premium tool and the result is a Full File System capture in the traditional file format created by UFED.</p>
<p>If you open the file EXTRACTION _FFS.zip ZIP you will see that UFED organizes the extracted full file system into 5 subfolders;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>filesystem1</strong>: extraction of system partition, without the mount point “/private/var/mobile/” (“user data&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>filesystem2:</strong> extraction of the mount point for user data (“/private/var/mobile”)</li>
<li><strong>metadata1:</strong> metadata for files stored in “filesystem1”</li>
<li><strong>metadata1:</strong> metadata for files stored in “filesystem2”</li>
<li><strong>extra:</strong> iOS Keychain</li>
</ul>
