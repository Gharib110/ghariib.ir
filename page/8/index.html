	<div>
		<p>With financial stress at an all-time high, and many Americans grappling with confusion about social security, Medicaid, and Medicare, people are desperately seeking relief. Scammers know this all too well and have tailored their tactics to exploit these fears, preying on vulnerable individuals with promises of “free money.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s a so-called “subsidy program,” a “government grant,” or a “relief card,” these scams all share the same underlying goal—to manipulate people into giving away their personal information, or—worse—their hard-earned cash. </p>

		<p>As companies rapidly adopt AI technologies, CISOs face a new frontier of security challenges. Many security leaders find themselves grappling with unfamiliar questions: How do we evaluate AI vendors differently from traditional software vendors? What security controls matter most? Where does vendor responsibility end and customer responsibility begin? How do we evaluate AI security risks within the context of the service provided? To help answer these questions, we’ve created the GitLab AI Security Framework to show security leaders how GitLab and customers enable secure AI-powered development using GitLab Duo.</p>

<p>For an internal event atCryptomathic, we invited some our clients from the financial and trust service sectors to share their insight on future trends around our solutions. We had expected topics such as post quantum cryptography, the use of confidential computing to secure the transition to cloud, targeted threats from groups that want to destabilise high street banks and the economy to be the number one concern.</p>

<p>The financial sector serves as the backbone of the global economy, making it one of the most targeted industries for cyber attacks. As online banking, mobile transactions, and fintech innovations expand, cyber threats continue to evolve. Cyber criminals continuously exploit vulnerabilities in financial applications, making strong security measures essential for protecting sensitive customer data, transactions, and business operations. To mitigate these risks, efficient web application firewalls (WAFs) have become a crucial security mechanism for financial services. In recent GigaOm Radar for Application and API Security report, GigaOm emphasizes the critical role of integrated security measures in today’s digital landscape. The […]</p>

		<p>Imagine this: You are an engineer at a growing tech company, and it’s 2 a.m. when you get an urgent call. A critical deployment pipeline has failed, and your team is scrambling to figure out why. After hours of digging, you realize someone revoked a personal access token belonging to an engineer who left the company a week ago. This token was tied to several key automation processes, and now your entire system is in chaos. How do you make sure it does not happen again?</p>

The default wallpaper for Ubuntu 25.04 ‘Plucky Puffin’ has been unveiled. Each new Ubuntu release bears a bespoke desktop background and animal mascot, and the upcoming release of the Plucky Puffin proves no exception. Ubuntu 25.04’s default wallpaper makes heavy use of the nautical motifs proffered by its codename animal (a puffin). Avian art is, as per, placed atop a purple gradient background1 with trademark polygonal edge detailing: The “colour” version above is the stock default, but there are 4 variants in total: colour, light, dimmed, and dark (used in dark mode). Users can set any of those as their […]</p>

		<p>Development and security teams are often overwhelmed by the number of vulnerabilities they need to remediate. Many organizations remediate less than 16% of their known vulnerabilities monthly. Vulnerability management teams face a constant challenge: which security flaws deserve immediate attention? Three key frameworks help answer this question: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV), and Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). The GitLab 17.9 release adds support for these frameworks. In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use these frameworks within GitLab to efficiently prioritize risk across your dependency and container image vulnerabilities using this data.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I&rsquo;ve finally caught my breath after dealing with those 23 billion rows of stealer logs last week. That was a bit intense, as is usually the way after any large incident goes into HIBP. But the confusing nature of stealer logs coupled with an overtly long blog post explaining them and the conflation of which services needed a subscription versus which were easily accessible by anyone made for a very intense last 6 days. And there were the issues around source data integrity on top of everything else, but I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p>
