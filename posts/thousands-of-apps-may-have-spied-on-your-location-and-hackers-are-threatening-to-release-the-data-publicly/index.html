				<p>There are thousands of apps on the list, and you probably have at least some of them installed.</p>
<p>We all know that apps collect our data, but what do companies do with that data? Some sell it, some use it for targeted advertising, some use it to help you connect with other users nearby, and there are countless other ways it can be used too. In a nightmare scenario, a firm that collects that data from thousands of apps has been hacked, with the hackers threatening to release all of the data publicly. This data includes customer lists, information about the industry, and historical location information collected from smartphones.</p>
