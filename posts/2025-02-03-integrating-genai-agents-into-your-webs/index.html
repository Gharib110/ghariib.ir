However, remember that these “free” alternatives might have usage restrictions or lack some advanced features compared to paid subscriptions.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-api-access-and-authentication"><a href="#set-up-api-access-and-authentication">Set Up API Access and Authentication</a><a href="#set-up-api-access-and-authentication"></a></h3>
<p>After selecting a platform, the subsequent step involves getting API access and handling authentication. Most providers will have a developer portal that enables you to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create an Account</strong>: Sign up for a developer account if you haven’t already done it.</li>
<li><strong>Generate API Keys</strong>: Usually, you’ll find a way to create one or more API keys.</li>
<li><strong>Configure Permissions</strong>: Some providers let you limit keys to certain IP addresses or set usage caps.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: If you’re working with OpenAI’s GPT, you can generate a secret key right from the account dashboard. Then, you’ll typically need to include this key in the request header when making calls to the API from your backend.</p>
<p>The below curl command submits a POST request to the chat completions API endpoint provided by OpenAI. It sets the content type as JSON and incorporates an authorization header containing the API key for authentication purposes. The request body specifies the <em>gpt-4o-mini</em> model, includes a user inquiry regarding the GenAI agent integration into its website, and restricts the response to a maximum of 150 tokens.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; \
  -H &#34;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#34; \
  -d &#39;{
    &#34;model&#34;: &#34;gpt-4o-mini&#34;,
    &#34;messages&#34;: [{&#34;role&#34;: &#34;user&#34;, &#34;content&#34;: &#34;Hello, how to integrate a GenAI agent into my website?&#34;}],
    &#34;max_tokens&#34;: 150
  }&#39;
</code></pre><p>To execute the specified curl command to interact with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction">OpenAI’s API</a>, it is important to make sure that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify the curl installation on your system by executing curl &ndash;version in your terminal.</li>
<li>Confirm that your account has access to the <em>gpt-4o-mini</em> model. Access may be restricted depending on your subscription or account status.</li>
<li>Use the /v1/chat/completions endpoint for chat-based use and ensure that the JSON data specified by the—d flag is formatted accurately. The messages field should contain an array of objects, each containing a role and content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Tip</strong>: Always keep your API keys secure and never share them in public repositories or client-side code. Use environment variables and role-based access controls to reduce potential risks.</p>
<p>When integrating with APIs, it’s important to review the specific documentation associated with the API to understand the required header formats, as such formats may differ among various services. For example, OpenAI’s API uses the Authorization header in the format <em>‘Bearer YOUR_API_KEY</em>’ for authentication. However, other APIs might implement alternative header names or authentication methods. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/">generate API keys</a> from DigitalOcean’s dashboard for authentication.</p>
<p>Proper key management is important, as poor handling can create security risks and enable unauthorized access.

<p><strong>JavaScript Integration</strong><br>
Several service providers offer the possibility of including a small JavaScript code snippet in your HTML.</p>
<p>The HTML template below is designed to weave a generative AI chat widget into your webpage. It features a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> element bearing the ID chat widget, serving as the heart of the chat interface. The JavaScript function initializeGenAI() springs into action, initializing the AI agent service by connecting the chat widget to the AI’s backend upon the page’s load event. This configuration paves the way for a lively and engaging AI chat experience on your site!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;GenAI Agent&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- Add a chat widget--&gt;
  &lt;div id=&#34;chat-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;script&gt;
        // start by initializing your selected AI agent service
        // This could involve a script provided by the vendor
        //  or your personalized code that interacts with the AI&#39;s API
        const initializeGenAI = () =&gt; {
        // Example pseudocode
        const chatb = document.getElementById(&#39;chat-widget&#39;);
        // Implement your UI logic here to connect with the AI&#39;s backend
        };

        window.onload = initializeGenAI;
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p><strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong><br>
If your website operates on a server-side framework such as Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel, it could be advantageous to incorporate the AI agent directly at the backend. Then, you can relay the generated content to the front end for display. This approach is particularly beneficial for executing more complex logic and transformations that happen on the server.<br>
For example, to embed an AI agent into your Django application, you can use the <a href="https://vintasoftware.github.io/django-ai-assistant/latest/get-started/">django-ai-assistant</a> package, which simplifies the addition of AI functionalities to your project.</p>
