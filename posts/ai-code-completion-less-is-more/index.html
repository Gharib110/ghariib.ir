<p>In this blog post, we’ll break down why and how we got the results without retraining our generation model. </p>
<h2 id="man-shall-not-live-on-llm-alone">Man shall not live on LLM alone</h2>
<p>The LLM that provides your code suggestions is the heart of AI-powered code completion, but it’s not the whole show. There’s a ton happening behind the scenes, in particular on the plugin side, like deciding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When to show a suggestion. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a suggestion should be single-line or multi-line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which suggestions to show or conceal – for instance, a suggestion could be semantically incorrect, score too low, or use offensive or inappropriate language. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But sometimes, defining the filtering rules is not that straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-are-trying-to-achieve">What we are trying to achieve</h2>
<p>Simply put, we want to show you only the suggestions you’ll actually use. That means fewer unwanted suggestions – ones you’ll cancel, edit, or delete – without losing the power of our code completion feature. In terms of metrics, we’re working to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase the acceptance rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut down the explicit cancel rate and the percentage of edited/deleted suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain or increase the ratio of completed code. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="all-you-need-is-logs">All you need is logs</h2>
<p>So, how do we achieve all of this? The obvious answer is to improve the completion model. </p>
<p>However, it’s not that simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s expensive and time-consuming. Training a better model takes a lot of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t see where things go wrong. We don’t store users’ code, so we can’t analyze bad suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context alone isn’t enough – things like user behavior and how a suggestion fits with nearby lines also matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lightweight-local-filter-model">Lightweight local filter model</h3>
<p>Instead of going down that long road of improving the completion LLM, we took a different approach: a lightweight local filter model.</p>
<p>This model runs on top of the completion LLM and is trained using anonymized logs.</p>
<p>The model helps decide whether a suggestion should be shown by analyzing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The file/project context (like the language used as well as the number and type of imports) and the completion context (like features that describe a caret location). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User behavior</strong>: The typing speed and the time spent since last typing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The suggestion itself</strong>: Whether references are resolved, if the suggestion repeats itself or is similar to surrounding lines, and additional model outputs like token scores and token entropy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>The job of the lightweight local filter model is simple: it decides whether to accept or reject a suggestion based on your actions. However, we’ve guided the model a bit during training. We gave extra weight to explicit user actions, like when you explicitly accept or cancel a suggestion. If you edit or delete a suggestion after accepting it, we treat it as less of a win – the more you change, the less weight it gets.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the model is built with CatBoost, which is efficient and doesn’t need tons of data. The model is specifically designed to be lightweight – once trained, it becomes a compact 2.5 MB file and runs directly in Kotlin on users’ machines, making predictions in 1–2 milliseconds.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-have-achieved">What we have achieved</h2>
<p>Our A/B tests in the EAP showed great results, and they’re getting even better. The filter model boosted the acceptance rate by ~50% and cut the explicit cancel rate by ~40%, all while keeping the ratio of completed code steady.</p>
<p>We officially rolled out the filter model in version 2024.1 of JetBrains IDEs for a range of languages, including Java, Kotlin, Python, PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, CSS, and Ruby. In later versions we also covered C#, C++, Rust, and HCL, plus the local filter model for cloud completion with Mellum in Python, Java, and Kotlin. We plan to cover even more languages soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both the local code completion model and the lightweight local filter model continue to evolve and improve together.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-have-learned">What we have learned</h2>
<p>Even if your LLM is already doing a great job, there’s always room for improvement. You don’t always need massive, complex models to make a difference. Sometimes, the smart use of extra data like logs can do the trick. So, what’s next for AI-powered code completion? How far can we push it?</p>
