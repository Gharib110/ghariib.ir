<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 10, 2025</p>
<p>TechRound, the voice of UK startups, reports that cybercrime will cost the world more than $10 trillion annually by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.</p>
<p>Daniel Tobok’s concept of Cyber Certainty has become a guiding principle for organizations seeking to navigate increasingly sophisticated digital threats. His new book, “Cyber Certainty: Threat Reduction for Business Leaders“, is an indispensable resource, empowering seasoned executives as well as young entrepreneurs to take charge of their company’s cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>Cyber Certainty encourages organizations to think beyond immediate risks, adopting strategies emphasizing resilience and preparedness.</p>
<p>Tobok’s work over the years includes over 10,000 cyberattack reviews and thousands of successful recoveries. His new paperback is recommended reading for anyone responsible for navigating the digital threats that loom over businesses today.</p>
