				<p>We have put together a project proposal as part of our application to participate in the Google Season of Docs 2022 program.</p>
<h3 id="project-proposal">Project proposal</h3>
<h4 id="better-documentation-for-real-world-use-cases---jenkins-x">Better documentation for real world use cases - Jenkins X</h4>
<h5 id="about-us">About us</h5>
<p>Jenkins X provides automated CI/CD for Kubernetes with Preview Environments on Pull Requests using Cloud Native pipelines from Tekton.</p>
<h5 id="problem">Problem</h5>
<ul>
<li>End users of Jenkins X are unable to find information on how to use Jenkins X for real world use cases which includes:
<ul>
<li>Production best practices</li>
<li>Scanning images in Jenkins X pipelines</li>
<li>How to make your app use different configuration/secrets for each environment</li>
<li>Observability for your apps, logging, metrics, tracing</li>
<li>Tests (Integration, e2e)</li>
<li>Artifact management</li>
<li>Multi cluster</li>
<li>Integration with other tools in the cloud native sector</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="project-scope">Project scope</h5>
<ul>
<li>Audit the current Jenkins X documentation and create a friction log</li>
<li>Use the friction log as a guide for understanding the gaps in the documentation</li>
<li>Interact with the Jenkins X community to create a list of top use cases
<ul>
<li>Create a survey</li>
<li>Look at the github issues and slack messages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work with the volunteers to incorporate those changes into the documentation</li>
<li>Establish a feedback loop (the target customers are the end users of Jenkins X) to improve the documentation</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="measuring-project-success">Measuring project success</h5>
<ul>
<li>Decrease in the number of github issues raised by end users on documentation related to common real world use cases</li>
<li>Short 1-2 minute videos on common tasks that end users of Jenkins X would like to perform.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="recommended-skills">Recommended skills</h5>
<ul>
<li>Must have:
<ul>
<li>Experience with github</li>
<li>Communication skills to work with the Jenkins X community</li>
<li>Creating online surveys</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nice to have:
<ul>
<li>Basic experience with docker compose (local development scripts use compose)</li>
<li>Good video editing skills.</li>
<li>Some knowledge working with the documentation of other tools in the kubernetes ecosystem</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>The project will take roughly 6 months to complete. Once the technical writer is selected, we will do an orientation to bring him up to speed. This is the timeline we have in mind, but we are flexible.</p>

<h4 id="notes-about-budget">Notes about budget</h4>
<ul>
<li>The cost of the t-shirt was taken from here.</li>
<li>The t-shirts are for the technical writer, volunteers and any member of the jenkins X community (not officially listed as a volunteer) who helps out by answering the technical writer‚Äôs questions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Previous participation in Season of Docs, Google Summer of Code or others
<ul>
<li>Jenkins X participated in the 2020 Season of docs. The maturity level matrix created by the technical writer is still used by the community to evaluate if Jenkins X will work for their use case, as well as used by the Jenkins X maintainers to plan the roadmap for improving Jenkins X.</li>
<li>Jenkins X is also participating in the google summer of code 2022. We are seeing a lot of interest from new contributors. We are confident it will lead to some amazing improvements in the Jenkins X ecosystem and make it a sustainable open source project. We expect the technical writer will help the contributors create better documentation for their work.</li>

<li>The documentation does not feel coherent, it does not read like a book from start to finish
<ul>
<li>There‚Äôs no clear flow about how people should read documentation and no ‚Äúnext step‚Äù once they‚Äôve finished reading a page.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs also a lot of missing <em>assumed</em> knowledge in the documentation which makes it hard for new users to form a mental picture of Jenkins X</li>
