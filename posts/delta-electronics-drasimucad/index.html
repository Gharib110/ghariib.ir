<p>rgod working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.</p>
<h2 id="4-mitigations">4. MITIGATIONS</h2>
<p>Delta Electronics will release a new version of DRASimuCAD in January 2025 to address these issues and recommends users install this update on all affected systems.</p>
<p>For more information, please see the Delta product cybersecurity advisory for these issues.</p>
<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>
<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>
<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.</p>
<p>Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B&ndash;Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>
<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>
<p>CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.</li>
<li>Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.</li>
<li>Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.</p>
