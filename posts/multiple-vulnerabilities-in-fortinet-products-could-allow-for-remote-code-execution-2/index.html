			<h1>Multiple Vulnerabilities in Fortinet Products Could Allow for Remote Code Execution</h1>

			<div>
				<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console.</li>
<li>FortiManager Cloud is a cloud-based service for centralized management, monitoring, and automation of Fortinet devices across multiple sites</li>
<li>FortiOS is the Fortinet’s proprietary Operation System which is utilized across multiple product lines.</li>
<li>FortiProxy is a secure web gateway that attempts to protects users against internet-borne attacks, and provides protection and visibility to the network against unauthorized access and threats.</li>
<li>FortiAnalyzer is a log management, analytics, and reporting platform that provides organizations with a single console to manage, automate, orchestrate, and respond, enabling simplified security operations, proactive identification and remediation of risks, and complete visibility of the entire attack landscape..</li>
<li>FortiSandbox 5.0 is a security solution that utilizes a combination of AI/ML, static, and dynamic analysis, inline blocking, and scalable virtual environments to identify, analyze, contextualize, prioritize, and protect against advanced threats in real-time.</li>
<li>FortiPAM provides privileged account management, session monitoring and management, and role-based access control to secure access to sensitive assets and mitigate data breaches.</li>
<li>FortiNDR is Fortinet&rsquo;s AI-driven Network Detection and Response (NDR) solution.</li>
<li>FortiWeb is a web application firewall (WAF) that protects web applications and APIs from attacks that target known and unknown exploits and helps maintain compliance with regulations.</li>
<li>FortiSIEM is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution from Fortinet that provides real-time infrastructure and user awareness for accurate threat detection, analysis, and reporting.</li>
<li>FortiIsolator is a Fortinet browser isolation solution that protects users from web-borne threats by creating a visual air gap between users&rsquo; browsers and websites, executing web content in a remote, disposable container.</li>
<li>Fortimail is like a Swiss army knife for email, consisting of anti-spam, anti-virus, content filtering, DLP and email archiving.</li>
<li>FortiClient is a Fabric Agent that delivers protection, compliance, and secure access in a single, modular lightweight client.</li>
<li>FortiADC is an application delivery controller (ADC) with advanced security features that help ensure application security, availability, and optimization, </li>
</ul>
<p>Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
