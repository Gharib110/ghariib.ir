<p>Curating open source code or compiled DLLs from the NuGet public package repository is a common practice for .NET developers. It is fairly easy to search for appropriate packages, and eliminates time spent reinventing wheels, axles, headlights, seat-belts, etc.. In a <a href="https://opensource.org/blog/2023-state-of-open-source-report-key-findings-and-analysis">2023 survey</a>, 80% of respondents increased the use of open source in their organizations over the last year.</p>
<p>This ease and productivity boost of NuGet and other repositories prompts most developers to download their chosen packages onto their laptops, include them in their software, and run various functional tests. However, with the <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/sscs-report">1300% growth in malicious open source packages</a> in the last two years, repositories like NuGet are increasingly hosting malicious and suspicious packages that can fool developers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, RL announced the <a href="https://secure.software/">Spectra Assure Community</a>, the largest free community resource for vetting open source software packages in npm, PyPi, and RubyGems repositories. Its simple search interface enables users to quickly check real-time risk assessment summaries before choosing or updating open source packages. The community site keeps track of more than 50,000 unique malicious packages, of which more than 5,000 were first reported by the RL research team. Threat intelligence found on this website is shared with the open source community to help with removing malicious code from package repositories.</p>
