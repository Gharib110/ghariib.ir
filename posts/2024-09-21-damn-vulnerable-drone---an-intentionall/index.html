<p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone is an intentionally vulnerable drone hacking simulator based on the popular ArduPilot/MAVLink architecture, providing a realistic environment for hands-on drone hacking.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-damn-vulnerable-drone">About the Damn Vulnerable Drone</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-damn-vulnerable-drone">What is the Damn Vulnerable Drone?</h2>
<p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone is a virtually simulated environment designed for offensive security professionals to safely learn and practice drone hacking techniques. It simulates real-world <a href="https://ardupilot.org/" title="ArduPilot">ArduPilot</a> &amp; <a href="https://mavlink.io/en/" title="MAVLink">MAVLink</a> drone architectures and <a href="https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/vulnerabilities" title="vulnerabilities">vulnerabilities</a>, offering a hands-on experience in exploiting drone systems.</p>
<h2 id="why-was-it-built">Why was it built?</h2>
<p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone aims to enhance offensive security skills within a controlled environment, making it an invaluable tool for intermediate-level security professionals, pentesters, and hacking enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Similar to how pilots utilize flight simulators for training, we can use the Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator to gain in-depth knowledge of real-world drone systems, understand their vulnerabilities, and learn effective methods to exploit them.</p>
<p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform is open-source and available at no cost and was specifically designed to address the substantial expenses often linked with drone hardware, hacking tools, and maintenance. Its cost-free nature allows users to immerse themselves in drone hacking without financial concerns. This accessibility makes the Damn Vulnerable Drone a crucial resource for those in the fields of information security and penetration testing, promoting the development of offensive <a href="https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Cybersecurity" title="cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> skills in a safe environment.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform operates on the principle of <a href="https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html" title="Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)">Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)</a>, a simulation technique that allows users to run drone software as if it were executing on an actual drone, thereby replicating authentic drone behaviors and responses.</p>
<p>ArduPilot&rsquo;s SITL allows for the execution of the drone&rsquo;s firmware within a virtual environment, mimicking the behavior of a real drone without the need for physical hardware. This simulation is further enhanced with Gazebo, a dynamic 3D robotics simulator, which provides a realistic environment and physics engine for the drone to interact with. Together, ArduPilot&rsquo;s SITL and Gazebo lay the foundation for a sophisticated and authentic drone simulation experience.</p>
<p>While the current Damn Vulnerable Drone setup doesn&rsquo;t mirror every drone architecture or configuration, the integrated tactics, techniques and scenarios are broadly applicable across various drone systems, models and communication protocols.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker-based Environment</strong>: Runs in a completely virtualized docker-based setup, making it accessible and safe for drone hacking experimentation.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated Wireless Networking</strong>: Simulated Wifi (802.11) interfaces to practice wireless drone attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Onboard Camera Streaming &amp; Gimbal</strong>: Simulated RTSP drone onboard camera stream with gimbal and companion computer integration.</li>
<li><strong>Companion Computer Web Interface</strong>: Companion Computer configuration management via web interface and simulated serial connection to Flight Controller.</li>
<li><strong>QGroundControl/MAVProxy Integration</strong>: One-click QGroundControl UI launching (only supported on x86 architecture) with MAVProxy GCS integration.</li>
<li><strong>MAVLink Router Integration</strong>: Telemetry forwarding via MAVLink Router on the Companion Computer Web Interface.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Flight Logging</strong>: Fully dynamic Ardupilot flight bin logs stored on a simulated SD Card.</li>
<li><strong>Management Web Console</strong>: Simple to use simulator management web console used to trigger scenarios and drone flight states.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Hacking Scenarios</strong>: Ideal for practicing a wide range of drone hacking techniques, from basic reconnaissance to advanced exploitation.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Walkthroughs</strong>: If you need help hacking against a particular scenario you can leverage the detailed walkthrough documentation as a spoiler.</li>
