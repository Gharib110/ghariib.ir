				<p>It’s an exciting time to be a managed service provider (MSP). More than ever, small and medium businesses (SMBs) are looking to MSPs as trusted advisors to help safeguard them from today’s growing cyber threats. One of the services in high demand right now? Managed detection and response (MDR). When asked about their biggest growth drivers, MSPs cite addressing clients’ cybersecurity concerns and awareness as the top new-business drivers (54%).1</p>
<p>For MSPs, adding MDR to your lineup can create new revenue streams while enhancing the value you bring to your clients. By offering OpenText MDR to your MSP clients, you gain access to skilled security experts and advanced technology infrastructure—without the complexity and cost of building it all in-house.</p>
<p>Here’s why more MSPs are partnering with OpenText to power their MDR security services:</p>
<h2 id="1-seamless-integration-with-your-existing-tools">1. Seamless integration with your existing tools</h2>
<p>One of the greatest advantages of choosing OpenText MDR is its compatibility with your existing tools. OpenText MDR easily integrates with over 500 third-party tools, using APIs so you can add MDR services to your offerings without disrupting your current technology stack.</p>
<p>This flexibility also extends to popular professional services automation (PSA) tools, allowing for smooth incident ticketing and vulnerability management within your established workflows. With OpenText MDR, you can confidently grow your service portfolio while keeping your partner ecosystem intact.</p>
<h2 id="2-grow-your-revenue-with-flexible-hassle-free-licensing">2. Grow your revenue with flexible, hassle-free licensing</h2>
<p>With cybersecurity top of mind, MSPs are seeing a surge in demand for security services. OpenText MDR helps you capitalize on this opportunity with a subscription-based model designed to grow with you—risk-free.</p>
<p>There are no long-term contracts, hidden fees, or minimums—just the freedom to scale your MDR services month-to-month, at your own pace, and based on your clients’ evolving needs. This flexibility lets you capture new revenue streams without overextending your resources.</p>
<h2 id="3-enhancing-edr-with-siem-and-soar-capabilities">3. Enhancing EDR with SIEM and SOAR capabilities</h2>
<p>Effective MDR requires more than simply monitoring a client’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution—it demands a comprehensive view of the entire attack surface. OpenText MDR delivers this by enhancing your client’s EDR with advanced SIEM and SOAR capabilities.</p>
<p>The platform features real-time monitoring—integrated SIEM and SOAR capabilities—enabling rapid threat detection and automated response across your clients’ environments. This advanced approach safeguards your clients from evolving threats on all fronts—from endpoint to cloud.</p>
<h2 id="4-automation-combined-with-human-expertise">4. Automation combined with human expertise</h2>
<p>OpenText MDR brings together the speed of automation and the skill of experienced security analysts. This blend ensures that threats are detected quickly, incidents are prioritized with care, and responses are expertly managed around the clock, every day of the year. You get the best of both worlds—cutting-edge technology and dedicated human oversight that augments your MSP team.</p>
<p>With OpenText MDR, you can confidently offer clients a proactive, always-on defense against evolving threats—without the need to build up your own in-house security team.</p>
<h2 id="5-rapid-incident-response-and-proactive-threat-hunting">5. Rapid incident response and proactive threat hunting</h2>
<p>A speedy response is crucial to stopping adversaries in their tracks before they gain a foothold. MSPs can count on OpenText’s rapid incident response support, complete with dedicated escalation paths for high-priority threats, ensuring swift action when it matters most. You have the flexibility to choose whether you want the OpenText MDR team to completely manage threat response, or opt for co-managed support, where your team takes the lead with OpenText offering expert backup and resources.</p>
<p>OpenText MDR also delivers continuous, proactive threat hunting to identify and neutralize risks before they can affect client environments. This powerful combination of active threat hunting and fast response equips MSPs to provide clients with a robust, preemptive defense against emerging threats.</p>
