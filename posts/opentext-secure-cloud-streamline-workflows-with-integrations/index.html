 Secure Cloud provides billing reconciliation by integrating with popular tools such as HaloPSA, ConnectWise PSA, AutoTask, and Kaseya BMS so you can automate many of the processes that would typically require manual input. These integrations help boost efficiency and reduce human error.</p>
<h2 id="halopsa-integration-delivers">HaloPSA integration delivers:</h2>
<p><strong>Automatic invoice retrieval</strong>—The platform retrieves the monthly invoice from AppRiver, listing all recurring services purchased during the previous period.</p>
<p><strong>Effortless invoice comparison</strong>—At the touch of a button, you can compare and update any differences directly within HaloPSA.</p>
<p><strong>Simple setup</strong>—Link customers, recurring invoices, and products once and the system will remember your settings for next time.</p>
<h2 id="connectwise-psa-integration-delivers">ConnectWise PSA integration delivers:</h2>
<p><strong>Seamless invoice management</strong>—Similar to HaloPSA, the AppRiver invoice is automatically loaded into the platform, saving you time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>Easy linking</strong>—The first time you use the integration you can link companies, agreements, and products, ensuring that future invoice retrieval is smooth and fast.</p>
<p><strong>Customizable</strong>—If any agreements or products are missing in ConnectWise you can add them directly from within the platform.</p>
<h2 id="autotask-integration-delivers">AutoTask integration delivers:</h2>
<p><strong>Efficient invoice updates</strong>—The integration allows you to load and check AppRiver invoices quickly.</p>
<p><strong>One-time setup</strong>—Link your customers, contracts, and services once and the system will remember your settings for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Quick additions</strong>—If a contract or service is missing, it’s easy to create it within the platform, reducing downtime.</p>
<h2 id="kaseya-bms-integration-delivers">Kaseya BMS integration delivers:</h2>
<p><strong>Invoice and contract validation</strong>—AppRiver invoices are automatically retrieved and validated against your Kaseya BMS contracts, offering updates where needed.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>—If service quantities don’t match, you can update them directly within the system.</p>
<p><strong>Simple linking</strong>—Set up by linking customers, contracts, and services once and future updates will be swift and hassle-free.</p>
<p>These integrations with OpenText Secure Cloud help you manage recurring services, validate invoices, and update your systems effortlessly. They save you time, reduce errors, and enable a smoother, more connected workflow across multiple platforms.</p>
