<p>We’re still buzzing and recovering from the Black Hat and DEF CON conferences where we finished presenting our new [Kali Linux Dojo](](/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/), which was a blast. With the help of <strong>a few good people</strong>, the Dojo rooms were set up ready for the masses - where many <strong>generated their very own Kali 2.0 ISOs for the first time</strong>. But the excitement doesn’t end for us just yet. With the end of the cons, we now find ourselves smack in the middle of <strong>the most significant release of Kali since 2013</strong>. Today is the day that Kali 2.0 is officially released.</p>
<p><strong>So, what’s new in Kali 2.0?</strong> There’s a new 4.0 kernel, now based on Debian Jessie, improved hardware and wireless driver coverage, support for a variety of Desktop Environments (gnome, kde, xfce, mate, e17, lxde, i3wm), updated desktop environment and tools - and the list goes on. But these bulletpoint items are essentially a <strong>side effect of the real changes that have taken place</strong> in our development backend. Ready to hear the real news? <strong>Take a deep breath, it’s a long list</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="kali-linux-is-now-a-rolling-distribution">Kali Linux is Now a Rolling Distribution</h2>
<p>One of the biggest moves we’ve taken to keep Kali 2.0 <strong>up-to-date in a global, continuous manner,</strong> is transforming Kali into a <strong>rolling distribution.</strong> What this means is that we are pulling our packages continuously from <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/testing">Debian Testing</a> (after making sure that all packages are installable) - essentially upgrading the Kali core system, while allowing us to take advantage of newer Debian packages as they roll out. This move is where our choice in Debian as a base system really pays off - we get to enjoy the stability of Debian, while still remaining <em>on the cutting edge</em>.</p>
<h2 id="continuously-updated-tools-enhanced-workflow">Continuously Updated Tools, Enhanced Workflow</h2>
<p>Another interesting development in our infrastructure has been the integration of an <strong>upstream version checking system</strong>, which alerts us when new upstream versions of tools are released (usually via git tagging). This script runs daily on a select list of common tools and keeps us alerted if a new tool requires updating. With this new system in place, <strong>core tool updates will happen more frequently</strong>. With the introduction of this new monitoring system, we will slowly start phasing out the “tool upgrades” option in our <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker</a>.</p>
<h2 id="new-flavours-of-kali-linux-20">New Flavours of Kali Linux 2.0</h2>
<p>Through our Live Build process, Kali 2.0 now natively supports <strong>KDE, GNOME3, Xfce, MATE, e17, lxde and i3wm</strong>. We’ve moved on to <a href="https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME 3</a> in this release, marking the end of a long abstinence period. We’ve finally embraced GNOME 3 and with a few custom changes, it’s grown to be our favourite desktop environment. We’ve added custom support for multi-level menus, true terminal transparency, as well as a handful of useful gnome shell extensions. This however has come at a price - <strong>the minimum RAM requirements for a full GNOME 3 session has increased to 768 MB</strong>. This is a non-issue on modern hardware but can be detrimental on lower-end machines. For this reason, we have also released an official, <strong>minimal Kali 2.0 ISO</strong>. This “light” flavour of Kali includes a handful of useful tools together with the lightweight <a href="https://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> desktop environment - a perfect solution for resource-constrained computers.</p>
<h2 id="kali-linux-20-arm-images--nethunter-20">Kali Linux 2.0 ARM Images &amp; NetHunter 2.0</h2>
<p>The whole <strong>ARM</strong> image section has been updated across the board with Kali 2.0 - including Raspberry Pi, Chromebooks, Odroids… The whole lot! In the process, we’ve added some new images - such as the latest <strong>Chromebook Flip</strong> - the little beauty here on the right. Go ahead, click on the image, take a closer look. Another helpful change we’ve implemented in our ARM images is including kernel sources, for easier compilation of new drivers.</p>
<p>We haven’t forgotten about <strong>NetHunter</strong>, our favourite mobile penetration testing platform - which also got an update and now includes Kali 2.0. With this, we’ve released a whole barrage of new NetHunter images for Nexus 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. The <strong>OnePlus One</strong> NetHunter image has also been updated to Kali 2.0 and now has a much awaited <strong>image for CM12 as well</strong> - check the <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-mobile">OffSec NetHunter</a> page for more information.</p>

These include 32 and 64 bit flavours of the GNOME 3 full Kali environment.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-wheres-my-kali-20-download">TL;DR. Where’s My Kali 2.0 Download?</h2>
<p>The tl;dr of this release is best explained by comparison: If Kali 1.0 was <strong>focused on building a solid infrastructure</strong> then Kali 2.0 is <strong>focused on overhauling the user experience and maintaining updated packages and tool repositories</strong>. Along with the arrival of 2.0 comes a whole lot of interesting updates… You can head down to our <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">Kali Linux 2.0 Download</a> page to get the goodness for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="still-tl-still-dr-how-do-i-upgrade-to-kali-20">Still TL; Still DR. How Do I Upgrade to Kali 2.0?</h2>
<p>Yes, you <strong><em>can</em></strong> upgrade Kali 1.x to Kali 2.0! To do this, you will need to edit your source.list entries, and run a <strong>dist-upgrade</strong> as shown below. If you have been using incorrect or extraneous Kali repositories or otherwise manually installed or overwritten Kali packages outside of <strong>apt</strong>, your upgrade to Kali 2.0 may fail. This includes scripts like lazykali.sh, PTF, manual git clones in incorrect directories, etc. - All of these will clobber existing files on the filesystem and result in a failed upgrade. If this is the case for you, you’re better off reinstalling your OS from scratch.</p>
<p>Otherwise, feel free to:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="metasploit-community--pro-no-longer-ships-in-kali">Metasploit Community / Pro no longer ships in Kali</h2>
<p>At the request of Rapid7, we have <strong>removed the Metasploit Community / Pro package</strong> from Kali Linux and now host the Open-source <strong><em>metasploit-framework</em></strong> package only. For all of you who require Community or Pro, you will now need to <strong>download it from Rapid7</strong> and then register and submit your personal details in order to get a license. In addition, <em>the Rapid7 team no longer maintains the Metasploit package in Kali</em>, which has brought with it some substantial changes - we’ve moved to a “native” setup, where rather than bundling all the required software needed to run Metasploit in one big package, we use native dependencies within Kali to support the <strong><em>metasploit-framework</em></strong> package. This results in a <strong>faster, smoother work experience and easier integration</strong> with Metasploit dependencies. For more information about this, check out our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/tools/starting-metasploit-framework-in-kali/">Metasploit Framework in Kali</a> documentation page.</p>
<h3 id="starting-up-metasploit-framework-in-kali-linux-20">Starting up Metasploit Framework in Kali Linux 2.0</h3>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned changes in the <strong><em>metasploit-framework</em></strong> package, there are some minor changes in how Metasploit is started in Kali - specifically, there <strong>is no longer a <em>metasploit</em> service</strong>. This is how you start up the Metasploit Framework with database support in Kali Linux 2.0:</p>
