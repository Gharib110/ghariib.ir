				<p>As businesses adapt within an increasingly digital world, the need for agility, scalability and resilience has never been more critical with innovations, such as multicloud computing rapidly emerging as crucial engines to meet these demands. However, while businesses across the globe leverage the vast benefits of these applications, they face an equally rapid rise in the complexity of securing their assets, delivering unprecedented challenges in detecting and tackling threats to their cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p>According to Forrester, enterprises spend a mean of $2.4 million to find and recover data from a breach. With data stored in public clouds incurring the highest average breach cost at $5.17 million, it’s clear that companies need security solutions with the speed, intelligence and robustness that can match the innovations powering their core businesses everyday.</p>
<p>This is why we’re proud to announce an expansion of our collaboration with <strong>@SwisscomB2B</strong>, where we’ve become one of their exclusive strategic partners in their Cyber Security portfolio. With a focus on MDR (Managed Detection and Response) and CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform), we’ll be collectively strengthening their managed service offerings, further equipping businesses to anticipate new threats in the evolving digital ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="a-deeper-dive-on-the-need-for-innovation">A Deeper Dive on the Need for Innovation</h2>
<p>Due to the complexity, dynamism and scale of multicloud architectures, traditional cybersecurity tools, originally designed for static or single-cloud deployments, are struggling to keep pace. These tools were built for environments with centralized, and well-defined infrastructures, where the security perimeter was easier to define and control. However, multicloud setups fundamentally disrupt these paradigms, exposing significant limitations.</p>
<p>For example, multicloud environments involve multiple vendors, such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Each has its own unique architectures, APIs and security protocols. Traditional tools often lack the integration capabilities needed to provide unified visibility across these diverse platforms. This can result in security blind spots, where organizations may be unaware of misconfigurations, unauthorized access or potential vulnerabilities in certain parts of their infrastructure. Without end-to-end visibility, threats can easily slip through undetected, leading to major security risks.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-cloud-native-application-protection-platforms-cnapps">The Rise of Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs)</h2>
<p>However, the emergence of Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs) has represented a significant shift towards combating these issues. By consolidating tools into a unified platform, CNAPPs deliver a more cohesive solution, embedding security into the entire cloud lifecycle, ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected early during development and that robust measures are implemented throughout runtime operations.</p>
<p>With a centralized interface offering a holistic view of an organization’s cloud infrastructure, CNAPPs streamline monitoring and management deliver both efficiency and clarity. This innovative approach enables organizations to meet modern cloud security demands with confidence.</p>
<h2 id="prisma-cloud--a-leader-in-cnapp-innovation">Prisma Cloud — A Leader in CNAPP Innovation</h2>
<p>Palo Alto Networks® Prisma® Cloud typifies the CNAPPs approach, demonstrating how effective multicloud security hinges on achieving complete visibility across all deployed cloud resources. This comprehensive platform ensures that organizations can monitor and secure every facet of their cloud environments, no matter how complex or dispersed they are.</p>
<p>In recognition of its effectiveness, Frost &amp; Sullivan named Prisma Cloud the leader in their 2023 Frost Radar™ for CNAPPs, awarding Palo Alto Networks the CNAPP Company of the Year title. With its state-of-the-art code-to-cloud intelligence, Prisma Cloud simplifies the management of a variety of dynamic infrastructures, offering a centralized view across thousands of accounts, networks and devices. Its real-time vulnerability detection helps safeguard organizations against potential breaches, delivering peace of mind.</p>
<p>With Swisscom&rsquo;s comprehensive managed service offering, we are confident that our Prisma Cloud business will not only substantially increase its visibility and market share in Switzerland, but enable businesses to adopt multicloud strategies with greater confidence and security.</p>
<p>Speaking on the partnership, Cyrill Peter, Head of Cyber Security Services at Swisscom AG Switzerland, comments:</p>
<p>“Cyber attacks are on the rise, compliance regulations are constantly being tightened, hybrid IT infrastructures are becoming more complex. Increased protection, detection and transparency in multi-cloud environments are essential. We are therefore delighted to further expand our existing strong strategic partnership with Palo Alto Networks and to be able to jointly offer compelling and forward-looking cyber security services to Swiss companies and authorities.”</p>
<p>In the era of multicloud innovation, businesses require security solutions that can evolve with their ambitions. Our partnership with Swisscom delivers exactly that. With Prisma Cloud’s industry-leading capabilities and Swisscom’s managed services expertise, we’re empowering organizations to safeguard their cloud environment from vulnerabilities, delivering the freedom to do what they do best – driving growth and innovation.</p>
