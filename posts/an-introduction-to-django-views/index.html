</p>
<p>Views are central to Django’s architecture pattern, and having a solid grasp of how to work with them is essential for any developer working with the framework. If you’re new to developing web apps with Django or just need a refresher on views, we’ve got you covered. </p>
<p>Gaining a better understanding of views will help you make faster progress in your Django project. Whether you’re working on an API backend or web UI flows, knowing how to use views is crucial.</p>
<p>Read on to discover what Django views are, their different types, best practices for working with them, and examples of use cases.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-django-views">What are Django views?</h2>
<p>Views are a core component of Django’s MTV (model-template-view) architecture pattern. They essentially act as middlemen between models and templates, processing user requests and returning responses.</p>
<p>You may have come across views in the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern. However, these are slightly different from views in Django and don’t translate exactly. Django views are essentially controllers in MVC, while Django templates roughly align with views in MVC. This makes understanding the nuances of Django views vital, even if you’re familiar with views in an MVC context.</p>
<p>Views are part of the user interface in Django, and they handle the logic and data processing for web requests made to your Django-powered apps and sites. They render your templates into what the user sees when they view your webpage. Each function-based or class-based view takes a user’s request, fetches the data from its models, applies business logic or data processing, and then prepares and returns an HTTP response to a template.</p>
<p>This response can be anything a web browser can display and is typically an HTML webpage. However, Django views can also return images, XML documents, redirects, error pages, and more.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-and-passing-data-to-templates">Rendering and passing data to templates</h2>
<p>Django provides the <code>render()</code> shortcut to make template rendering simple from within views. Using <code>render()</code> helps avoid the boilerplate of loading the template and creating the response manually.</p>
<p>PyCharm offers smart code completion that automatically suggests the <code>render()</code> function from <code>django.shortcuts</code> when you start typing it in your views. It also recognizes template names and provides autocompletion for template paths, helping you avoid typos and errors.</p>
<p>The user provides the request, the template name, and a context dictionary, which gives data for the template. Once the necessary data is obtained, the view passes it to the template, where it can be rendered and presented to the user.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    # Some business logic to obtain data
    data_to_pass = {&#39;variable1&#39;: &#39;value1&#39;, &#39;variable2&#39;: &#39;value2&#39;}

    # Pass the data to the template
    return render(request, &#39;my_template.html&#39;, context=data_to_pass)
</code></pre><p>In this example, <code>data_to_pass</code> is a dictionary containing the data you want to send to the template. The <code>render</code> function is then used to render the template (<code>my_template.html</code>) with the provided context data.</p>
<p>Now, in your template (<code>my_template.html</code>), you can access and display the data.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Template&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ variable1 }}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{{ variable2 }}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>In the template, you use double curly braces (<code>{{ }}</code>) to indicate template variables. These will be replaced with the values from the context data passed by the view.</p>
<p>PyCharm offers completion and syntax highlighting for Django template tags, variables, and loops. It also provides in-editor linting for common mistakes. This allows you to focus on building views and handling logic, rather than spending time manually filling in template elements or debugging common errors.</p>

<h2 id="function-based-views">Function-based views</h2>
<p>Django has two types of views: function-based views and class-based views.</p>
<p>Function-based views are built using simple Python functions and are generally divided into four basic categories: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). This is the foundation of any framework in development. They take in an HTTP request and return an HTTP response.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.http import HttpResponse

def my_view(request):

    # View logic goes here
    context = {&#34;message&#34;: &#34;Hello world&#34;}

    return HttpResponse(render(request, &#34;mytemplate.html&#34;, context))
</code></pre><p>This snippet handles the logic of the view, prepares a context dictionary for passing data to a template that is rendered, and returns the final template HTML in a response object.</p>
<p>Function-based views are simple and straightforward. The logic is contained in a single Python function instead of spread across methods in a class, making them most suited to use cases with minimal processing.</p>
<p>PyCharm allows you to automatically generate the <code>def my_view(request)</code> structure using live templates. Live templates are pre-defined code snippets that can be expanded into boilerplate code. This feature saves you time and ensures a consistent structure for your view definitions.</p>
<p>You can invoke live templates simply by pressing <em>⌘J</em>, typing <code>Listview</code>, and pressing the tab key. </p>
<p>Moreover, PyCharm includes a <em>Django Structure</em> tool window, where you can see a list of all the views in your Django project, organized by app. This allows you to quickly locate views, navigate between them, and identify which file each view belongs to.</p>
<h2 id="class-based-views">Class-based views</h2>
<p>Django introduced class-based views so users wouldn’t need to write the same code repeatedly. They don’t replace function-based views but instead have certain applications and advantages, especially in cases where complex logic is required.</p>
<p>Class-based views in Django provide reusable parent classes that implement various patterns and functionality typically needed by web application views. You can take your views from these parent classes to reduce boilerplate code. </p>
<p>Class-based views offer generic parent classes like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ListView</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DetailView</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CreateView</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And many more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are two similar code snippets demonstrating a simple <code>BookListView.</code> The first shows a basic implementation using the default class-based conventions, while the second illustrates how you can customize the view by specifying additional parameters. </p>
<p><strong>Basic implementation</strong>: </p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Book 

class BookListView(ListView):
    model = Book
    # The template_name is omitted because Django defaults to &#39;book_list.html&#39; 
    # based on the convention of &lt;model_name&gt;_list.html for ListView.
</code></pre><p>When <code>BookListView</code> gets rendered, it automatically queries the Book records and passes them under the variable books when rendering <code>book_list.html</code>. This means you can create a view to list objects quickly without needing to rewrite the underlying logic.</p>
<p><strong>Customized implementation</strong>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Book 

class BookListView(ListView):

    model = Book
	# You can customize the view further by adding additional attributes or methods 
    def get_queryset(self):
	# Example of customizing the queryset to filter books
	return Book.objects.filter(is_available=True)
</code></pre><p>In the second snippet, we’ve introduced a custom <code>get_queryset()</code> method, allowing us to filter the records displayed in the view more precisely. This shows how class-based views can be extended beyond their default functionality to meet the needs of your application. </p>
<p>Class-based views also define methods that tie into key parts of the request and response lifecycle, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>get()</code> – logic for <code>GET</code> requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>post()</code> – logic for <code>POST</code> requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dispatch()</code> – determines which method to call <code>get()</code> or <code>post()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of views provide structure while offering customization where needed, making them well-suited to elaborate use cases.</p>
<p>PyCharm offers live templates for class-based views like <code>ListView</code>, <code>DetailView</code>, and <code>TemplateView</code>, allowing you to generate entire view classes in seconds, complete with boilerplate methods and docstrings.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="creating-custom-class-based-views">Creating custom class-based views</h3>
<p>You can also create your own view classes by subclassing Django’s generic ones and customizing them for your needs. </p>
<p>Some use cases where you might want to make your own classes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding business logic, such as complicated calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixing multiple generic parents to blend functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing sessions or state across multiple requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimizing database access with custom queries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reusing common rendering logic across different areas. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A custom class-based view could look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.views.generic import View
from django.shortcuts import render
from . import models

class ProductSalesView(View):

    def get(self, request):
     
        # Custom data processing 
        sales = get_sales_data()
        
        return render(request, &#34;sales.html&#34;, {&#34;sales&#34;: sales})

    def post(self, request):

        # Custom form handling
        form = SalesSearchForm(request.POST)  
        if form.is_valid():
            results = models.Sale.objects.filter(date__gte=form.cleaned_data[&#39;start_date&#39;])
            context = {&#34;results&#34;: results}
            return render(request, &#34;search_results.html&#34;, context)
            
        # Invalid form handling
        errors = form.errors
        return render(request, &#34;sales.html&#34;, {&#34;errors&#34;: errors})
</code></pre><p>Here, custom <code>get</code> and <code>post</code> handlers enable you to extend the existing ones between requests.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-each-view-type">When to use each view type</h2>
<p>Function-based and class-based views can both be useful depending on the complexity and needs of the view logic. </p>
<p>The main differences are that class-based views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promote reuse via subclassing and parents inheriting behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are ideal for state management between requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide more structure and enforced discipline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might use them working with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dashboard pages with complex rendering logic. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public-facing pages that display dynamic data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin portals for content management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List or detail pages involving database models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, function-based views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are simpler and take less code to create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be easier for Python developers to grasp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are highly flexible and have fewer constraints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Their use cases include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prototyping ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple CRUD or database views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing or marketing pages. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API endpoints for serving web requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, function-based views are flexible, straightforward, and are easier to reason about. However, for more complex cases, you’ll need to create more code that you can’t reuse.</p>
<p>Class-based views in Django enforce structure and are reusable, but they can be more challenging to understand and implement, as well as harder to debug.</p>
<h2 id="views-and-urls">Views and URLs</h2>
<p>As we’ve established, in Django, views are the functions or classes that determine how a template is rendered. Each view links to a specific URL pattern, guiding incoming requests to the right place.</p>
<p>Understanding the relationship between views and URLs is important for managing your application’s flow effectively. </p>
<p>Every view corresponds with a URL pattern defined in your Django app’s <code>urls.py</code> file. This URL mapping ensures that when a user navigates to a specific address in your application, Django knows exactly which view to invoke. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a simple URL configuration: </p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.urls import path
from .views import BookListView

urlpatterns = [
    path(&#39;books/&#39;, BookListView.as_view(), name=&#39;book-list&#39;),
]
</code></pre><p>In this setup, when a user visits <code>/books/</code>, the <code>BookListView</code> kicks in to render the list of books. By clearly mapping URLs to views, you make your codebase easier to read and more organized.</p>
<h3 id="simplify-url-management-with-pycharm">Simplify URL management with PyCharm</h3>
<p>Managing and visualizing endpoints in Django can become challenging as your application grows. PyCharm addresses this with its <em>Endpoints</em> tool window, which provides a centralized view of all your app’s URL patterns, linked views, and HTTP methods. This feature allows you to see a list of every endpoint in your project, making it easier to track which views are tied to specific URLs. </p>
<p>Instead of searching through multiple <code>urls.py</code> files, you can instantly locate and navigate to the corresponding views with just a click. This is especially useful for larger Django projects where URL configurations span multiple files or when working in teams where establishing context quickly is crucial.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <em>Endpoints</em> tool window lets you visualize all endpoints in a table-like interface. Each row displays the URL path, the HTTP method (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, etc.), and the associated view function or class of a given endpoint. </p>
<p>This feature not only boosts productivity but also improves code navigation, allowing you to spot missing or duplicated URL patterns with ease. This level of visibility is invaluable for debugging routing issues or onboarding new developers to a project.</p>
<p>Check out this video for more information on the <em>Endpoints</em> tool window and how you can benefit from it. </p>

<h2 id="best-practices-for-using-django-views">Best practices for using Django views</h2>
<p>Here are some guidelines that can help you create well-structured and maintainable views.</p>
<h3 id="keep-views-focused">Keep views focused</h3>
<p>Views should concentrate on handling requests, fetching data, passing data to templates, and controlling flow and redirects. Complicated business logic and complex processing should happen elsewhere, such as in model methods or dedicated service classes. </p>
<p>However, you should be mindful not to overload your models with too much logic, as this can lead to the “fat model” anti-pattern in Django. Django’s documentation on views provides more insights about structuring them properly. </p>
<h3 id="keep-views-and-templates-thin">Keep views and templates thin</h3>
<p>It’s best to keep both views and templates slim. Views should handle request processing and data retrieval, while templates should focus on presentation with minimal logic.</p>
<p>Complex processing should be done in Python outside the templates to improve maintainability and testing. For more on this, check out the Django templates documentation.</p>
<h3 id="decouple-database-queries">Decouple database queries</h3>
<p>Extracting database queries into separate model managers or repositories instead of placing them directly in views can help reduce duplication. Refer to the Django models documentation for guidance on managing database interactions effectively. </p>
<h3 id="use-generic-class-based-views-when-possible">Use generic class-based views when possible</h3>
<p>Django’s generic class-based views, like <code>DetailView</code> and <code>ListView</code>, provide reusability without requiring you to write much code. Opt for using them over reinventing the wheel to make better use of your time. The generic views documentation is an excellent resource for understanding these features. </p>
<h3 id="function-based-views-are-ok-for-simple-cases">Function-based views are OK for simple cases</h3>
<p>For basic views like serving APIs, a function can be more effective than a class. Reserve complex class-based views for intricate UI flows. The writing views documentation page offers helpful examples.</p>
<h3 id="structure-routes-and-urls-cleanly">Structure routes and URLs cleanly</h3>
<p>Organize routes and view handlers by grouping them into apps by functionality. This makes it easier to find and navigate the source. Check out the Django URL dispatcher documentation for best practices in structuring your URL configurations. </p>
