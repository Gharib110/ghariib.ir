				<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that GPU Droplets join the suite of DigitalOcean’s Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II compliant products. With this achievement, customers can experiment, train, and scale AI projects on GPU Droplets with trust in DigitalOcean’s ongoing commitment to protect customers’ sensitive information.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Adhering to SOC 2 remains a critical part of DigitalOcean’s operations given our commitment to security and simplicity. This means that when you build on DigitalOcean, you build on a foundation of proven security practices and controls. As an example, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Based on the cloud product in use, customers inherit a portion of DigitalOcean’s security posture under the Shared Responsibility Model. By using a SOC 2 compliant product, customers can be more confident that they can manage their risk footprint to the requirements of that standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Many regulatory regimes have overlapping compliance requirements as the SOC 2, therefore helping you further enhance your own compliance objectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-soc-2-compliance">What is SOC 2 Compliance?</h2>
<p>SOC 2 is one of three SOC standards (SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3) developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) which assess an organization’s controls against the applicable Trust Services Criteria, which include some combination of the following: Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. For a deep dive into SOC 2 compliance, please see this article on The Wave.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-the-report">Accessing the Report</h3>
<p>The SOC 3 Type II report summarizes our SOC 2 Type II report and is readily available for public review. Our comprehensive SOC 2 Type II report can be accessed through our Security Reports &amp; Certification Center.</p>
<h2 id="get-started-with-gpu-droplets">Get Started with GPU Droplets</h2>
