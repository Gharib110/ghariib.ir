<p>The new year has arrived, and we’re kicking it off with another handpicked selection of must-read tutorials and the latest news you won’t want to miss. This issue starts with an amazing featured content section with Donald Raab. Settle in and scroll your way to some fresh knowledge!</p>

</p>
<p>Donald Raab has over 23 years of experience as a Software Engineer in the financial services industry. He started programming with Java in 1997. Don is a member of the JSR 335 Expert Group (Libraries) and is also the creator of the Eclipse Collections open-source Java Library. Donald was selected as a 2018 Java Champion, and he is a frequent speaker and guest trainer at key Java conferences and user group meetups.</p>
<p>Greetings, Java Annotated Monthly readers! It’s an honor to be invited to write the featured content section this month! I’ve been reading the Java Annotated Monthly newsletter for the past decade. It is an amazing resource for the Java community. As an author of Java related content, I find it incredibly gratifying every time something I write is included in this newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>Writing about writing</strong></p>
<p>I spent most of 2024 writing a book and writing blogs. I wrote an average of four blogs per month this year. One of my recent technical blogs is Poetry in Code. This is a crossover blog which blends poetry, Java code, and blogging. To see how I can effortlessly switch from poetry to parkour, there is Parkour with Maps in Java. Queue “The Office” parkour meme.</p>
<p><strong>Writing content in AsciiDoc</strong></p>
<p>I’m writing the content for this feature in AsciiDoc using IntelliJ IDEA. I’ve spent most of 2024 writing a book about Eclipse Collections in AsciiDoc. The AsciiDoc plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is absolutely wonderful! I have used AsciiDoc to write READMEs, reference guide documentation, conference slide decks, and several tables for Medium blogs that are stored in GitHub gists.</p>
<p>The open-source developers who work on AsciiDoc, Asciidoctor, AsciidoctorJ, JRuby, and IntelliJ IDEA have created tools that work great together and are a pleasure to author and publish content with. Thank you!</p>
<p>I found a lot of useful information from this blog from Trisha Gee that I discovered near the beginning of my book journey. I also discovered this article from vogella which has some consolidated and useful advice and examples for writing documentation in AsciiDoc.</p>
<p><strong>JavaOne 2025</strong></p>
<p>I’m excited to be giving a talk at JavaOne 2025 on DataFrames in Java with my long time friend Vlad Zakharov. Vlad is the creator of an open-source DataFrame library for Java named DataFrame-EC, which is built on top of Eclipse Collections. Vlad has an interesting blog about Java, Kotlin, and Pandas Data Frames and the One Billion Row Challenge. I hope to meet some new Java devs and catch up with friends at JavaOne next year. If you want to speak at conferences, this blog from Holly Cummins is a great resource to learn from.</p>
<p><strong>Java 24</strong></p>
<p>I’m excited for Java 24 to be released in March 2025, and for it to include experimental support for Compact Object Headers (JEP 450). Peter Lawrey wrote a very interesting blog titled Demystifying Java Object Sizes: Compact Headers, Compressed Oops, and Beyond. I am curious to see how Compact Object Headers impact Eclipse Collections types.</p>
<p><strong>JCP EC Working Groups</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a useful link to keep up to date with the two active workgroups on the JCP Executive Committee. The wikis for the workgroups have many useful presentations, links, and other resources. JEP 14 is an interesting recent development we’ve been discussing in the Java Ecosystem WG.</p>
<p><strong>Do something that scares you, every single day</strong></p>
<p>I broke through my fear of being on a podcast in 2024, twice! If you’d like to know more about things I have been up to in open source, the Java community, Eclipse Collections, and my book, there’s a recent audio-only version of a Duke’s Corner podcast titled “Unlimited, Untapped Resources”, I gave with Jim Grisanzio. If you listen to the podcast, you can find out the title of my book. Be sure to check out the other Duke’s Corner podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>Kudos to the writers</strong></p>
<p>I want to thank the amazing writers at JetBrains who have read, explained, and linked to valuable Java related content over the past decade plus at the Java Annotated Monthly archive. I appreciate the time and effort that has been consistently invested in finding and linking to amazing Java content every month! FOR OVER A DECADE!!! This newsletter has helped me discover so many interesting articles and blogs I otherwise would not have had the time to discover on my own.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to all the content producers and open source contributors out there who make being a Java developer an amazing experience! Have fun coding and writing out there!</p>
