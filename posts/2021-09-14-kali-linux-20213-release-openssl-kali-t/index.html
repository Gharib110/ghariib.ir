<h2 id="openssl-wide-compatibility-by-default">OpenSSL: wide compatibility by default</h2>
<p>Going forwards from Kali Linux 2021.3, OpenSSL has now been configured for <strong>wider compatibility</strong> to allow Kali to talk to as many services as possible. This means that legacy protocols <em>(such as TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1)</em> and older ciphers are <strong>enabled by default</strong>. This is done to help increase Kali’s ability to talk to older, obsolete systems and servers that are still using these older protocols. This may potentially increase your options on available attack surfaces <em>(if your target has these End of Life (EoL) services running, having then forgotten about them, what else could this uncover?)</em>. While this is not a configuration that would be good for a general purpose operating systems, this setting makes sense for Kali as it enables the user to engage and talk with more potential targets.</p>
<p>This setting is easy to modify via the command-line tool <code>kali-tweaks</code> though. Enter the <em>Hardening</em> section, and from there you can configure OpenSSL for <strong>Strong Security</strong> mode instead, which uses today’s current modern standard allowing for secure communication.</p>
<p>For more details, refer to the documentation: <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/openssl-configuration/">kali.org/docs/general-use/openssl-configuration/</a></p>
<h2 id="kali-tools">Kali-Tools</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">2019.4</a> we moved our documentation over to our updated <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">/docs/</a> page. It’s now finally the turn of our <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali-Tools</a> site!</p>
<p>We have refreshed every aspect of the previous site, giving a new, faster, layout, content, and system! The backend is now in a semi-automated state and more in the open, which like before, allows for anyone to help out and <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">contribute</a>.</p>
<p>Once these sites have settled down from all the changes and matured a bit, we will start to package these both up, allowing for offline reading.</p>

<h2 id="virtualization-improvements-all-over-the-place">Virtualization: improvements all over the place</h2>
<p>The Kali Live image received some love during this release cycle! We worked hard to make the experience smoother for those who run the Live image in <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/">virtualized environments</a>. Basic features like <strong>copy’n’paste</strong> and <strong>drag’n’drop</strong> between the host and the guest should now work out of the box. And this is really for everyone: VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V and QEMU+Spice. Did we forget anyone? Drop us a word on the <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">Kali bug tracker</a>!</p>
<p>On the same line: it’s now very easy to configure Kali for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/use-local-resources-on-hyper-v-virtual-machine-with-vmconnect"><strong>Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode</strong></a>. Open <code>kali-tweaks</code> in a terminal, select <code>Virtualization</code>, and if Kali is running under Hyper-V, you’ll see a setting to turn on Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode. It’s now as simple as hitting Enter!</p>
<p>If you use this feature, make sure to visit <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-hyper-v-guest-enhanced-session-mode/">kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-hyper-v-guest-enhanced-session-mode/</a>, as there are a few additional things to be aware of.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/jetbennett">Shane Bennett</a>, who spent a tremendous amount of time testing this feature, provided extremely detailed feedback all along, and even helped us with the documentation. Kudos Shane!</p>
<h2 id="new-tools-in-kali">New Tools in Kali</h2>

<h3 id="kali-nethunter-watch">Kali NetHunter Watch</h3>
<p>We proudly introduce the world’s <strong>first Kali NetHunter smartwatch, the TicHunter Pro</strong> thanks to the outstanding work of our very own NetHunter developer <a href="https://gitlab.com/yesimxev">yesimxev</a>. It is still experimental, hence the features are limited to USB attacks, and some basic functions. The hardware also has limitations, as such a small battery won’t supply enough voltage for any OTG adapters, so huge antennas won’t stick out of your wrist! The future is very promising, bringing support for Nexmon and internal bluetooth usage.</p>
<p>The image is available on our <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download page</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that those images contain a “nano Kali rootfs” due to technical reasons. The detailed installation guide can be found in our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-ticwatch-pro/">Kali documentation</a>. Feel free to join the adventure!</p>
<h3 id="kali-nethunter-installation-via-magisk">Kali NetHunter Installation via Magisk</h3>
<p>Thanks to the amazing work of <a href="https://twitter.com/Mominul00650279">Mominul Islam</a>, we can now bring <strong>Kali NetHunter to Android 11 devices without a fully working TWRP</strong>!</p>
<p>Each Kali NetHunter image can be flashed as a Magisk module. This work is still in its infancy and more work is needed to bring it up to par with the traditional installer through TWRP.</p>
<p>One of the missing parts is the kernel installation. We haven’t been able to install the kernel through Magisk yet. That has to be done via kernel installers like the “Franco Kernel Manager”. If you are keen to get NetHunter onto your Android 11 device, just give it a crack. If you are interested in helping out with getting the kernel part finished, please get in touch with us through our <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-project/-/issues">GitLab issue tracker</a>. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Our <strong>preferred device for Kali NetHunter is the OnePlus 7 running Android 10 (stock ROM)</strong>.</p>
<p>For a step-by-step installation guide and links to all the files required to restore your phone to the latest stock Android 10 ROM, install TWRP, Magisk and Kali NetHunter, head over to our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-oneplus-7/">Kali documentation</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="kali-arm-updates">Kali ARM Updates</h2>
<p>We have been busy doing various tweaks and tinkering on our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/">Kali ARM images</a>, which covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Kali ARM build-scripts</a> have been re-worked</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/cyrus104">cyrus104</a>, we now have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/main/gateworks-newport.sh">build-script to support the <strong>Gateworks Newport</strong></a> board, and he also added <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/gateworks-newport/">documentation</a> for it.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/re4sonkernel">Re4son</a> contributed a <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/main/rpi0w-pitail.sh">build-script</a> for the Raspberry Pi Zero W based <strong><a href="https://whitedome.com.au/re4son/pi-tail/">“Pi-Tail”</a></strong> <em>(Find <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-zero-w-pi-tail/">more information here</a>)</em>.</li>
<li>Additionally, the RaspberryPi Zero W based <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/main/rpi0w-nexmon-p4wnp1-aloa.sh"><strong>“P4wnP1”</strong> build-script</a> has undergone some major changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All images <em>should</em> finally <strong>resize the file-system on the first boot</strong>.</li>
<li>We now <strong>re-generate the default snakeoil cert</strong>, which fixes a couple of tools that were failing to run previously.</li>
<li>Images default to <code>iptables-legacy</code> and <code>ip6tables-legacy</code> for <strong>iptables support</strong>.</li>
<li>We now <strong>set a default locale</strong> of <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> on all images, you can, of course, change this to your preferred locale.</li>
<li>The <strong>Kali user</strong> on ARM images is now in all of the <strong>same groups</strong> as base images by default, and uses <strong>zsh</strong> for the default shell. You can change your default shell by using the <code>kali-tweaks</code> tool which also comes pre-installed.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi images can <strong>now use a <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> file on the <code>/boot</code> partition</strong>.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi images <strong>now come with <code>kalipi-config</code>, and <code>kalipi-tft-config</code></strong> pre-installed.</li>
<li><strong>Pinebook Pro’s kernel</strong> has been updated to <strong>5.14</strong>, and you now get <strong>messages on the LCD screen as it’s booting</strong>, instead of a blinking cursor until X starts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="desktop--theme-updates">Desktop &amp; Theme Updates</h2>
<p>There are also some changes in the desktop space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved GTK3 theme for Xfce’s notifications and logout-dialog</li>
<li>Redesigned GTK2 theme for a better fit of older programs</li>
<li>Improved Kali-Dark and Kali-Light syntax-highlighting themes for GNOME and Xfce</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these changes, one of Kali’s preferred desktops, KDE plasma, has received a version bump, now including version <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.21.0/">5.21</a>. This update brings an updated look, with a new application launcher and theme improvements. Here’s a preview of how it looks with Kali’s customization:</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="upcoming-changes">Upcoming Changes</h2>
<p>Looking forward, we are going to be announcing the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kali-Menu refresh</strong> - We know you may not use it, but for the people who do, we are planning on making some major alterations in its structure. This will hopefully be <strong>live for testing in 2021.4</strong>, and then made default in a later release based on user response. You will be able to change the menu layout by using <code>kali-tweaks</code>. If you want to provide input on this change, get engaged with us and make your voice heard!</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancer</strong> (http.kali.org &amp; cdimage.kali.org) - This handles apt packages as well as OS images. We will be switching from MirrorBrain to MirrorBits. We will be soon in touch with all the community mirror maintainers to give them notice of our infrastructure changes. If you would like to become a mirror, please see <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/setting-up-a-kali-linux-mirror/">our guide</a>.</li>

<h2 id="download-kali-linux-20213">Download Kali Linux 2021.3</h2>
<p><strong>Fresh Images</strong>: So what are you waiting for? Start <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">downloading</a> already!</p>
<p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the those who are not, we do also produce <strong><a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds</a></strong> that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages <em>(or bug fixes)</em> when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead. This way you’ll have fewer updates to do. <em>Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard <a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release images</a></em>. But we gladly take <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug reports</a> about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release!</p>
<p><strong>Existing Installs</strong>: If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update</a>:</p>
