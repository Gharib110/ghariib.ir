				<p>At DigitalOcean, we embrace the ever-changing nature of the tech landscape, and our data centers are no exception. The reopening of NYC2 demonstrates our commitment to growth, innovation, and supporting our customers as they scale.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to announce that NYC2, originally launched in 2013, is once again open to new customers! As one of our first data centers, it has been a crucial part of DigitalOcean’s infrastructure, supporting countless developers and businesses over the years. After temporarily closing to new customers due to capacity constraints, we have now expanded and upgraded our facility, enabling us to bring NYC2 back online with enhanced offerings.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-at-nyc2">What’s New at NYC2?</h2>
<p>Our decision to reopen NYC2 was driven by growth and innovation. We’ve expanded to provide additional space and added new GPUs to power the next generation of AI/ML businesses. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Capacity</strong>: With more room to grow, we’ve ensured that NYC2 is ready to support more customers, applications, and workloads than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</strong>: The reopening coincides with the launch of GPUs at NYC2, providing powerful, high-performance computing options for our customers. GPU Droplets are powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which feature 640 Tensor Cores and 128 RT Cores, facilitating high-speed data processing. GPU Droplets offer on-demand access, helping developers, startups, and innovators train AI models, process large datasets, and handle complex neural networks with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Fluidity and Flexibility</strong>: DigitalOcean’s 16 data centers are designed to be as adaptable as the businesses we serve. Whether you’re a startup deploying your first application or an enterprise scaling up to meet demand, NYC2’s updated infrastructure provides the flexibility you need.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>We’re thrilled to welcome new customers back to NYC2, but this is just the beginning. While not all of our products are yet available at this location, the expanded capacity opens up possibilities for future enhancements in 2025.</p>
