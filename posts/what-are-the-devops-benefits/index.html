<p>DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) practices aimed at shortening the software development lifecycle and improving the quality of software delivery. By focusing on automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, DevOps enhances an organization’s ability to develop, test, and release software quickly and reliably.</p>
<p>The benefits of adopting DevOps practices are vast and can greatly impact the efficiency, reliability, and quality of software development and IT operations. This post will delve into the key benefits of DevOps and how each benefit contributes to organizational success.</p>
