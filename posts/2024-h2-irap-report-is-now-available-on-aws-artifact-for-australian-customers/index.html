			<h1>2024 H2 IRAP report is now available on AWS Artifact for Australian customers</h1>

				<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is excited to announce that a new Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) report (2024 H2) is now available through AWS Artifact. An independent Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) certified IRAP assessor completed the IRAP assessment of AWS in February 2025.</p>
<p>The new IRAP report includes an additional six AWS services that are now assessed at the PROTECTED level under IRAP. This brings the total number of services assessed at the PROTECTED level to 164.</p>
<p>The following are the six newly assessed services:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS CodeConnections</li>
<li>AWS HealthLake</li>
<li>Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</li>
<li>Amazon Managed Grafana</li>
<li>Amazon Verified Permissions</li>
<li>Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser</li>
</ul>
<p>For the full list of services, see the IRAP tab on the AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program page.</p>
<p>AWS has developed an IRAP documentation pack to help Australian customers and their partners plan, architect, and assess risk for their workloads when they use AWS Cloud services.</p>
<p>We developed this pack in accordance with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Cloud Security Guidance and Cloud Assessment and Authorisation framework, which addresses guidance within the Australian Government’s Information Security Manual (ISM, September 2024 version), the Department of Home Affairs’ Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), and the Digital Transformation Agency’s Secure Cloud Strategy.</p>
<p>The IRAP pack on AWS Artifact also includes newly updated versions of the AWS Consumer Guide and the whitepaper Reference Architectures for ISM PROTECTED Workloads in the AWS Cloud.</p>
<p>Reach out to your AWS representatives to let us know which additional services you would like to see in scope for upcoming IRAP assessments. We strive to bring more services into scope at the PROTECTED level under IRAP to support your requirements.</p>
