<p>At JetBrains, we aim to enable and scale the next generation of technologies to make software development a more productive and enjoyable experience. To empower and support developers, we build a variety of products for professional development, including powerful AI tools and features that have already enhanced productivity and opened new horizons for creativity. But can we go beyond that and boost productivity even further – improve code quality, unlock future innovations, help execute complex tasks, and change the way you work with code? </p>
<p>Yes, we can!</p>
<p>With the launch of Junie, JetBrains AI coding agent, we are redefining how we code by leveraging its agentic power for co-creation right in your IDE. With Junie, you can fully delegate routine tasks to your very own personal coding agent or collaborate with it to execute more complex ones together. Thanks to the power of JetBrains IDEs, coupled with reliable LLMs, Junie already solves tasks that would otherwise require hours of work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>According to SWEBench Verified, a curated benchmark of 500 developer tasks, Junie can solve 53.6% of tasks on a single run. Such a success rate is promising – this shows the potential to also adapt Junie to the reality of today’s software development, including large amounts of tasks of different complexity. Junie will unlock the power of coding agents for millions of developers and companies around the world.</p>

<h1 id="redefining-the-developer-experience-with-junie">Redefining the developer experience with Junie </h1>
<p><strong>Delivering Junie into your familiar IDEs</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure that partnering with Junie does not disrupt your coding experience, but empowers you to create and do more. Getting started with Junie is as simple as installing it into your IDE. You can then begin with delegating simple tasks as you get used to working with the coding agent, so you don’t need to make changes to your workflow.</p>
<p>And when you are comfortable with working with Junie, you can have it handle more complex tasks, integrate it into your team workflow and start redefining tasks, to boost productivity, unleash your ingenuity and creativity, and get the most from your coding experience powered by agentic AI.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Stay in control of your code</strong></p>
<p>Developers must be able to quickly review proposed changes, maintain project context, and guide critical decisions. With Junie, you stay in control, even when delegating tasks and you are always able to review code changes and how the agent executes commands. </p>
<p><strong>Delivering improved code quality</strong></p>
<p>AI-generated code can be just as flawed as developer-written code. Ultimately, Junie will not just speed up development – it is poised to raise the bar for code quality. By combining the power of JetBrains IDEs with LLMs, Junie can generate code, run inspections, write tests and verify they have passed. </p>
<p><strong>Making Junie a trusted teammate</strong></p>
<p>Junie is designed to understand the context of any given project, so it can adapt to your coding style. Junie can also follow specific coding guidelines, additionally enhancing its ability to align with the way you code. This results in better code quality and control on how Junie performs tasks, ensuring reliability, making Junie a trusted collaborator on your team.</p>
<h1 id="lets-build-a-new-way-of-coding-together">Let’s build a new way of coding, together</h1>
<p>At JetBrains, we build products together with users, listening to the feedback to drive innovation in software development. This approach helps us create products empowering millions of developers to make anything happen – with code. </p>
<p>We’ve now opened the <strong>Early Access Program waitlist</strong>. We invite you to try Junie and share your thoughts, feedback, and ideas.</p>
<p>Junie is currently available in the following JetBrains IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Professional. WebStorm is coming next. OS X and Linux platforms are supported. </p>
<p>Join the waitlist to try it in JetBrains IDEs</p>
