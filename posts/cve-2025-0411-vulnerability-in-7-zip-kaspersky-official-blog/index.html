				<p>A vulnerability CVE-2025-0411 in the 7-Zip file archiver allows bypassing the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) mechanism.</p>
<p>The vulnerability CVE-2025-0411 has been discovered in the popular 7-Zip file archiver software, allowing attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism. CVE-2025-0411 has a 7.0 CVSS rating. The vulnerability was quickly fixed, but since the program doesn’t have an automatic update mechanism, some users may still have a vulnerable version. That’s why we recommend immediately updating the archiver.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-mark-of-the-web">What is Mark-of-the-Web?</h2>
<p>The Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) mechanism involves placing a special metadata mark on files obtained from the internet. If such a mark is present, the Windows operating system considers such a file to be potentially dangerous. If the file is executable, the user sees a warning that it can cause harm when trying to execute it. Also, some programs limit the functionality of a file with this mark (for example, MS Office applications block the execution of macros in them). When an archive is downloaded from the internet, when it is unpacked, all the files should inherit this Mark-of-the-Web.</p>
<p>Malefactors have repeatedly been trying to get rid of the MOTW in order to mislead the user. In particular, several years ago we wrote that the BlueNoroff APT group had adopted methods to bypass this mechanism. According to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix classification, bypassing the MOTW mechanism belongs to sub-technique T1553.005: Subvert Trust Controls: Mark-of-the-Web Bypass.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-cve-2025-0411-vulnerability-and-how-is-it-dangerous">What is the CVE-2025-0411 vulnerability, and how is it dangerous?</h2>
<p>CVE-2025-0411 allows attackers to create an archive in such a way that when it’s unpacked by 7-Zip, the files won’t inherit the MOTW mark. As a result, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to launch malicious code with user privileges. Of course, such a vulnerability is dangerous not in and of itself, but as part of a complex attack. In addition, to exploit it, the user must launch a malicious file manually. However, as we’ve already mentioned above, attackers often try to remove this mark, so giving them an extra way to do this is clearly a big no-no.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered CVE-2025-0411 back in November last year, and immediately reported it to the author of 7-Zip. This is why version 24.09, published on November 29, 2024, is no longer vulnerable.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-stay-safe">How to stay safe</h2>
<p>First of all, you should update 7-Zip to version 24.09 or newer. If this file archiver is used in your organization, we recommend updating it centrally (if there are appropriate tools), or at least notifying that it needs urgently updating. Kaspersky products for home users can check a number of widely used software products (including 7-Zip) and update them automatically.</p>
<p>In addition, we recommend all internet users to handle files received from the internet with exceptional caution, and not to open them on computers without a reliable security solution.</p>
