<p>As your city adopts Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to enhance mobility and safety, securing these interconnected networks is more critical than ever. The distributed nature of ITS networks, IT-OT convergence, limited physical security controls, and vulnerabilities in interconnected IoT devices can pose significant challenges. When physical and operational systems converge, the risks grow – cyberattacks can have real-world consequences.</p>
<p>If you manage transportation systems, you face fragmented tools and siloed approaches among government agencies, private operators and vendors. This lack of coordination complicates the protection of real-time critical operations. Meanwhile, railroads and public transit remain prime targets for operational disruption, financial harm and geopolitical agendas, with nearly a third of threats coming from insiders.</p>
<p>Modern transportation networks must address three pivotal security questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you have comprehensive visibility into devices on your ITS network to safeguard critical infrastructure?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are you inspecting and securing edge traffic between field cabinets and data centers?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can you quickly detect, respond to and recover from edge security incidents while ensuring system resilience?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To help safeguard your systems and our nation’s critical infrastructure, security must be a priority, not an afterthought. With robust access controls and a unified strategy, you can meet these challenges head-on. Alignment with regulatory requirements and with industry standards, like ISA/IEC-62443 and NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 is essential. By achieving visibility, securing edge traffic, and building resilience, you can help protect your ITS network and the communities that depend on it.</p>
<h2 id="securing-the-future-of-transportation-with-integrated-itot-cybersecurity">Securing the Future of Transportation with Integrated IT/OT Cybersecurity</h2>

<h2 id="customer-success-spotlight--securing-transportation-networks-in-action">Customer Success Spotlight — Securing Transportation Networks in Action</h2>
<p>A State DOT faced critical security challenges while modernizing its roadway infrastructure, spanning thousands of connected field cabinets across the state. Their existing solutions relied on fragmented tools, lacked robust security and required multiple management systems – creating inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. To secure their growing ITS network, the DOT turned to Palo Alto Networks for a unified, streamlined solution.</p>
<p>Key Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieving visibility into thousands of connected devices, including traffic signals and roadside sensors.</li>
<li>Securing edge traffic between field cabinets and the central data center.</li>
<li>Enhancing incident response capabilities to reduce operational risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Palo Alto Networks Security Platform delivered a tailored solution that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive IoT/OT Device Visibility Over 5G</strong> – Leveraging AI-driven tools, the DOT achieved 100% visibility into its connected devices, ensuring rogue or unprotected assets could be identified and secured.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Edge Traffic Management</strong> – Our ruggedized NGFWs with 5G connectivity safeguarded communications between field cabinets and the central system, ensuring encrypted, tamper-proof data flows.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Incident Detection and Recovery</strong> – By deploying an integrated SOC solution, the state DOT reduced response times and implemented automated remediation workflows for potential breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>This partnership not only secured the DOT’s ITS infrastructure but also enhanced operational efficiency, demonstrating the value of integrated IT/OT cybersecurity.</p>
<h2 id="proactive-security-for-a-complex-threat-landscape">Proactive Security for a Complex Threat Landscape</h2>
<p>By ensuring real-time traffic inspection, AI-driven security and comprehensive incident response, DOT agencies can enable Zero Trust security to achieve resilience and reliability across their ITS infrastructure. As the backbone of our smart cities, transportation systems deserve a cybersecurity approach that evolves with the threats they face. With Palo Alto Networks, safeguarding ITS infrastructure isn&rsquo;t just possible, it&rsquo;s seamless.</p>
