				<p>With the rise of online scams and privacy risks, virtual private networks (VPNs) are becoming more popular for day-to-day use. Or at least I feel like they are based on the number of ads I hear for them on my favorite podcasts.</p>
<p>So maybe you’ve heard of VPNs but aren’t actually sure what they are. Simply put, a VPN creates a safe, anonymous pathway for the data you send and receive over a Wi-Fi network, allowing you to browse anonymously and access content as if you were in a different location.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve used VPNs as a remote worker to access resources and applications for your job, or as a student to connect to your university network. Do you really need a VPN for personal use? The short answer—absolutely! Keep reading for the long answer and for tips on choosing the right VPN.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-vpns-work">How do VPNs work?</h2>
<p>Essentially, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your data. The five core components of a VPN are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> The conversion of information into a coded format that can only be read by someone who has the decryption key. It ensures that data remains secure and private during transmission or storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN servers:</strong> Usually located all over the world, VPN servers act as intermediaries between your device and the internet and maintain your privacy by masking your IP address and location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kill switch:</strong> Blocks your device’s internet access if the VPN connection drops. This way, the VPN app makes sure you’re always protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Split tunneling:</strong> Allows you to choose which internet traffic goes through the VPN (with encryption) and which goes directly to the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN protocols:</strong> Transmits your data according to protocols like OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard. Each cover different use cases like streaming or gaming or are required for certain types of devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-use-a-vpn">Why use a VPN?</h2>
<p>Maybe you already have other personal cybersecurity tools for personal user and think you don’t need a VPN. Consider the following and see if you still feel that way:</p>
<p><strong>Privacy protection</strong></p>
<p>Because a VPN creates a secure tunnel for your data, you don’t have to worry about bad actors peeping in on your activity and private information. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi at coffee shops, airports, malls or hotels, where hackers can easily overcome public Wi-Fi security protocols to gain access to your device.</p>
<p><strong>Antivirus augmentation</strong></p>
<p>Even if you already have antivirus software, using a VPN enhances your personal cybersecurity.<br>
Personal privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Antivirus software:</strong> Primarily protects your device from malware, viruses, and other malicious software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN:</strong> Encrypts your internet connection, hiding your online activities from ISPs, hackers, and even government surveillance. Keeps your browsing history and personal data private and anonymous.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secure public Wi-Fi use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Antivirus software:</strong> Can detect and block malicious files or websites, but it doesn’t secure your internet connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN:</strong> Protects your data on public Wi-Fi networks, which are often unsecured and a hotspot for hackers. A VPN encrypts your connection, making it much harder for anyone to intercept your data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessing restricted content</strong></p>
<p>I have a friend who loves British television but can’t always access it due to living in America. So she uses a VPN to set the United Kingdom as her virtual location and then watches all the BBC murder mysteries she wants.</p>
<p>This capability is extremely useful if you’re someone who travels a lot. For example, if you find yourself in a country with strict censorship laws, a VPN can help you access your usual content—even if it is restricted.</p>
<h2 id="which-vpn-should-you-choose">Which VPN should you choose?</h2>
<p>Consider the following when researching VPNs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connection speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlimited data and bandwidth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number and location of servers across the globe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No-log policy*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security features and protocols</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ease of use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brand reputation and customer support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While some VPNs may be free, they often come with limited performance, data caps, and lower security and log standards.</p>
<h2 id="what-steps-should-you-take-next">What steps should you take next?</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity is only going to get more important as technology—and cyberthreats—advance. To protect your private, sensitive data, you’ll need all the tools at your disposal to keep out criminals. Add a VPN such as Webroot

 Secure VPN to your arsenal of cybersecurity tools to browse the internet safely and privately.</p>
<p><em>*A no-log policy means that the provider doesn’t keep any records of your online activities, ensuring your privacy and anonymity. This policy protects you from tracking, reduces the risk of data breaches, and prevents third-party access to your information. It also builds trust and gives you peace of mind, knowing your online activities are not being recorded or shared.</em></p>
