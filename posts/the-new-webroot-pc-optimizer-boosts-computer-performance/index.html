				<p>Think back to when your brand new laptop or desktop ran the smoothest, operating at peak performance. Is it still that fast, or does even the simplest task seem to take forever? Before you ditch your current PC, there’s a way to get it running like new again.</p>
<p>First things first, though—you have to understand why your PC is running slowly.</p>
<h2 id="do-computers-slow-down-with-age">Do computers slow down with age?</h2>
<p>If you’ve had your PC for a while, you might think it’s running slower because of aging hardware. But not even brand-new computers run at their optimal speed due to preinstalled bloatware.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-bloatware">What is bloatware?</h2>
<p>Any application or software you don’t install on your device is bloatware. For example, the last laptop I got had an antivirus software trial preinstalled—not necessarily a bad thing, but still bloatware. Maybe you have a MacBook that has creative applications like GarageBand preinstalled. That’s bloatware too.<br>
Bloatware isn’t always preinstalled. Some applications you download may include adware or utilities that slow down your PC.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-my-pc-to-run-faster">How do I get my PC to run faster?</h2>
<p>The tricky part about optimizing your PC is that the things that slow it down can be difficult to pinpoint. Maybe you’ve deleted all your unwanted and unused apps and data, but your computer is still running slowly. If this is the case, you need a PC optimization tool .</p>
<h2 id="how-does-pc-optimization-improve-performance">How does PC optimization improve performance?</h2>
<p>With PC optimization software, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Declutter your PC of junk files, unnecessary programs, and temporary files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove unneeded background processes and programs to improve speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free up bandwidth to browse and stream faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-it-important-to-optimize-your-pc">Why is it important to optimize your PC?</h2>
<p>It can be tempting to give up on your current PC and just go buy a new one. But consider sustainability issues, your budget, or even the hassle of transferring all your data to a new PC and spending time configuring it. If other parts of your hardware work perfectly—the screen, keyboard, speakers, battery, and so on—it’s worth optimizing and keeping your current hardware.</p>
<p>From a day-to-day perspective, your PC helps you create or enjoy videos, music, photos, documents, and much more to unleash your creativity, plan your life, and run your business. You need it operating at its full power and performance to handle demanding apps like video editing or 3D gaming.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-pc-optimization-software-should-you-get">What kind of PC optimization software should you get?</h2>
<p>Look for these five features when researching PC optimization tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Registry tuner</strong>: Cleans up the repository that contains massive amount of data about your PC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hard drive defragmenter</strong>: Moves scattered data blocks closer together to improve read times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Startup manager</strong>: Manages which applications and utilities open when you start your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Junk file remover</strong>: Finds and deletes bloatware and junk files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internet connection booster</strong>: Improves your internet speed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
