				<p><strong>London, UK – Mar 6, 2025 –</strong> Canonical, the publisher of Ubuntu, today announced that Renesas Electronics Corporation, a global leader in semiconductor solutions, has joined Canonical’s silicon partner program  to deliver cutting-edge solutions tailored to meet the growing demands of edge computing and AI applications. As industries increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, the need for efficient, scalable, and security-maintained edge computing platforms has never been greater. This partnership will combine Renesas’ expertise in embedded processing with Canonical’s comprehensive internet of Things (IoT) software stack.</p>

<h2 id="scalable-production-grade-solutions">Scalable production-grade solutions </h2>
<p>The collaboration between Canonical and Renesas is designed to empower Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) with scalable, production-grade solutions that reduce time-to-market (TTM). Renesas’ extensive portfolio of embedded hardware platforms allows OEMs and ODMs to select the most efficient solutions tailored to their specific requirements. </p>
<p>This partnership brings Canonical’s optimized Ubuntu image, crafted to integrate seamlessly with Renesas RZ MPUs. This tailored solution grants developers streamlined access to Canonical’s rich ecosystem of tools and open-source applications, accelerating software development and deployment. Additionally, the partnership includes joint marketing and co-selling for Ubuntu Pro, Canonical’s subscription for open source security, support and compliance , to Renesas customers, providing additional value and long term support for their development needs.”Canonical is excited to partner with Renesas to push the boundaries of what is possible at the edge,” said Cindy Goldberg, Vice President of Silicon Alliances at Canonical. “Together, we will provide organizations with the tools they need to reduce time to market for IoT and edge devices  that are compliant and future-proof.”</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-ai-capabilities">Enhanced AI Capabilities </h2>
<p>As edge computing drives the need for localized AI processing, the Canonical-Renesas partnership simplifies the development and deployment of AI applications. Leveraging Renesas’ powerful hardware and Canonical’s Ubuntu operating system, developers can achieve real-time data analysis closer to the source, enabling faster decision-making and reduced latency.</p>
<p>Ubuntu’s open-source ecosystem provides developers with a comprehensive suite of AI frameworks and tools to build and scale AI applications at the edge. Complementing this, the Renesas RZ family of processors offers advanced AI capabilities, including high-performance inferencing, real-time processing, and robust support for AI accelerators. “Renesas’ RZ family is designed to enable developers to unlock the full potential of AI at the edge, combining efficiency and scalability for a wide range of applications,” said Mohammed Dogar, Vice President of Embedded Processing Business Acceleration Division at Renesas. “By combining our hardware expertise with Canonical’s software capabilities, we are well-positioned to deliver cutting-edge solutions that meet the demands of AI applications.”</p>
<h2 id="secured-by-design">Secured by design </h2>
<p>Canonical and Renesas’ partnership emphasizes robust security features. Renesas hardware platforms incorporate robust, hardware-based security measures, ensuring the integrity of edge applications. Canonical complements this with Ubuntu’s enhanced security features, including the snap-based packaging format for robust application confinement, continuous updates, and proactive vulnerability fixes. Ubuntu Core, a containerized operating system,  exemplifies these principles by delivering advanced security tailored for IoT and edge deployments. “Our shared focus on innovation and compliance ensures that enterprises can confidently deploy AI and edge solutions aligned with global regulatory requirements, such as the European Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA),” added Tabish Khan, Sales Director at Canonical.</p>
<p>Canonical is working with Renesas to set new standards in the IoT industry by delivering comprehensive solutions. From scalable production solutions to enhanced AI capabilities and robust security, the combined solution will empower businesses to unlock new opportunities across key verticals such as industrial automation, robotics, smart cities, and healthcare.</p>
