<p>Studying for exams doesn’t have to be stressful. After testing different AI strategies, I found a way to make exam prep more efficient, engaging, and even fun—all while saving time. In this post, I’ll share exactly how I used ChatGPT to create audio-friendly summaries, interactive mock exams, and a stress-free study routine. If you want to study smarter (not harder), this is for you!</p></blockquote>
<p>After <strong>nine semesters of Cognitive Science (B.Sc.)</strong> and <strong>two semesters of Applied Computer Science (M.Sc.)</strong>, I recently faced the toughest exam of my academic career—<strong>Advanced Algorithms</strong> (if you’re curious 🤓). This wasn’t just any exam; it was the final hurdle before heading off to <strong>study abroad in Sydney for over a year</strong>.</p>
<p>At first, I was <em>hella</em> anxious about this one. Not only was the subject insanely challenging, but I also had <strong>a lot on my plate</strong>—a major study project, building my own business, a part-time job, planning my move to Australia, and prepping for a <strong>competitive powerlifting</strong> event. My goal? Just survive and pass.</p>
<p>But guess what? I didn’t just pass—I walked away with a <strong>2.0</strong>, and (somehow) the whole prep process turned out to be <strong>relaxing and even fun</strong>.</p>
<p>Sounds impossible? Keep reading—because Ethan Hunt isn’t the only one pulling off impossible missions. 😆</p>
<p>I already knew that <strong>AI tools like ChatGPT were game-changers for exam prep</strong>—in fact, my <strong>most-read blog post</strong>. so far is all about that.</p>
<p>But through <strong>trial and error</strong>, <strong>research</strong>, and <strong>some creative brainstorming</strong>, I found a way to make it even <strong>more efficient and enjoyable</strong>—allowing me to <strong>save time, reduce stress, and actually have free time</strong> during the exam period.</p>
<p>Here’s exactly how I did it. 🚀</p>
<h2 id="some-initial-key-points">Some Initial Key Points</h2>
<p>I’ve said this before, but it’s worth repeating:</p>
<p>Before diving into the methods, two things are crucial to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time Investment is Essential:</strong> AI tools like ChatGPT <strong>don’t magically reduce study time.</strong> It’s a tool, not a shortcut—you still need to put in the work.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy Check:</strong> AI can get things wrong. Always <strong>double-check and verify the information</strong> before relying on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nowadays, ChatGPT isn’t the only option. Whether you use <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>DeepSeek</strong> (currently one of the hottest names in the IT world), or any other LLM-powered AI ChatBot, the principles remain the same. Just make sure the version you’re using can handle <strong>file attachments and long, detailed conversations.</strong></p>
<p>🛑 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You’ll probably need a pro version for this (depending on the model). Unfortunately, these companies don’t pay me to say this, haha. But I highly recommend investing in a paid version. Not just for exam prep, but in almost every domain of studying and working, <strong>this can make a huge difference.</strong></p>
<p>But enough fanboying. Let’s dive into the practical methods.</p>
<h2 id="oral-or-written-exams-both"><strong>Oral or Written Exams? Both.</strong></h2>
<p>This method works for <strong>both oral and written exams</strong>, and I’ve successfully used it for both formats.</p>
<p>The first part of the method applies universally to all exam types.</p>
<p>The second part, while also applicable to written exams, can be a <strong>game-changer</strong> in oral exams—especially if you have limited prep material, like mock questions.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-creating-lecture-summaries--but-fun-ones-and-for-listening">Step 1: Creating Lecture Summaries – But Fun Ones, and for Listening</h2>
<p>I use ChatGPT (or any AI model that works for you) to generate summaries of my lectures. That’s nothing special. But here’s the catch:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I create 2-3 versions of each summary</strong>, depending on the complexity and how difficult I find the topic.</li>
<li><strong>The summaries are optimized for listening, not reading.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how it works in detail:</p>
<h3 id="multiple-versions">Multiple Versions</h3>
<p>For each lecture, I generate two (sometimes three) different summaries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fun &amp; Engaging Version</strong> – This one is full of vivid examples, analogies, and humor. It makes concepts more memorable and actually fun to listen to. I’ve had plenty of laugh-out-loud moments while reviewing these.</li>
<li><strong>Structured, Formal Version</strong> – A clear, precise, and well-organized summary that feels more like traditional lecture notes. This reinforces the same content but in a more academic tone.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A Format (optional)</strong> – If I really struggle with a lecture, I create a third version: a simple Q&amp;A format. Each key topic is turned into a question with a concise, easy-to-digest answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This redundancy helps reinforce the same material from different angles, making it easier to grasp and remember.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-fun-chatgpt-summaries">Example of Fun ChatGPT Summaries</h3>
<p>Here are some of my favorite moments from ChatGPT’s fun summaries:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Big O Notation:
If running time were a pizza delivery:  
- O(1): The pizza was already at your door.  
- O(log n): You take shortcuts through side streets.  
- O(n): You follow every red light.  
- O(n²): You stop to chat with everyone you know along the way.  
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>In cryptography, hashing a password is like making a smoothie. 
You blend all the ingredients together (password + salt), 
and there’s no way to un-blend it back into the original components. 
And if two people somehow end up with the same smoothie (collision),
well... something went terribly wrong in the kitchen. 
</code></pre><h3 id="how-to-get-the-right-summaries">How to Get the Right Summaries</h3>
<p>It’s crucial to give ChatGPT <strong>precise instructions</strong> on how you want your summaries. Here’s a typical starting prompt I use:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>You are an advanced AI assistant helping me prepare for my **Advanced Algorithms** oral exam.  
The exam is in **6 weeks**, and I need highly precise, structured, and engaging summaries of my lecture content.  

### Important Guidelines:  
- **Accuracy is essential**: Only include verified and correct information. No hallucinations.  
- **No LaTeX**: Do not format any content in LaTeX. Keep all formulas and symbols in plain text.  
- **Audio-Friendly**: The summaries should be optimized for listening, structured in a way that makes them easy to follow when converted to audio.  
- **Cover ALL Content**: The summaries must encompass the entire content of the uploaded lecture slides—do not skip or simplify crucial concepts.  
- **I will upload the lecture slides in the next messages**—wait for them before generating the summaries.  
- **I will tell you in each message which type of summary I want. Generate only that type per request.**  

### Three Summary Types to Generate:  

1: **Fun &amp; Engaging Summary**  
   - Explain the content in a vivid, engaging, and easy-to-digest way.  
   - Use humor, real-world metaphors, and storytelling to make the information stick.  
   - Keep it entertaining while maintaining accuracy.  

2: **Structured &amp; Formal Summary**  
   - A clear, to-the-point version that mimics a well-structured lecture or textbook summary.  
   - Include key concepts, definitions, and explanations in an organized way.  
   - No fluff, just high-quality learning material.  

3: **Q&amp;A Summary**  
   - Format the content into a series of concise questions and answers.  
   - Each question should challenge understanding, and each answer should be clear and easy to grasp.  
   - Prioritize the most important exam-relevant aspects of the lecture.  

Before proceeding, paraphrase your task briefly to ensure we&#39;re aligned.  
Wait for the slides before starting the summaries.  
</code></pre><p>Then, I upload my lecture slides and use a short follow-up prompt to specify the key aspects of how I want the summary structured and which format I need.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Here are my slides for **Lecture 8**.  

Please create the **fun summary** for this lecture.  
- Make it **as engaging as possible** with humor, vivid examples, and a storytelling approach.  
- **Include all content** from the slides—nothing should be skipped or overly simplified.  
- **No LaTeX at all**—keep all formulas and symbols in plain text.  
- **Optimize for listening**—structure it in a way that is clear and enjoyable as an audio format.  
- **Be precise and correct**—fun is great, but accuracy is key.  
</code></pre><p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> If you don’t want ChatGPT to use LaTeX (which it loves for formulas, but is awful when turned into audio), make sure to state this explicitly. It often forgets, but a quick reminder usually fixes it. If needed, stop the generation, restate your request, and regenerate the summary.</p>
<h3 id="converting-summaries-to-audio">Converting Summaries to Audio</h3>
<p>Once I have a summary, I use <strong>TTSMaker</strong> (a text-to-speech tool, pro version) to convert the text into an audio file. There are plenty of alternatives, but I found this one to be the easiest and most cost-effective.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Copy the summary</strong> → paste it into the TTS tool → generate the audio.</li>
<li><strong>Listen to the audio while reading along</strong> to check for clarity and make small tweaks if needed, and to rehearse the concepts a first time.</li>
<li><strong>If all is good, move on to the next summary.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>💾 <strong>Organizing Files</strong></p>
<p>To keep things structured, I save the audio files using a clear naming system:</p>
<p><code>[subject]_[lecture number]_[summary type]</code></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>advancedAlgos_l12_fun.mp3</code></p>
<p><code>advancedAlgos_l08_QnA.mp3</code></p>
<p>After a session of generating multiple summaries, I send them to my phone. I just <strong>drop them in my WhatsApp chat with myself</strong> (works best for quick access), but any file transfer method works.</p>
<h3 id="actually-listening-to-the-summaries">Actually Listening to the Summaries</h3>
<p>Creating the summaries is just step one. The real magic happens when you <strong>integrate them into your daily routine.</strong></p>
<p>I try to <strong>listen to each summary at least 4 times</strong> over a span of 4-6 weeks (or more condensed if exams are closer).</p>
<p>🚀 <strong>Best Times to Listen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Driving home from university</li>
<li>During workouts</li>
<li>Grocery shopping</li>
<li>Hiking (yes, studying while hiking = perfect productivity hack!)</li>
<li>Cooking (as long as it’s a simple recipe)</li>
</ul>
<p>This method <strong>saves me a ton of time</strong> while keeping exam prep stress-free. I’m reinforcing concepts passively throughout my day instead of staring at a screen all the time.</p>
<h3 id="last-minute-revision">Last-Minute Revision</h3>
<p>The hours before an exam, I do a final run-through:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go for a long walk</strong> to clear my head.</li>
<li><strong>Listen to my summaries one last time</strong> to refresh everything.</li>
<li><strong>Grab a coffee, take a deep breath, and relax.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it. The content is fresh in my mind, I’ve had plenty of exposure to it, and I’m ready to go.<br>
And you&rsquo;ll be, too!</p>
<h2 id="step-2-practice--the-key-to-retention">Step 2: Practice – The Key to Retention</h2>
<p>Once I’ve created my summaries, the next crucial step is <strong>active practice</strong>. Depending on how much time I have, I either focus entirely on review first and then practice, or I mix both throughout my prep. I’ve tested different approaches, and both can work well.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>mock exams or practice sheets</strong>, those are obviously great resources. However, for oral exams (and even for some written ones), they often don’t exist or aren’t sufficient. That’s where <strong>ChatGPT becomes an insanely useful tool for exam simulations.</strong></p>
<h3 id="mock-exams-with-chatgpt">Mock Exams with ChatGPT</h3>
<p>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend starting a <strong>new chat for mock exams</strong>. Long, messy chats covering multiple topics tend to confuse the model, making the responses inconsistent. A fresh chat keeps it sharp and focused.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Here’s how I use mock exams effectively:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with single-lecture mock exams</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I tell ChatGPT exactly how I want the exam structured.</li>
<li>It usually does a great job at replicating real exam conditions.</li>
<li>I <strong>always write out my answers</strong> in full sentences, regardless of whether it’s a written or oral exam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gradually expand to full-topic mock exams</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once I’ve covered all lectures individually, I combine them into bigger exams.</li>
<li>This helps simulate the real exam structure and ensures I understand connections between topics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be aware: ChatGPT grades too nicely!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI models are trained to be encouraging, so they tend to be generous with grades.</li>
<li>I once got an <em>A</em> even though I missed half the answers. 😂</li>
<li>To fix this, I explicitly tell ChatGPT: <strong>“Grade me strictly, as a real examiner would.”</strong></li>
<li>After doing this, the grading became way more realistic and actually useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>🚀 <strong>Here’s my go-to prompt for generating mock exams:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>You are a helpful assistant supporting me in preparing for my **oral exam in Advanced Algorithms**.  
Your role is to act as my **exam simulator**, focusing on one lecture at a time.  
This chat is **strictly for exam simulations**—do not include any explanations, summaries, or unrelated content.  

### **Exam Simulation Instructions:**  

1. **Exam Structure (Per Lecture)**  
   - Each mock exam consists of exactly **10 questions**.  
   - These questions should **only** be based on the content of the specific lecture I specify.  
   - Label each one as **“Question X:”**, where **X** is the question number (1 through 10).  

2. **Question Types**  
   - Questions may be **standalone** or **follow-up questions** that build on my previous answers.  
   - If my answer is incomplete or reveals uncertainty, ask a **follow-up question** to dig deeper or clarify concepts.  
   - If my answer is fully correct and demonstrates strong understanding, proceed to a **new independent question**.  

3. **Exam Procedure**  
   - Once I specify the **lecture number** and **difficulty level**, begin the exam with a professional greeting, as in a real oral exam.  
   - Ask **Question 1**, then wait for my response.  
   - Based on my answer:  
     - If clarification is needed → **Ask a follow-up question.**  
     - If the answer is complete → **Move on to a new question.**  
   - Continue this format until all 10 questions have been completed.  

4. **Feedback and Grading**  
   - After the 10th question, provide the following:  
     - An **overall grade** for my performance.  
     - General **feedback** on my strengths and weaknesses.  
     - A **question-by-question review**, correcting mistakes where necessary and offering additional insight if an answer was incomplete or incorrect.  
   - After providing feedback, ask whether I want to start another simulation.  

5. **Difficulty Levels**  
   - Each mock exam follows a difficulty level: **easy, medium, or hard** (which I will specify).  
   - **Easy**: Straightforward questions covering fundamental concepts.  
   - **Medium**: A mix of fundamental and more challenging questions.  
   - **Hard**: Complex, multi-step problems that test deeper understanding.  

6. **Topic-Specific Focus**  
   - I will indicate the **lecture number** each time.  
   - The 10 questions should **fully cover key topics** from that lecture.  
   - Use precise, exam-relevant phrasing to simulate an actual oral exam setting.  

7. **Use of Materials**  
   - I will upload **lecture slides** after this prompt. Use them as the **sole reference** for generating exam questions.  
   - Ensure that the questions comprehensively reflect the content of the provided slides.  

### **Important Notes:**  
- Do **not** provide explanations or hints before I answer—this is a simulation, not a tutoring session.  
- Keep questions **clear and direct**, just like in a real oral exam.  
- If I request a new mock exam, generate a fresh set of 10 questions.
- Maintain a **balanced mix of follow-ups and new questions** to best simulate an adaptive exam experience.  

I will now specify the **lecture number and difficulty level** for the first simulation. Let’s begin.   
</code></pre><h3 id="the-power-of-iteration">The Power of Iteration</h3>
<p>After going through <strong>mock exams for each lecture separately</strong>, I move on to <strong>comprehensive exams covering everything</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, I start a <strong>new chat</strong> and use a similar prompt to before:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>You are a helpful assistant supporting me in preparing for my **oral exam in Advanced Algorithms**.  
Your role is to act as my **exam simulator**, covering all lectures in a single session.  
This chat is **strictly for exam simulations**—do not include any explanations, summaries, or unrelated content.  

### **Exam Simulation Instructions:**  

1. **Exam Structure (All Lectures Combined)**  
   - Each mock exam consists of exactly **10 questions**.  
   - These questions should **cover multiple lectures**, ensuring a balanced representation of all key topics.  
   - Label each one as **“Question X:”**, where **X** is the question number (1 through 10).  

2. **Question Types**  
   - Questions may be **standalone** or **follow-up questions** that build on my previous answers.  
   - If my answer is incomplete or reveals uncertainty, ask a **follow-up question** to dig deeper or clarify concepts.  
   - If my answer is fully correct and demonstrates strong understanding, proceed to a **new independent question** from a different lecture.  

3. **Exam Procedure**  
   - Once I specify the **difficulty level**, begin the exam with a professional greeting, as in a real oral exam.  
   - Ask **Question 1**, then wait for my response.  
   - Based on my answer:  
     - If clarification is needed → **Ask a follow-up question.**  
     - If the answer is complete → **Move on to a question from a different lecture.**  
   - Ensure that by the end of the 10 questions, multiple lectures have been covered.  

4. **Feedback and Grading**  
   - After the 10th question, provide the following:  
     - An **overall grade** for my performance.  
     - General **feedback** on my strengths and weaknesses.  
     - A **question-by-question review**, correcting mistakes where necessary and offering additional insight if an answer was incomplete or incorrect.  
   - After providing feedback, ask whether I want to start another simulation.  

5. **Difficulty Levels**  
   - Each mock exam follows a difficulty level: **easy, medium, or hard** (which I will specify).  
   - **Easy**: Straightforward questions covering fundamental concepts from multiple lectures.  
   - **Medium**: A mix of fundamental and more challenging questions from various lectures.  
   - **Hard**: Complex, multi-step problems that test deeper understanding across all topics.  

6. **Topic Distribution**  
   - Ensure **all key lectures** are represented across the 10 questions.  
   - Do not cluster multiple questions from the same lecture back-to-back—spread them out.  
   - The mix of topics should resemble a real comprehensive exam, where I have to switch between subjects.  

7. **Use of Materials**  
   - I will upload **lecture slides** after this prompt. Use them as the **sole reference** for generating exam questions.  
   - Ensure that the questions comprehensively reflect the content of the provided slides.  

### **Important Notes:**  
- Do **not** provide explanations or hints before I answer—this is a simulation, not a tutoring session.  
- Keep questions **clear and direct**, just like in a real oral exam.  
- If I request a new mock exam, generate a fresh set of 10 questions.  
- Maintain a **balanced mix of follow-ups and new questions** to best simulate an adaptive exam experience.  
- Ensure the exam **covers different lectures evenly** to prevent an accidental overfocus on a single topic.  

I will now specify the **difficulty level** for the first simulation. Let’s begin.  
</code></pre><p>At this point, ChatGPT typically <strong>adapts to my weaknesses</strong>, focusing more on topics where I struggle. Sometimes, it even asks if I want extra reinforcement in those areas. If not, I can also <strong>manually request</strong> extra questions on weak topics.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>In the following exam simulations, please **prioritize questions on topics where I previously struggled**.  
If I made mistakes or showed uncertainty in past answers, reinforce those areas by:  
- Asking more questions on similar concepts.  
- Gradually increasing the difficulty level to challenge my understanding.  

If I need additional reinforcement on a specific topic, I will let you know. Otherwise, continue with a balanced mix across all lectures.  
</code></pre><h3 id="the-power-of-writing-your-answers">The Power of Writing Your Answers</h3>
<p>I <strong>always write out my answers</strong>, no matter if the exam is written or oral.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>For written exams:</strong> Writing full responses improves recall and ensures I can express my thoughts clearly in writing.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>For oral exams:</strong> Writing answers first helps me structure my thoughts, making it easier to recall key points when speaking.</p>
<p>This forces me to:</p>
<p>✅ Structure my thoughts clearly</p>
<p>✅ Avoid glossing over weak spots</p>
<p>✅ Reinforce my memory through active recall</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Struggling with recall? That’s actually a good thing.</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that <strong>forcing your brain to retrieve information—even unsuccessfully at first—actually improves memory</strong>. If you’re getting things wrong, that’s part of the process! Every failed recall attempt strengthens long-term learning.</p>
<h3 id="making-practice-fun">Making Practice Fun</h3>
<p>To keep things engaging, I apply the <strong>same fun approach as in my summaries:</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Answer with vivid examples</strong> – Making concepts relatable helps me remember them better.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Inject some humor</strong> – I challenge myself to explain things in a way that would make ChatGPT smile (if it could).</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Use analogies</strong> – If ChatGPT can explain a concept using pizza metaphors, so can I!</p>
<h3 id="bonus-this-works-in-the-real-exam-too">Bonus: This Works in the Real Exam Too</h3>
<p>Adding a bit of personality to your real exam answers (especially oral ones) often <strong>makes the experience smoother and more enjoyable for both you and the examiner</strong>.</p>
<p>During my last exam, my professor <strong>laughed out loud</strong> at one of my examples and even complimented my explanation. That moment alone made the entire process feel so much less stressful.</p>
<p>So, <strong>don’t be afraid to inject a bit of fun into your study approach—and even into the exam itself!</strong></p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>Using <strong>audio summaries</strong>, multiple summary styles, and <strong>a mix of lecture-based and full mock exams</strong>—all while keeping things fun and engaging—has completely changed how I prepare for exams.</p>
<p>It’s made the process <strong>less stressful, way more effective, and even enjoyable</strong> (yes, really!).</p>
<p>I hope this method helps you, too! <strong>Give it a try, and let me know how it works for you.</strong></p>
<p>And of course—if ChatGPT throws in any hilarious jokes while generating your fun summaries, <strong>share them in the comments!</strong> I’d love to hear them. 😆</p>
<p>Now go crush that exam. 🚀</p>
