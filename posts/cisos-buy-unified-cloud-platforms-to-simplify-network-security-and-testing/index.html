<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 3, 2025</p>
<p>Today’s security teams are tasked with managing an increasingly intricate web of responsibilities. These range from ensuring compliance and continuous security testing, resilience to integrating security protocols, and managing a growing array of devices—from IoT ecosystems to remote work setups. This complexity often overwhelms even the most experienced teams.</p>
<p>More than half of IT leaders are struggling with role expansion citing network security as their primary concern.</p>
<p>According to a recent 2025 industry survey with CISOs, CIOs and senior level IT decision-makers, enterprises are recognizing the necessity of unified cloud platforms to simplify security testing and operations while reducing the overhead of the fragmentation associated with managing disparate systems and tool sprawl.</p>
<p>This need is reshaping the IT landscape, with CISOs planning significant investments in their security testing and networks over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>BreachLock, a top cybersecurity company recognized by Gartner from 2021 to 2024 as a leading vendor in the Penetration Testing as a Service market, makes a compelling case for unified platforms, and they explain how to get there.</p>
