				<p><strong>Dish Network</strong> is just a month into the commercial launch of its  cloud native based 5G core network, but is already planning how it will expand that architecture to take advantage of multicloud and hybrid cloud environments.</p>
<p>During a <strong>Dish-Nokia</strong> fireside chat this Tuesday (sponsored by Nokia) on LinkedIn, <strong>Jitin Bhandari – CTO and VP, Cloud and Network Services, Nokia</strong> interviewed <strong>Sidd Chenumolu, VP of technology development and network services at Dish Wireless</strong>, provided some insight into the carrier’s current use of <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud resources.</strong>  </p>
<p>Chenumolu said Dish’s 5G core was currently using three of AWS’ four public regions, was deployed in “multiple availability zones and almost all the local zones, but most were deployed with Nokia applications across AWS around the country.”</p>
<p>[AWS Outposts GM Joshua Burgin had previously explained to SDxCentral that Dish would be using a mixture of AWS Regions, Local Zones, and Outposts, specifically the smaller form factor AWS Outposts servers, to power its network. This includes the deployment of single 1U Outpost servers, some with an accelerator card, to run network functions in single-digit milliseconds at cell sites, he said in a phone interview.]</p>
<p>AWS Local Zones, which are built on Outpost racks and span 15 locations around the U.S., some of which were deployed to meet Dish’s demands, run Dish’s less latency-sensitive functions, Burgin explained. Dish’s operations and business support systems will run on AWS Regions.</p>
<p>“How to we deploy 5G SA core network on multi-cloud,” Sidd asked but did not answer.  He then started to turn the tables and interview Jitin via a series of questions.</p>
<p>Chenumolu did not provide an update on Dish’s use of AWS’ Wavelength platform, which the cloud giant initially launched in partnership with Verizon to marry the network operators’ 5G networks with AWS’ edge compute service. Burgin had previously stated that support “could come down the line.”</p>
<p><em>The usual hype and back slapping/praise with glib expressions like “disintegrated disruptor, uncharted territory, automate learning with AI, cloud RAN,” etc. characterized the session.</em></p>
