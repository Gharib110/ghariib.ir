				<p>The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is decentralized blockchain technology, it is secure and transparent which provides an alternative to centralized internet cloud providers.</p>
<p>ICP maintains an independent data center that aims to bring efficient data, speed, and decentralization to computation and data storage. Internet Computer protocol uses ICP as its native cryptocurrency which is used to pay transaction fees, rewards, incentives, and other transactions. Users can build their DApps on ICP, which allows developers to write their smart contracts in different popular languages like Rust, TypeScript, or Python. The smart contract is regarded as canisters which are hosted on an ICP blockchain network called subnet.</p>
<p>ICP was developed by DFINITY Foundation, it structure combines advanced cryptography, novel consensus mechanisms and muddler subnet architecture to build a world computer that put stroke on traditional cloud infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Architectural Innovation</strong> Canister Smart contract The Core concept of ICP computational units are canister smart contracts, which are compiled and bundled in WebAssembly (WASM) code.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It has the ability to hold gigabytes of memory for a low fee.</li>
<li>Canister pays for their own computation via ICP native token which also implements a reverse gas model where users donâ€™t have to cover cost.</li>
<li>Dapp can be fully hosted on the ICP blockchain without relying on central cloud service.</li>
<li>Canisters are built to be evolving which can be upgraded</li>
</ul>
