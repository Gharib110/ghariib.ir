				<p>With the recent announcement of Google Threat Intelligence, I want to take this opportunity, as VirusTotal&rsquo;s founder, to directly address our community and reiterate our unwavering commitment to our core mission.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to assure our entire community, from security researchers and industry partners to individual users, that VirusTotal&rsquo;s core mission remains unchanged. We remain deeply dedicated to collective intelligence and collaboration, fostering a platform where everyone can come together to share knowledge, access valuable threat information, and contribute to the fight against cyber threats.</p>
<p>Google Threat Intelligence is a new offering that builds upon the strengths of Google, Mandiant, VirusTotal, and other sources. It will be available as a premium tier, evolving the existing VirusTotal Enterprise platform, as well as the Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence one.</p>
<p>Importantly, VirusTotal remains committed to a level playing field, ensuring all partners, including Google Threat Intelligence, have equal access to the crowdsourced data VirusTotal collects. We also want to assure you that the core features and functionalities of VirusTotal will remain free and accessible to everyone, as always.</p>
<p>The strength of VirusTotal lies in its network of contributors and the vast amount of data they provide. This data serves as a valuable resource for the entire security industry, empowering our partners and others to enhance their products and contribute to a more secure digital world. This collaborative approach, based on transparency and equal access, strengthens the industry as a whole, ultimately leading to better protection for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that change can be unsettling, but we want to assure you that VirusTotal is here to stay. We are excited about the future and the opportunity to continue sharing knowledge and protecting together with all of you, making the digital world a safer place through the power of collective intelligence.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support.</p>
