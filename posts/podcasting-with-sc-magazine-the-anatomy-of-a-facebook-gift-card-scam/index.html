<p>This week’s post on Disassembling the Woolworths Facebook scam has had a pretty good run. In part, I suspect this is due to the approaching holiday shopping season and in part because I know this scam is really doing the rounds and being seen by a lot of people.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a chat with Dan Kaplan from Secure Computing Magazine for their podcast and pointed out a number of factors that make scams like this successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>They’re endorsed by your friends. You’re seeing people you know like and share these scams as that’s a condition of their “entry”. They have <em>credibility</em>.</li>
<li>They’re a very low-overhead for the scammer. This is nothing more than a web page.</li>
<li>There aren’t really any native browser defences against this sort of scam unless the site they’re running on is flagged.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compare that to the relative difficulty of mounting an email campaign:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s costly in so far as every email has a price. It might be very small or it might be orchestrated by botnets but that also has a cost. Certainly it’s more than just standing up a single web page.</li>
<li>Victims are cottoning on. People are pretty used to filtering out junk these days and are naturally suspicious of email.</li>
<li>Mail servers and clients provide native defences. It’s a very small portion of email that actually makes it into my Hotmail inbox and turns out to be junk.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, get used to seeing social media generated scams. The risk is low and the ROI is too good to pass up!</p>
