				<p>If you&rsquo;re a marketer in 2024, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone suggests a podcast. ðŸ˜… In fact, you might be working on your company&rsquo;s podcast right now, or listening to one as you cruise your inbox.</p>
<p>Well, here at Giant Swarm, we&rsquo;ve taken the podcast plunge ourselves. But our journey into the world of podcasting isn&rsquo;t your typical marketing strategy, or at least that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re telling ourselves. It&rsquo;s a story of experimentation and a genuine desire to connect in a more human way. Plus, itâ€™s really fun to find a jingle on Fiverr each weekâ€¦Â </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been a bit unconventional in our approach to sharing knowledge and engaging with our community. Our monthly Giant Swarm &amp; Friends events are a testament to that, and we&rsquo;re really proud of what we&rsquo;ve nurtured there. We&rsquo;ve also invested in webinars, blog posts (oh, hi there!), and live events, which we continue to pursue and enjoy. But alongside these initiatives, we couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like there was room for something more.</p>
<p>We realized that what we really craved was a more informal, conversational way of connecting with our fellow curious minds in the cloud native landscape. A space where we could share our stories, laugh together (and at ourselves) and learn from each other in a more approachable way.</p>
<p>Enter Giant Conversations, our weekly podcasting experiment. ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that we&rsquo;re not all podcast experts&hellip; Our co-host Oliver is a podcast veteran on the other hand, with not one but two podcasts of his own! But all things considered, we&rsquo;re figuring this out as we go along, learning (and laughing) from our missteps, and embracing the joy of the journey. There&rsquo;s just something special about hitting upload each week and putting ourselves out there, even if it feels a bit unfamiliar at times. But what we lack in experience, we make up for in enthusiasm and a genuine desire to create something valuable Â and fun for our community.</p>
<p>Each episode of Giant Conversations is an invitation to join us as we sit down with a diverse mix of voices from the cloud native community. We&rsquo;ll be diving into a wide range of topics, from buzzworthy news items and technical challenges we face every day to the bigger questions that keep us curious and engaged.</p>
<p>One week, you might find us chatting with the renowned Liz Rice, tapping into her vast expertise as we explore the latest trends and emerging technologies shaping the future of the cloud native industry. With her finger on the pulse, Liz offers thought-provoking insights into the cutting-edge developments and potential paradigm shifts on the horizon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next, we could be swapping KubeCon stories and getting locals-only recommendations for Paris. Or unpacking the latest developments and debates in the open source space withÂ Kubeshop&rsquo;s Cortney Nickerson, who joined us for a thought-provoking discussion on whether successful open source projects can truly coexist with monetization priorities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact, we recommend checking out some of our latest episodes to get a flavor of what Giant Conversations is all about. For example, our chat with Miles Bryant from the innovative team at Monzo offered a rare behind-the-scenes look into their early adoption of Kubernetes 1.3 â€” putting them ahead of the curve. Miles provided insights into the pioneering strategies and forward-thinking approach that have underpinned Monzo&rsquo;s trailblazing journey, giving listeners a fascinating glimpse into the future of cloud native banking.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re curious about what&rsquo;s been happening behind the scenes here at Giant Swarm, our CTO Timo&rsquo;s explainer on our big move to Giant Swarm Platform 3.0 is not to be missed.Â </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But more than anything, we want Giant Conversations to be a dialogue, not a monologue. We want to hear your stories, your questions, and your ideas. We want to create a space where we can all learn and grow together.Â </p>
<p>Subscribe to Giant Conversations on your favorite podcast platform, and let&rsquo;s see where this experiment takes us. Will it be a smooth ride? Probably not. Will we make mistakes along the way? Almost certainly. But will it be an authentic, engaging, and ultimately rewarding experience? We&rsquo;re betting on it.</p>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned cloud native pro or just dipping your toes into the Kubernetes waters, we hope you&rsquo;ll join us for some Giant Conversations. Let&rsquo;s embrace the spirit of experimentation, learn from each other, and definitely have a little fun along the way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to the journey ahead! ðŸŽŠ</p>
