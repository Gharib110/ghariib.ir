				<p><em>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Retro‚Äôing and Debugging 2024.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people who love looking back on a year. Reflecting on what I&rsquo;ve done, what I&rsquo;ve learned, and what I want to achieve in the following year. This year‚Äîlike many others‚ÄîI jumped on Twitch to recap my year, review the stats, and talk about what I want to do moving forward.</p>
<p>Here are the stats, things I learned, and goals I have for 2025. The main reason I like sharing these things is to inspire and motivate others. I hope you find it interesting ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>
<h2 id="2024-stats-and-achievements">2024 Stats and Achievements</h2>
<p>I look at the main things I completed during the year. For me, as a developer advocate and influencer, a lot of what I do is content creation. I check out the number of conferences I spoke at, videos I created, blog posts written, and even GitHub contributions. After adding them all up, you can see the stats yourself:</p>

<p>Finally, I looked at a couple of big things I achieved. I was really excited to win one of DEV&rsquo;s first DEV challenges, and it motivated and encouraged me to submit to more in future, including this one.</p>

<p>I also won some awards that I&rsquo;m really proud of, and was selected in the &ldquo;top 3% of most active speakers on Sessionize&rdquo;. Something I think that&rsquo;s really important when it comes to stats and achievements is thanking people üôè. Most of the things I&rsquo;ve achieved in the past year wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without others: conference organisers who selected my sessions, colleagues who put me forward for opportunities, and those who chose to publish my articles. In one of my LinkedIn posts I tagged and thanked multiple people and organisations who helped me achieve these numbers last year.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-learned">Things I learned</h2>
<p>Retrospectives wouldn&rsquo;t be useful if we didn&rsquo;t learn anything from them. I picked up some really cool technical skills last year.</p>
<h3 id="test-writing-and-test-driven-development">Test writing and test driven development</h3>
<p>One of my colleagues took time out to teach me all about writing tests for code. I learned about test driven development (TDD), the testing hierarchy, and the importance of writing tests, as well as types of testing. I documented these learnings in a blog post:</p>

<p>One of the reasons I love writing blog posts, is not only to share my knowledge and learnings with others, but to have good documentation that I can refer back to when I need it. There have been at least three occasions since writing the article where I&rsquo;ve been building websites and writing tests, and I&rsquo;ve referred back to this article. Thus, I encourage you, if you learn something new, write about.</p>
<h3 id="online-learning">Online Learning</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known about LinkedIn Learning for a while, having featured it under my GitHub repo of free learning resources for several years, however I feel as though the platform is now well-developed, featuring many different types of learning‚Äîfrom technical to management, project engineering, emotional intelligence, resilience, and more.</p>
<p>As such, I&rsquo;ve completed over 60 LinkedIn Learning courses, most in the past few months. It&rsquo;s a great way to upskill and discover new areas of learning. There&rsquo;s also Microsoft Learn where I completed several courses. I&rsquo;d encourage you to add learning‚Äîboth formal and informal‚Äîto your goals for 2025.</p>
<h3 id="learning-to-say-no">Learning to say no</h3>
<p>This is one of the hardest things, especially for someone like me who really likes to help people. Learning to say no‚Äîand actually doing it this year‚Äîtaught me a lot. I gained a lot more time that I could use for more impactful things, and other people valued and respected my time more. Whilst I&rsquo;ve always known these things, and have been to so many different talks on the subject, it&rsquo;s really hard to actually do. But once you do, there&rsquo;s something liberating about putting it into practice.</p>
<p>I believe it was during Christina&rsquo;s talk at NDC London last year that I finally thought &ldquo;Right! I&rsquo;m going to do this&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not only is she a brilliant speaker, but she also pointed out one of the things I struggled with when saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;: how not to feel bad about it. I&rsquo;d recommend giving her talk a watch.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-2025">Goals for 2025</h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really good to reflect on what we&rsquo;ve done and learned and look forward. Well, from this post, it&rsquo;s clear I did a lot, and learned a lot from 2024, so how do I top that? On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, as my husband and I sat on the beach, sipping champagne and waiting for the fireworks, we asked each other about our goals for this year.</p>
<p>So if you want to hear about how I structure yearly goals, and learn a bit about my 2025 goals, check out my next blog post:</p>
