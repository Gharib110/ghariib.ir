<p>Schneider Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA.</p>
<h2 id="4-mitigations">4. MITIGATIONS</h2>
<p>Version 2.1 or later of EcoStruxure Panel Server includes a fix for this vulnerability and is available for <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/product-range/40739468-ecostruxure-panel-server/?parent-subcategory-id=4160#software-and-firmware">download.</a> Users should download EcoStruxure Power Commission Software v2.33.0 or later, and version v2.1 or later of EcoStruxure Panel Server firmware to complete the upgrade process.</p>
<p>Users should employ appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on an offline infrastructure. <a href="https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp">Contact Schneider Electric&rsquo;s Customer Care Center</a> for assistance removing a patch.</p>
<p>If users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately ensure that debug mode is off will prevent the credentials from being improperly exposed.</p>
<p>Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.</li>
<li>Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.</li>
<li>Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the &ldquo;Program&rdquo; mode.</li>
<li>Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.</li>
<li>Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.</li>
<li>Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.</li>
<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.</li>
<li>When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>
<li>For more information refer to the <a href="https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/">Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.</a></li>
