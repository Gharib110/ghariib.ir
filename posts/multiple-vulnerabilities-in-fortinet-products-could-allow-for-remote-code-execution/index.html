				<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console. FortiOS is the Fortinetâ€™s proprietary Operation System which is utilized across multiple product lines. FortiProxy is a secure web gateway that attempts to protects users against internet-borne attacks, and provides protection and visibility to the network against unauthorized access and threats. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
