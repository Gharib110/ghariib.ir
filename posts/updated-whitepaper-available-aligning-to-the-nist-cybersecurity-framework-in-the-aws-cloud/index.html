			<h1>Updated whitepaper available: Aligning to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the AWS Cloud</h1>
			<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
		       

			<div>
				<p>Today, we released an updated version of the Aligning to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) in the AWS Cloud whitepaper to reflect the significant changes introduced in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, published in February 2024. This comprehensive update helps you understand how AWS services align with the enhanced framework and how you can use AWS capabilities to improve your cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p>The NIST CSF 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. The updated version introduces important changes, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new “Govern” Core Function, emphasizing procedural and organizational activities that have an impact on the management of cybersecurity risk within organizations.</li>
<li>An expanded scope, beyond critical infrastructure, to help organizations of many sizes and sectors.</li>
<li>Enhanced guidance for privacy risk management and supply chain security.</li>
<li>Updated Categories and Subcategories that better reflect current cybersecurity challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>In accordance with the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, the whitepaper provides a detailed mapping of AWS services to the six CSF Core Functions: Govern (New), Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Organizations can use this whitepaper to understand how AWS services align with NIST CSF 2.0 requirements, implement AWS solutions to help achieve their security objectives, use AWS capabilities for automated security operations, and build resilient architectures that support their cybersecurity strategies.</p>
<p>Security and compliance remain our top priorities at AWS. This updated whitepaper demonstrates our commitment to helping customers align with the latest security frameworks while protecting their data and resources in the AWS Cloud. The whitepaper also includes practical guidance for implementing AWS services and features that support the CSF outcomes, whether you’re just starting your cloud journey or looking to enhance your existing security posture.</p>
<p>To learn more about implementing NIST CSF 2.0 in your organization by using AWS services, contact your AWS account team or download the whitepaper.</p>
