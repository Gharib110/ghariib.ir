<p>Here is a very quick announcement for users of the Kali Linux Docker Images. Until recently we used to have a Docker image named simply kali, and it was built from the last versioned release of Kali (e.g. 2019.4, 2020.1, etc.) matching our “kali-last-snapshot” network repositories branch.

<p>Here is a very quick announcement for users of the <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/official-kalilinux-docker-images/">Kali Linux Docker Images</a>.</p>
<p>Until recently we used to have a Docker image named simply <code>kali</code>, and it was built from the last <a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">versioned release</a> of Kali (e.g. 2019.4, 2020.1, etc.) matching our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-branches/">“kali-last-snapshot” network repositories branch</a>. In a way, this is our “stable” release, as it will only get updates quarterly as it is in synchronisation with our release cycle.</p>
<p>We still provide this <strong>Docker image</strong>, but now it has been <strong>renamed from <code>kali</code> to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/kali-last-release"><code>kali-last-release</code></a></strong> for clarity.</p>
<p>The old <code>kali</code> Docker image is still around for the time being, but if you use it you will see a deprecation warning to indicate that it is in the <strong>process of being phased out</strong>. The rest of the deprecation plan is as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon Kali <code>2022.1</code> release, we will update the image to make it fail, meaning that the container will error out with a helpful message when you try to run it.</li>
<li>Upon Kali <code>2022.2</code> release, we will completely remove it from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/">our Docker Hub</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you still use this image in your scripts or Dockerfiles, <strong>please update</strong> those and use <code>kali-last-release</code> instead.</p>
<p>An additional reminder: if you are after the <strong>most up-to-date version of Kali, you probably want to use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/kali-last-release">kali-rolling</a> Docker image</strong>. This is the “main” image <em>(which matches our other platforms)</em>, and it is updated every week <em>(the network packages get updated daily also like all other Kali platforms)</em>.</p>
<p>For lots more details, please refer to our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/official-kalilinux-docker-images/">official Kali Docker documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you and happy 11111100110!</p>
<p>PS – On a related topic: the Kali images were recently added to the <a href="https://github.com/containers/shortnames">containers shortnames list</a>. It means that <strong>Podman users</strong> can run a Kali container simply by typing <code>podman run -it kali-rolling</code>, rather than using the full image name <code>docker.io/kalilinux/kali-rolling</code>. This works if the host system provides a very up-to-date shortnames list in <code>/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf</code>. <em>If your host system is Kali Rolling, that’s already the case!</em></p>
