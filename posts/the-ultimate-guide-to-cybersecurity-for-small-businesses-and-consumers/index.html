<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 28, 2025</p>
<p>In our hyper-connected world, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. With increasing reliance on digital technologies, individuals and organizations face a growing array of cyber threats, ranging from data breaches to ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>Cybercrime is projected to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.</p>
<p>Understanding cybersecurity and implementing effective strategies is essential to safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring online safety, but it’s far easier for large organizations who employ full time security professionals.</p>
<p>A short easy-to-read guide for small businesses and consumers (who are all too often under-protected) explores the fundamentals of cybersecurity and emerging threats, and provides bulleted resources with tips for best practices and links to third party resources.</p>
<p>The handy reference guide published by DEV, a community of 2.7 million software developers, is a good starting point for defending against phishing attacks that are headed your way in 2025.</p>
