				<p>The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) assists agencies in development of their Zero Trust strategies and continued evolution of their implementation plans. In April of 2024, we released Microsoft guidance for the Department of Defense Zero Trust Strategy. And now, we are excited to share new Microsoft Guidance for CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model. Our guidance is designed to help United States government agencies and their industry partners configure Microsoft cloud services as they transition to Zero Trust, on their journey to achieve advanced and optimal security.</p>
<p>Microsoft has embraced Zero Trust principles—both in the way we secure our own enterprise environment and for our customers. We’ve been helping thousands of organizations worldwide transition to a Zero Trust security model, including many United States government agencies. In this blog, we’ll preview the new guidance and share how it helps United States government agencies and their partners implement their Zero Trust strategies. We’ll also share the Microsoft Zero Trust platform and relevant solutions that help meet CISA’s Zero Trust requirements, and close with two examples of real-world deployments.</p>

<p>The CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model includes <strong>five pillars</strong> that represent protection areas for Zero Trust:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identity</strong>: An identity refers to an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describes an agency user or entity, including non-person entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Devices</strong>: A device refers to any asset (including its hardware, software, and firmware) that can connect to a network, including servers, desktop and laptop machines, printers, mobile phones, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, networking equipment, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Networks</strong>: A network refers to an open communications medium including typical channels such as agency internal networks, wireless networks, and the internet as well as other potential channels such as cellular and application-level channels used to transport messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applications and workloads</strong>: Applications and workloads include agency systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile devices, and in cloud environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data</strong>: Data includes all structured and unstructured files and fragments that reside or have resided in federal systems, devices, networks, applications, databases, infrastructure, and backups (including on-premises and virtual environments) as well as the associated metadata.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The model also integrates capabilities that span across all pillars, to enhance cross-function interoperability—including <strong>visibility and analytics, automation and orchestration, and governance</strong>. The model further includes the four maturity stages of the Zero Trust Maturity Model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Traditional</strong>: The starting point for many government organizations, where assessment and identification of gaps helps determine security priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial</strong>: Organizations will have begun implementing automation in areas such as attribute assignment, lifecycle management, and initial cross-pillar solutions including integration of external systems, least privilege strategies, and aggregated visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>: Organizations have progressed further along the maturity journey including centralized identity management and integrated policy enforcement across all pillars. Organizations build towards enterprise-wide visibility including near real time risk and posture assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimal</strong>: Organizations have fully automated lifecycle management implementing dynamic just-enough access (JEA) with just-in-time (JIT) controls for access to organization resources. Organizations implement continuous monitoring with centralized visibility. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft’s Zero Trust Maturity Model guidance serves as a reference for <em>how</em> government organizations should address key aspects of pillar-specific functions for each pillar, across each stage of implementation maturity, using Microsoft cloud services. Microsoft product teams and security architects supporting government organizations worked in close partnership to provide succinct, actionable guidance that aligns with the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model and is organized by pillar, function, and maturity stage, with product guidance including linked references.</p>
<p>The guidance focuses on features available now (including public preview) in Microsoft commercial clouds. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, Microsoft will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our government customers. We’ve already launched more features aligned to the principles of Zero Trust—including Microsoft Security Exposure Management (MSEM) and more. Look for updates and announcements in the Microsoft Security Blog and check Microsoft Learn for Zero Trust guidance for Government customers to stay up to date with the latest information.</p>
