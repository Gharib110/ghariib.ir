<p>In this blog post, we’ll dive into the following key points about rooting/jailbreaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this practice a significant threat for enterprises</li>
<li>How dynamic this matter is and why keeping up at this game is of paramount importance</li>
<li>How Zimperium’s unique technology allows for instant detection of these tools (and new ones) ensuring our customers stay secure</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="is-rooting-still-a-threat">Is rooting still a threat?</h4>
<h2 id="what-is-rooting">What is Rooting?</h2>
<p>Rooting is the process of gaining privileged access (or root access) to the Android operating system; analogous to superuser permissions in Linux or macOS. This allows users to modify system files, install specialized apps, and/or remove carrier/manufacturer restrictions; actions that would typically be off-limits in standard Android environments. Moreover, an advanced user can leverage a rooted device to reverse engineer installed applications.</p>
<h2 id="rooting-vs-jailbreaking">Rooting vs Jailbreaking</h2>
<p>While similar in principle, rooting and jailbreaking target different operating systems and functionalities. Rooting is typically an Android-specific procedure that focuses on gaining root access to allow deep system modifications. Jailbreaking, on the other hand, applies to iOS devices and encompasses broader objectives like bypassing Apple’s locked bootloader, enabling sideloading of non-approved apps and gaining administrative access. Although both allow elevated permissions, Android users have native support for sideloading apps while iOS users don’t. </p>
<p>As we’ll see next, rooted devices present hazardous usage patterns much more frequently than stock devices, so having these devices onboard isn’t cost free.  </p>
<h2 id="some-insights-from-our-data">Some insights from our data…</h2>
<p>Our analysis shows that rooted devices represent 0.1% of our total customer device base (figure 1).</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.zimperium.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>


<strong>Figure 1.</strong> Rooting percentage by OS</p>
<p>Breaking this down by platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android: 1 in 400 devices (0.25%) is rooted</li>
<li>iOS: 1 in 2,500 devices (0.04%) is jailbroken </li>
</ul>
<p>Although there seems to be a particular emphasis on the United States and Malaysia, our data suggests that these devices can be found everywhere. Figure 2 gives a picture of how widely-spread rooted devices are all over the globe. </p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeJofdkWbhuELC60P6P0W83F6gyqRKLMYZtrrLz7usyutWgnZ9jXR1g3ff6moLcPgObFhcanSIjhOSeH-2UT-iYkozXXA9JqA-lfiD6SjU9H3BIXZMSuDcXbglC5MFbf4GrtQG_fw?key=71iFloVfzt6yxGxOWWqGhA" alt="" />

<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Rooting / jailbreaking reports from our customers over the last two years.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows a comparison between the threats reported by stock and rooted devices over a 1-year period. This exhibits, at a broad level, the proportion by which the latter are more exposed to risk. </p>
<p>

</figure>


<strong>Figure 3.</strong> Threats reported by rooted devices (red) vs stock devices (blue).</p>
<p>According to our data, the exposure factor of rooted devices versus stock devices varies from 3x to ~3000x, which suggests that rooted devices are potentially much more vulnerable to threats than stock devices. In other words, much riskier. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malware</strong> attacks occur <strong>3.5 times</strong> more frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Compromised app</strong> detections surge by a <strong>factor of 12</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>System compromise</strong> incidents are <strong>250 times</strong> higher.</li>
<li><strong>Filesystem compromise</strong> events increase by a <strong>factor of 3000</strong>.</li>
<li>Events where <strong>Security-Enhanced Linux</strong> is disabled <strong>increase more than 90 times</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings demonstrate the severe security risks of using rooted or jailbroken devices in enterprise environments. Figure 4 illustrates this idea, showing a case of a rooted device that ended with a full compromise after sideloading malicious applications. </p>

<h2 id="the-rooting-toolkit-guide-to-the-galaxy">The Rooting Toolkit Guide To The Galaxy</h2>
<p>Rooting toolkits continue to evolve, providing users with powerful frameworks to gain elevated control over their devices. In this section, we will explore some of the most prominent rooting tools observed in the wild and examine the key factors that contribute to their widespread use.</p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<h4 id="magisk"><a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a></h4>
<p><em>Magisk</em> is one of the most popular rooting tools for Android, known for its “systemless” rooting method, which means it doesn’t modify the actual system partition but creates changes in a way that’s more concealed from apps and the OS. Latest versions of this tool allow users to gain root access without affecting OTA (over-the-air) updates and retain compatibility with apps that use Play Integrity, Google’s security check for rooted devices. Its popularity stems from its Magisk Modules, which offer various customization options and its ability to mask root status from apps that typically block rooted devices. One of the most popular modules for Magisk is Zygisk (its Zygote injection framework) which enables powerful runtime modifications. Its exploitation technique primarily relies on boot image manipulation and custom init scripts.</p>
<h4 id="apatch"><a href="https://github.com/bmax121/APatch">APatch</a></h4>
<p><em>APatch</em> distinguishes itself by using kernel hot-patching techniques that don’t require boot image modification, making it more stealthy than traditional rooting methods. Its exploitation approach focuses on runtime kernel memory modifications, allowing for dynamic system modifications without permanent changes. Users particularly appreciate its ability to maintain device firmware integrity while still providing root access, and its compatibility with Zygisk modules makes it an attractive alternative to Magisk for users seeking a more kernel-level approach.</p>
<h4 id="kernelsu"><a href="https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU">KernelSU</a></h4>
<p>This tool is focused on Android kernels, providing root access by modifying the Linux kernel layer rather than the user or system partitions. By integrating root functions directly into the kernel, KernelSU can provide more stable performance and potentially enhanced security for advanced users who are comfortable managing kernel configurations. It’s favored for its advanced customization potential and is particularly popular among developers and users interested in deep-level device modifications.</p>
<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>
<h4 id="dopamine"><a href="https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine">Dopamine</a></h4>
<p>Dopamine gained popularity through its modern approach to jailbreaking, utilizing a CoreTrust bypass and implementing a rootless design that maintains much of iOS’s native security architecture. Its exploitation chain combines kernel exploits with careful Page Protection Layer bypasses, making it more stable than previous jailbreaks. Users favor it for its balance of stability and functionality, particularly on newer devices, while maintaining important security features of iOS.</p>
<h4 id="checkra1n"><a href="https://checkra.in/">Checkra1n</a></h4>
<p><em>Checkra1n</em> is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool designed over a hardware-based exploit called “checkm8” (CVE-2019-8900). This exploit targets vulnerabilities in Apple’s bootrom, making it effective for older Apple devices (primarily those up to the iPhone X) that are permanently vulnerable. Checkra1n’s popularity comes from its reliability and longevity since Apple cannot patch the bootrom exploit via software updates, making it a valuable tool for persistent jailbreaking on compatible devices.</p>
<h4 id="roothide"><a href="https://github.com/roothide/Dopamine-roothide">Roothide</a></h4>
<p>Roothide (now known as Rootify) focuses on stealth and stability through its KFD (Kernel File Descriptor) exploit-based approach. Its exploitation technique centers on sophisticated kernel memory manipulation and process hiding, making it particularly effective at evading detection. The tool’s popularity stems from its reliability on newer iOS versions and devices, combined with its emphasis on maintaining system stability while providing comprehensive jailbreak features. Users particularly appreciate its focus on preserving device functionality while maintaining the jailbreak.</p>
<p>Table 1 (below) gives a comprehensive summary of the most frequently used rooting tools in the industry. It is worth mentioning that most of these frameworks offer add-ons or modules to implement their detection evasion mechanisms.</p>

<strong>Table 1.</strong> Current rooting tools overview.</p>
<p>Figure 5 splits out our data between Android and iOS users. It can be seen that for some rooting tools (Apatch, Magisk, Dopamine) there’s been a ramp up in detections in recent months., This upward trend underscores the importance of closely monitoring these evolving threats.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="the-cat-and-mouse-game">The Cat and Mouse Game</h2>
<p>Rooting tools have been around for quite some time now. Since Android first came out in 2008, a rooting community was born with the sole objective of giving the end user more control over their device. Many rooting frameworks became available from that time until2016, when manufacturers and security vendors started striving to detect the presence of these types of tools. That’s where Magisk comes into play, and quickly becomes a sensation with its “systemless root”, allowing users to modify their devices without changing the system partition. This approach allowed root to persist even after system updates while avoiding security checks like Android’s Play Integrity. This shift in strategy marked a turning point, as rooting was no longer just about gaining elevated privileges—it became a battle of stealth, where tools like Magisk had to evolve to remain undetected while maintaining persistent control over the device.</p>
<h2 id="riding-the-wave-the-ever-evolving-ecosystem-of-modern-rooting-frameworks">Riding the Wave: The Ever-Evolving Ecosystem of Modern Rooting Frameworks</h2>
<p>As seen next, the innovation landscape for rooting technologies is quite vast and dynamic. Lots of contributors around the world chip in constantly, providing new ideas and algorithms to improve the rooting mechanisms.</p>
<p>

<strong>Figure 6.</strong> Number of forks over the last two years for the most prominent frameworks. </p>
<p>Figure 6 tracks the number of new forks created over time for several of the major rooting and jailbreak frameworks. The data reveals interesting development patterns in the community. Magisk shows consistent developer interest with a steady baseline of new forks (150-300 monthly), indicating ongoing community engagement. More revealing are the sharp spikes in activity: KernelSU experienced a surge of nearly 500 new forks in mid-2023, while Roothide saw two significant waves of developer interest, peaking at around 400 new forks in early 2024 (coinciding with Roothide’s initial public release as a promising root solution for iOS 16 and 17) and an even larger spike of nearly 600 new forks in late 2024. These sudden increases in forking activity often coincide with major framework updates or with increased security measures in Android/iOS, demonstrating how quickly the development community mobilizes to maintain and adapt these tools. Meanwhile, frameworks like APatch, Dopamine, and Palera1n maintain lower but persistent levels of new development activity, typically generating under 100 new forks per month.</p>
<p>The dynamic nature of rooting tools, evidenced by the intense development activity shown in Figure 6, adds another layer of complexity to the detection challenge. <strong>Each spike in development activity, potentially represents new evasion techniques and countermeasures being developed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-detection-fingerprinting-rooting-tools">Beyond Detection: Fingerprinting Rooting Tools</h2>
<p>While identifying rooted or jailbroken devices presents a significant technical challenge, the Zimperium security framework goes a step further by pinpointing the specific rooting tool in use. This is particularly challenging as concealment is a core feature of these tools —they are specifically engineered to evade detection.</p>
<p>As we see in figures 7 and 8, the development lifecycle of these tools is highly dynamic and rapidly evolving so this never-ending pursuit is constantly being played between security vendors’ development teams and the end-users’ development community. New frameworks come and go while others adapt to stay in the game. As detection technologies improve, so do the hiding mechanisms of these tools. Development teams for these frameworks are highly collaborative, with many contributors from all over the world putting their grain of salt to come up with the most innovative and out-of-the box solutions. Some of the development communities behind these frameworks push many minor releases per month and major releases no more than a few months apart. </p>

<strong>Table 2.</strong> Average time between minor and major releases for some of the most prominent frameworks.</p>
<p>Despite this cat-and-mouse game, our analysis has successfully mapped the footprints of various tools across our user base, enabling us to identify not just the modified devices, but also the specific methods used to achieve root access.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Rooting and jailbreaking remain a serious threat to enterprise security. These practices grant users privileged access to their device’s operating system, opening the door to a host of security risks—including malware infections, compromised apps, and full system takeovers. A single compromised device can serve as the entry point for a much larger attack, putting an entire organization at risk.</p>
<p>What makes this challenge even more pressing is the ever-evolving nature of rooting tools. This isn’t a static threat; tools like Magisk, APatch, KernelSU, Dopamine, Checkra1n, and Roothide are in constant development, with new versions and techniques emerging regularly to bypass security measures. Keeping up with these changes is critical, and that’s exactly where Zimperium’s zLabs team excels.
