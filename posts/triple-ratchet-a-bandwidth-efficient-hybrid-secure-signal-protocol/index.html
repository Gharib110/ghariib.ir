				<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Triple Ratchet: A Bandwidth Efficient Hybrid-Secure Signal Protocol</strong><br>
<em>Yevgeniy Dodis, Daniel Jost, Shuichi Katsumata, Thomas Prest, Rolfe Schmidt</em></p>
<p>Secure Messaging apps have seen growing adoption, and are used by billions of people daily. However, due to imminent threat of a &ldquo;Harvest Now, Decrypt Later&rdquo; attack, secure messaging providers must react know in order to make their protocols $textit{hybrid-secure}$: at least as secure as before, but now also post-quantum (PQ) secure. Since many of these apps are internally based on the famous Signal&rsquo;s Double-Ratchet (DR) protocol, making Signal hybrid-secure is of great importance.</p>
<p>In fact, Signal and Apple already put in production various Signal-based variants with certain levels of hybrid security: PQXDH (only on the initial handshake), and PQ3 (on the entire protocol), by adding a $textit{PQ-ratchet}$ to the DR protocol. Unfortunately, due to the large communication overheads of the $mathsf{Kyber}$ scheme used by PQ3, real-world PQ3 performs this PQ-ratchet approximately every 50 messages. As we observe, the effectiveness of this amortization, while reasonable in the best-case communication scenario, quickly deteriorates in other still realistic scenarios; causing $textit{many consecutive}$ (rather than $1$ in $50$) re-transmissions of the same $mathsf{Kyber}$ public keys and ciphertexts (of combined size 2272 bytes!).</p>
<p>In this work we design a new Signal-based, hybrid-secure secure messaging protocol, which significantly reduces the communication complexity of PQ3. We call our protocol &ldquo;the $textit{Triple Ratchet}$&rdquo; (TR) protocol. First, TR uses $textit{em erasure codes}$ to make the communication inside the PQ-ratchet provably balanced. This results in much better $textit{worst-case}$ communication guarantees of TR, as compared to PQ3. Second, we design a novel &ldquo;variant&rdquo; of $mathsf{Kyber}$, called $mathsf{Katana}$, with significantly smaller combined length of ciphertext and public key (which is the relevant efficiency measure for &ldquo;PQ-secure ratchets&rdquo;). For 192 bits of security, $mathsf{Katana}$ improves this key efficiency measure by over 37%: from 2272 to 1416 bytes. In doing so, we identify a critical security flaw in prior suggestions to optimize communication complexity of lattice-based PQ-ratchets, and fix this flaw with a novel proof relying on the recently introduced hint MLWE assumption.</p>
<p>During the development of this work we have been in discussion with the Signal team, and they are actively evaluating bringing a variant of it into production in a future iteration of the Signal protocol.</p>
