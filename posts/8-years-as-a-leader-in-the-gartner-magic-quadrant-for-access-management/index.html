				<p>In mid-October, we released our 2024 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, which revealed over 600 million identity attacks per day. As multifactor authentication now blocks most password-based attacks, we’re seeing a shift in threat actor tactics and a convergence of nation-state and cybercriminal threat activity. More than 99% of identity attacks are password attacks—often due to predictable human behaviors like easy-to-guess passwords, password reuse, and falling prey to phishing attacks.1 That’s why comprehensive, integrated identity and access management (IAM) should be a core part of any organization’s threat-informed defense. Today we’re honored to announce that for the eighth year in a row, Microsoft has been named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management—placed highest on the Ability to Execute axis. </p>
<h2 id="delivering-on-identity-and-access-management-for-customers">Delivering on identity and access management for customers</h2>
<p>We believe our 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ recognition validates our commitment to delivering a comprehensive, AI-powered and automated identity portfolio to customers, with Microsoft Entra. It empowers customers to protect their digital everything with a simplified user experience that makes identity and access management (IAM) easier than ever before. And it’s informed by our customers and partners—to whom we thank and share this honor.</p>

<h2 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h2>
<p>As we celebrate this year’s recognition, we’re also hard at work on new and expanded features—looking ahead to meet customers’ changing IAM needs as our collective threat landscape continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID currently supports <strong>device-bound passkeys</strong> stored on FIDO2 security keys and in Microsoft Authenticator. And we’re investing in both synced and device-bound passkeys for work accounts. For enterprises that use passwords today, passkeys provide a seamless way for workers to authenticate without entering a username or password. Passkeys provide improved productivity for workers and have better security. Read more about requirements and instructions to enable passkeys for your organization. </p>
