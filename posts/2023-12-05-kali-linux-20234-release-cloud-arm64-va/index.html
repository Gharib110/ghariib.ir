<p>With 2023 coming to an end and before the holiday season starts, we thought today would be a good time to <a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release</a> <strong>Kali 2023.4</strong>. Whilst this release may not have the most end-user features in it again, there are a number of new platform offerings and there has still been a lot of changes going on behind-the-scenes for us, which has a positive knock-on effect resulting in a benefit for everyone. News, platforms, and features aside, it would not be a Kali release if there was not a number of changes to our packages - both new tools and upgrades to existing ones. If you want to see what is new for yourself <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download</a> a new image or <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">upgrade <em>if you already have a Kali Linux installation</em></a>.</p>
<p>The summary of the <a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">changelog</a> since the <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-3-release/">2023.3 release from August</a> is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/#cloud-arm-marketplaces">Cloud ARM64</a></strong> - Now Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure marketplaces have an ARM64 option</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/#vagrant-hyper-v-support">Vagrant Hyper-V</a></strong> - Our Vagrant offering now supports Hyper-V</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/#raspberry-pi-5">Raspberry Pi 5</a></strong> - Kali on the latest Raspberry Pi foundation device</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/#gnome-45">GNOME 45</a></strong> - Kali theme is on the latest versions</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/#internal-infrastructure">Internal Infrastructure</a></strong> - Peak at what is going on behind the scenes with mirrorbits</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/#new-tools-in-kali">New Tools</a></strong> - As always, various new &amp; updated packages</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="cloud-arm64-marketplaces">Cloud ARM64 Marketplaces</h2>
<p>Starting from Kali 2023.4, we will now be offering both Kali Linux AMD64 and ARM64 on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=3fd16b5c-a3f6-43b5-b254-0a6ae8f6a350">Amazon AWS</a> and <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en/marketplace/apps/kali-linux.kali?tab=overview">Microsoft Azure</a> marketplaces.</p>
<p>The advantage that ARM64 brings to the table is more options and flexibility in instance offerings, which leads to improved price-to-performance ratio. The draw back is, even though Kali Linux has always treated ARM a first class citizen, not every package has an ARM64 offering - most do and we are working on improving this every day! Try setting up a lab in the cloud and performing your own benchmarks to compare performances.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon AWS</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fznsw3f7mq7to">Kali Linux (AMD64)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-kie6xvt5r3spi">Kali Linux (ARM64)</a></li>

<p>If you need some help using Kali Linux in the cloud, be sure to check our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/cloud/">documentation</a>. Otherwise, if you want to see how we generate these images, see our <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-cloud">cloud build-scripts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="vagrant-hyper-v-support">Vagrant Hyper-V Support</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-2-release/#new-hyper-v-vm-image">our recent work</a> with adding support to our <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-vm">VM build-scripts</a> to create Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines, we have kept on going down the rabbit hole of development. <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling">Our Vagrant offering</a> now includes a Hyper-V environment!</p>
<p>If you are not too familiar with Vagrant, think of it as a command-line interface for VMware, VirtualBox, and now Hyper-V.</p>
<p>At a higher level, in the same way that Docker uses <code>Dockerfile</code>, Vagrant uses <code>Vagrantfile</code>. These files go on to define how to create the virtual machine and further provisions, such as which operating system to use, CPU, RAM, storage, networking, and also any scripts or commands that the VM should execute to further install and configure.</p>
<p>That means our <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling">our Vagrant offering</a> has support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyper-V</li>
<li>QEMU</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMware</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is something you like the sound of, we have further reading on our documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/customizing-kali-vagrant/">Customizing a Kali Vagrant Vagrantfile</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vagrant-guest-vm/">Kali inside Vagrant (Guest VM)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We also have our <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-vagrant">vagrant build-scripts</a> public if you want to see how it is done.</p>
<h2 id="raspberry-pi-5">Raspberry Pi 5</h2>
<p>If you have been lucky enough to get your hands on the newest Raspberry Pi, Kali Linux can now be used on a Raspberry Pi 5!</p>
<p>We have created a new dedicated image which can either be <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm">downloaded direct</a>, or automated using <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/using-rpi-imager-to-write-raspberry-pi-images/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">build the image yourself</a> if you wish to tinker and customize any aspect of it, such as changing the default desktop environment, packages, settings etc.</p>
<p>Please note, Nexmon support is not yet working with the in-built Wi-Fi (so no monitor mode or frame injection without an external card).</p>
<p>You can keep an eye on progress by checking our <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-5/">documentation</a> about it. Please keep in mind that while the image is now available for use, we would consider it to be in a BETA state. For the time being, the image is for ARM64 architecture, hopefully additional flavors will come later.</p>
<p>We want to give a huge shout-out as there were a lot of volunteers from the community who were willing to test and report issues with the image. There was one person who really stood out, and this image would not be possible without <code>BakaValen</code>’s assistance, support, reporting of issues, and ideas.</p>
<p>Additionally, David Bombal’s <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=paN5F1EmjfA">Raspberry Pi 5 Kali Linux install in 10 minutes</a> came out to show off our initial work of Kali Linux on the Raspberry Pi 5.</p>
<h2 id="gnome-45">GNOME 45</h2>
<p>With <strong>GNOME 45</strong> hot off the press, Kali Linux is now supporting it! And is looking pretty in the process!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2023-4-release/images/gnome-45.png">

</a></p>
<p>For people who opt to use GNOME as their desktop environment, <strong><a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/">GNOME 45</a></strong> is now here! If you do not read their changelog, below is a quick summary mixed with some of our tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-height sidebars in many updated apps</li>
<li>Highly <strong>improved speed of search in nautilus file manager</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately the update for <code>nautilus</code> was not ready for this release, but it will arrive as a later update soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improved settings</strong> app (<code>gnome-control-center</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Updated color-schemes</strong> for <code>gnome-text-editor</code></li>
<li><strong>Updated themes</strong> for <code>shell</code>, <code>libadwaita</code>, <code>gtk-3</code> and <code>gtk-4</code></li>
<li><strong>Updated <code>gnome-shell</code> extensions</strong></li>
<li>Shell updates, including a new <strong>workspace indicator</strong>, replacing the previous “Activities” button
<ul>
<li>It is also possible to scroll your mouse wheel while hovering over the indicator to switch between workspaces</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="internal-infrastructure">Internal Infrastructure</h2>
<p>We are still undergoing big changes with our infrastructure, and as always, it is taking longer than planned! The wait has been worth it, and long standing items are getting fixed or replaced!</p>
<h3 id="enters-mirrorbits">Enters Mirrorbits</h3>
<p>One of the projects which is now complete is the migration of our “mirror redirector”. This is our biggest user-facing service, as without this, all default Kali installations would not be able to use <code>apt</code> (aka <code>http.kali.org</code>), or being able to download Kali image (<code>cdimage.kali.org</code>). This service sits in-front of our mirrors (<code>archive*.kali.org</code>), <a href="https://http.kali.org/README?mirrorlist">community mirrors</a> and Cloudflare (<code>kali.download</code>). It is responsible for redirecting every request to its nearest mirror, based on a few factors such as geographic location, mirror speed, and <a href="https://mirror-traces.kali.org/">mirror “freshness”</a>.</p>
<p>Since Kali was launched back in March 2013, until November 2023 we had been using <a href="https://mirrorbrain.org/">MirrorBrain</a>. Unfortunately, the project has been unmaintained since 2015, and so after 10 years in production, it was really time to say good-bye. Today, we are now using <a href="https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits">Mirrorbits</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing we can say is that, with Mirrorbits, we find ourselves lucky: this is a rock-solid piece of software, built on modern tech (Go and Redis), initially released 10 years ago, and running in production for just as long. It was initially developed by <a href="https://blog.l0cal.com/">Ludovic Fauvet</a> from VideoLAN in order to distribute the VLC media player. And over these years, it has been adopted by a growing number of FOSS projects such as GNOME, Jenkins, Lineage OS, and many others.</p>
<p>As it happens, our use-case of Mirrorbits is different to what it was originally created for: distributing VLC, or in other words, a rather small set of static files. Kali Linux being a <em>complete Linux distribution</em>, it means that we distribute a huge number of files (at times there can be millions of files in our repo). Being a <em>rolling distribution</em> means that Mirrorbits must cope with fast-changing metadata in the repository. We also need to distribute Kali over both HTTP and HTTPS, which was not well supported.</p>
<p>Thus, the transition to Mirrorbits was not trivial, it did not work “out-of-the-box” for us, and we had to rework some pieces here and there, and basically hammer at it until it does the job. But it was well worth it, and in the end our modifications were clean enough that we could submit it all <a href="https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits">upstream</a>. We really hope that all of this work will be accepted, thus making it easier for Linux distributions in general to use Mirrorbits going forward. Oh, and we have created and are maintaining the <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mirrorbits">Debian package</a>!</p>
<p>Much more could be written on the topic, and we plan a longer blog post dedicated to it. But for now, enough’s been said.</p>
