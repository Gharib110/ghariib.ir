				<p>Good news for growing businesses and folks with data-intensive applications: we’re excited to introduce 100% larger storage plans for both Managed MySQL and PostgreSQL in select regions. Starting today, Managed MySQL storage has doubled to 20TB, and Managed PostgreSQL now supports up to 30TB, up from 15TB. These expanded storage options are available in Singapore (SGP1), San Francisco (SFO2), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with plans to roll out to more regions later this year.</p>
<p>Now users have even more flexibility to scale seamlessly, whether growing existing workloads or migrating from self-managed databases. With DigitalOcean’s fully managed service, you get the performance, security, and simplicity you need—without the operational burden. Scaling your databases is now easier than ever, helping to ensure your infrastructure keeps pace with your business growth.</p>
<h1 id="why-larger-plan-sizes-matter">Why larger plan sizes matter</h1>
<p>As your businesses grow, so do data storage requirements. Our expanded, scalable storage options allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Big databases, no worries:</strong> Support large databases with up to <strong>20TB</strong> and <strong>30TB</strong> of scalable storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control both performance and costs:</strong> Scale storage independently of CPU and memory, giving you the flexibility to adapt as your workload evolves. This ensures you pay only for what you need while avoiding over- or under-provisioning resources.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Migrate like magic:</strong> Move from self-managed databases on Droplets or other cloud providers to <strong>DigitalOcean Managed Databases</strong> without storage constraints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
