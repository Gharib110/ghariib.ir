			<div>
				<p>This post describes <em>Pod failure policy</em>, which graduates to stable in Kubernetes 1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.</p>
<h2 id="about-pod-failure-policy">About Pod failure policy</h2>
<p>When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons. Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable failures and continue running to completion.</p>
<p>To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the <code>backoffLimit</code> field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the <code>backoffLimit</code> field and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.</p>
<p>This becomes particularly problematic when running large-scale Jobs with thousands of long-running Pods across thousands of nodes.</p>
<p>The Pod failure policy extends the backoff limit mechanism to help you reduce costs in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives you control to fail the Job as soon as a non-retriable Pod failure occurs.</li>
<li>Allows you to ignore retriable errors without increasing the <code>backoffLimit</code> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can use a Pod failure policy to run your workload on more affordable spot machines by ignoring Pod failures caused by graceful node shutdown.</p>
<p>The policy allows you to distinguish between retriable and non-retriable Pod failures based on container exit codes or Pod conditions in a failed Pod.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>You specify a Pod failure policy in the Job specification, represented as a list of rules.</p>
<p>For each rule you define <em>match requirements</em> based on one of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Container exit codes: the <code>onExitCodes</code> property.</li>
<li>Pod conditions: the <code>onPodConditions</code> property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, for each rule, you specify one of the following actions to take when a Pod matches the rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ignore</code>: Do not count the failure towards the <code>backoffLimit</code> or <code>backoffLimitPerIndex</code>.</li>
<li><code>FailJob</code>: Fail the entire Job and terminate all running Pods.</li>
<li><code>FailIndex</code>: Fail the index corresponding to the failed Pod. This action works with the Backoff limit per index feature.</li>
<li><code>Count</code>: Count the failure towards the <code>backoffLimit</code> or <code>backoffLimitPerIndex</code>. This is the default behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Pod failures occur in a running Job, Kubernetes matches the failed Pod status against the list of Pod failure policy rules, in the specified order, and takes the corresponding actions for the first matched rule.</p>
<p>Note that when specifying the Pod failure policy, you must also set the Job&rsquo;s Pod template with <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>. This prevents race conditions between the kubelet and the Job controller when counting Pod failures.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-initiated-pod-disruptions">Kubernetes-initiated Pod disruptions</h3>
<p>To allow matching Pod failure policy rules against failures caused by disruptions initiated by Kubernetes, this feature introduces the <code>DisruptionTarget</code> Pod condition.</p>
<p>Kubernetes adds this condition to any Pod, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s managed by a Job controller, that fails because of a retriable disruption scenario. The <code>DisruptionTarget</code> condition contains one of the following reasons that corresponds to these disruption scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PreemptionByKubeScheduler</code>: Preemption by <code>kube-scheduler</code> to accommodate a new Pod that has a higher priority.</li>
<li><code>DeletionByTaintManager</code> - the Pod is due to be deleted by <code>kube-controller-manager</code> due to a <code>NoExecute</code> taint that the Pod doesn&rsquo;t tolerate.</li>
<li><code>EvictionByEvictionAPI</code> - the Pod is due to be deleted by an API-initiated eviction.</li>
<li><code>DeletionByPodGC</code> - the Pod is bound to a node that no longer exists, and is due to be deleted by Pod garbage collection.</li>
<li><code>TerminationByKubelet</code> - the Pod was terminated by graceful node shutdown, node pressure eviction or preemption for system critical pods.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other disruption scenarios, like eviction due to exceeding Pod container limits, Pods don&rsquo;t receive the <code>DisruptionTarget</code> condition because the disruptions were likely caused by the Pod and would reoccur on retry.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>The Pod failure policy snippet below demonstrates an example use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">podFailurePolicy</span>:

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> - <span style="color:#f92672">action</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">FailJob</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">onPodConditions</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> - <span style="color:#f92672">type</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">ConfigIssue</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> - <span style="color:#f92672">action</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">FailJob</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">onExitCodes</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">operator</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">In</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">values</span>: [ <span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span> ]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the Pod failure policy does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignores any failed Pods that have the built-in <code>DisruptionTarget</code> condition. These Pods don&rsquo;t count towards Job backoff limits.</li>
<li>Fails the Job if any failed Pods have the custom user-supplied <code>ConfigIssue</code> condition, which was added either by a custom controller or webhook.</li>
<li>Fails the Job if any containers exited with the exit code 42.</li>
<li>Counts all other Pod failures towards the default <code>backoffLimit</code> (or <code>backoffLimitPerIndex</code> if used).</li>
