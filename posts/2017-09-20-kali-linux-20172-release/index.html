<p>We are happy to announce the release of Kali Linux 2017.2, <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">available now</a> for your downloading pleasure. This release is a roll-up of all updates and fixes since our <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-1-release/">2017.1 release</a> in April. In tangible terms, if you were to install Kali from your 2017.1 ISO, after logging in to the desktop and running ‘apt update &amp;&amp; apt full-upgrade’, you would be faced with something similiar to this daunting message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain"><span style="display:flex;"><span>1399 upgraded, 171 newly installed, 16 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Need to get 1,477 MB of archives.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>After this operation, 1,231 MB of additional disk space will be used.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That would make for a whole lot of downloading, unpacking, and configuring of packages. Naturally, these numbers don’t tell the entire tale so read on to see what’s new in this release.</p>
<h3 id="new-and-updated-packages-in-kali-20172">New and Updated Packages in Kali 2017.2</h3>

<h3 id="ongoing-integration-improvements">Ongoing Integration Improvements</h3>
<p>Beyond the new and updated packages in this release, we have also been working towards improving the overall integration of packages in Kali Linux. One area in particular is in program usage examples. Many program authors assume that their application will only be run in a certain manner or from a certain location. For example, the SMBmap application has a binary name of ‘smbmap’ but if you were to look at the usage example, you would see this:</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ python smbmap.py -u jsmith -p password1 -d workgroup -H 192.168.0.1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ python smbmap.py -u jsmith -p <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:da76f2c4c96028b7a6111aef4a50a94d&#39;</span> -H 172.16.0.20
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ python smbmap.py -u <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;apadmin&#39;</span> -p <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;asdf1234!&#39;</span> -d ACME -h 10.1.3.30 -x <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;net group &#34;Domain Admins&#34; /domain&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you were a novice user, you might see these examples, try to run them verbatim, find that they don’t work, assume the tool doesn’t work, and move on. That would be a shame because smbmap is an excellent program so we have been working on fixing these usage discrepancies to help improve the overall fit and finish of the distribution. If you run ‘smbmap’ in Kali 2017.2, you will now see this output instead:</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ smbmap -u jsmith -p password1 -d workgroup -H 192.168.0.1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ smbmap -u jsmith -p <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:da76f2c4c96028b7a6111aef4a50a94d&#39;</span> -H 172.16.0.20
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ smbmap -u <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;apadmin&#39;</span> -p <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;asdf1234!&#39;</span> -d ACME -h 10.1.3.30 -x <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;net group &#34;Domain Admins&#34; /domain&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We hope that small tweaks like these will help reduce confusion to both veterans and newcomers and it’s something we will continue working towards as time goes on.</p>
<h3 id="learn-more-about-kali-linux">Learn More About Kali Linux</h3>

If you are interested in going far beyond the basics, really want to learn how Kali Linux works, and how you can leverage its many advanced features, we encourage you to check it out.

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>apt update

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>reboot
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We hope you enjoy this fine release as much as we enjoyed making it!</p>
