				<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, incident response, and business continuity planning, preparedness is key. In today’s environment, where breaches and disruptions are inevitable, organizations cannot afford to operate with untested protocols or vague plans. This is where <strong>tabletop exercises</strong> come in—providing a structured, scenario-based approach to testing and refining an organization’s readiness for real-world crises.</p>
