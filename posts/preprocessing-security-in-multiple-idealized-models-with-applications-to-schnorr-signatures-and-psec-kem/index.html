				<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Preprocessing Security in Multiple Idealized Models with Applications to Schnorr Signatures and PSEC-KEM</strong><br>
<em>Jeremiah Blocki, Seunghoon Lee</em></p>
<p>In modern cryptography, relatively few instantiations of foundational cryptographic primitives are used across most cryptographic protocols. For example, elliptic curve groups are typically instantiated using P-256, P-384, Curve25519, or Curve448, while block ciphers are commonly instantiated with AES, and hash functions with SHA-2, SHA-3, or SHAKE. This limited diversity raises concerns that an adversary with nation-state-level resources could perform a preprocessing attack, generating a hint that might later be exploited to break protocols built on these primitives. It is often notoriously challenging to analyze and upper bound the advantage of a preprocessing attacker even if we assume that we have idealized instantiations of our cryptographic primitives (ideal permutations, ideal ciphers, random oracles, generic groups). Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18) demonstrated a powerful framework to simplify the analysis of preprocessing attacks, but they only proved that their framework applies when the cryptographic protocol uses a single idealized primitive. In practice, however, cryptographic constructions often utilize multiple different cryptographic primitives.</p>
<p>We verify that Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18)&rsquo;s framework extends to settings with multiple idealized primitives and we apply this framework to analyze the multi-user security of (short) Schnorr Signatures and the CCA-security of PSEC-KEM against pre-processing attackers in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) plus the Generic Group Model (GGM). Prior work of Blocki and Lee (EUROCRYPT'22) used complicated compression arguments to analyze the security of {em key-prefixed} short Schnorr signatures where the random oracle is salted with the user&rsquo;s public key. However, the security analysis did not extend to standardized implementations of Schnorr Signatures (e.g., BSI-TR-03111 or ISO/IEC 14888-3) which do not adopt key-prefixing, but take other measures to protect against preprocessing attacks by disallowing signatures that use a preimage of $0$. Blocki and Lee (EUROCRYPT'22) left the (in)security of such &ldquo;nonzero Schnorr Signature&rdquo; constructions as an open question. We fully resolve this open question demonstrating that (short) nonzero Schnorr Signatures are also secure against preprocessing attacks. We also analyze PSEC-KEM in the ROM+GGM demonstrating that this Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is CPA-secure against preprocessing attacks.</p>
