				<p>Unfortunately, when your devices are infected with a virus, it’s not as easy as a little bed rest for them to recover, and the damage can be long-lasting. A cyberattack can compromise your computers, phones and tablets, and open the door for cyber thieves to steal your sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>According to a study by the University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering, there is a cyberattack approximately every 39 seconds. The most common form of cyberattack is malware, a type of software that’s used to break into your computer system. Last year alone, there were more than 6 billion malware attacks detected worldwide. Some of the many forms of malware include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Prevents you from accessing your files, devices or network unless you pay money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly monitors your online behavior and shares your personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keylogger:</strong> Records your keystrokes as you type, then sends sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers to hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan:</strong> Disguises itself as legitimate files to monitor your online activity and steal sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Computer virus</strong>: Infects files and hard drives and spreads from device to device, damaging and destroying data and software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adware:</strong> Installs itself on your device and displays unwanted online advertisements and pop-ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cryptojacking:</strong> Hides on your device and steals its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Malware can affect any device with computing capability and it’s commonly spread through email attachments. If malware goes undetected, your devices can become locked or unstable. Here are some telltale signs that your phone, tablet or computer may have been infected with malware:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sudden slowdowns, repeated crashes or error messages that won’t shut down or restart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will not let you remove software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequent pop-ups, inappropriate ads or ads that interfere with page content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New toolbars or icons in your browser or on your desktop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New default search engine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New tabs or websites you didn’t open</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends emails you didn’t write</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Runs out of battery more quickly than it should</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ransomware is one of the most common forms of malware, and the costliest. Cyber Security Ventures predicts by 2031 a new ransomware attack will occur every 2 seconds, costing its victims nearly $265 billion.  These attacks are aimed at consumers, small businesses and enterprises.  Last year, there were a record number of ransomware attacks impacting consumer data at high-profile organizations such as Bank of America, Rite Aid, and MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>So how do we protect ourselves from this type of cybercrime? Here are a few tips for protecting your devices and information from malware attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Update your devices regularly to get the latest security patches. Most updates are easy to install and can be setup to update automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use antivirus software like Webroot Premium to protect all your devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t visit suspicious websites, just block them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t click on web pop-ups and consider using a pop-up blocker. Webroot’s Web Threat Shield detects and blocks malicious websites before you visit them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t open emails, attachments, and click links unless they’re from email addresses you trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t download software unless it is from a website you know and trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use multi-factor authentication. Using more than one form of authentication to access your accounts, make it more difficult for malicious actors to gain access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backup your devices regularly using solutions like Carbonite.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It may not be possible for you to avoid catching a cold now and then, but it is possible to keep your devices safe from threatening viruses. By staying vigilant, you can keep your private information out of the hands of online criminals. Because when it comes to your cyber health, an ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure.</p>
