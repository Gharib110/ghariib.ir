				<p>XWorm refers to a type of malware that has been analyzed for its obfuscation techniques and potential impacts on systems.</p>
<p>While this malware is known for its ability to disguise itself and evade detection which makes it a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
<p>NetSkope researchers recently identified a new variant of XWorm that is delivered via Windows script file.</p>
<p>⁤XWorm is a versatile malware tool that was discovered in “2022,” and since then it has evolved to version 5.6 as recently uncovered by “Netskope Threat Labs.” ⁤</p>
<h2 id="xworm-delivered-via-windows-script"><strong>XWorm Delivered Via Windows Script</strong></h2>
<p>This “.NET-based” threat initiates its infection chain via a “Windows Script File” (‘WSF’), which downloads and executes an obfuscated “PowerShell script” from “paste[.]ee.” ⁤⁤</p>

<p>The script creates multiple files (“VsLabs.vbs,” “VsEnhance.bat,” and “VsLabsData.ps1”) in “C:ProgramDataMusicVisuals” and establishes persistence through a scheduled task named “MicroSoftVisualsUpdater.” ⁤</p>

<p>While besides this, ⁤XWorm employs evasive techniques like “reflective code loading of a DLL loader” (‘NewPE2’) and “process injection into legitimate processes” like ‘RegSvcs.exe.’ ⁤</p>
<p>It communicates with its “command and control (‘C2’) server” via “TCP sockets,” using “AES-ECB encryption” with a modified “MD5 hash” as the key.</p>
<p>Here the new features in v5.6 include the ability to remove plugins and a “Pong” command for response time reporting.</p>

<p>The malware conducts extensive system reconnaissance by collecting data on “hardware,” “software,” and “user privileges.”</p>
<p>Not only that even it also notifies the attackers through ‘Telegram’ upon “successful infection.”</p>
<p>These sophisticated techniques enable “XWorm” to “access sensitive information,” “gain remote access,” and deploy “additional malware” while evading detection.</p>
<p>XWorm employs multiple attack vectors and can modify the host files on infected systems to redirect the DNS requests for malicious purposes.</p>
<p>The malware launches “DDoS” attacks by sending repetitive “POST requests” to target “IP addresses” and “ports.”</p>
<p>XWorm captures ‘screenshots’ using the “CopyFromScreen” function and stores them as “JPEG” images in memory before transmission.</p>
<p>It executes a wide range of commands like “system manipulation” (‘shutdown,’ ‘restart,’ ‘logoff’), “file operations,” and “remote code execution” via PowerShell.</p>
<p>The malware can download and execute additional payloads like “send HTTP requests,” and “persistently install plugins.”</p>
<p>XWorm utilizes a well-defined message format for communication in its back-channel with the C2 server, and often adds the ‘system information’ of the victim as well.</p>
<p>Another feature is ‘process monitoring,’ where certain operations are conducted stealthily by hiding some activities from the user.</p>
<p>This diverse toolkit enables the actors to have a extensive access and control over the systems that have been compromised which makes “XWorm” a significant threat in today’s cybersecurity ecosystem.</p>
