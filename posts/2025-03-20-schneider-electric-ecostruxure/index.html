<h2 id="4-mitigations">4. MITIGATIONS</h2>
<p>Schneider Electric has identified the following specific remediations and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version v4.8.0.5715 of EcoStruxure™ Process Expert 2023 Software Package includes a fix for this vulnerability and is available for <a href="https://www.se.com/au/en/product-range/65406-ecostruxure-processexpert/#software-and-firmware">download.</a></li>
<li>Uninstall Version 2023 (v4.8.0.5115) before installing Version 2023 (v4.8.0.5715). Version string can be found on engineering server console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. Schneider Electric strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/">Customer Care Center</a> for assistance removing a patch.</p>
<p>If users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:</p>
<ul>
<li>EcoStruxure™ Process Expert Versions 2020R2, 2021 &amp; 2023 (prior to v4.8.0.5715): Allow execute permission for service control Windows utility only to admin user. McAfee Application and Change Control software for application control to allow execution of whitelisted applications only. Refer to the <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000004778/">Cybersecurity Application Note.</a></li>
<li>EcoStruxure™ Process Expert for AVEVA System Platform Versions 2020R2, 2021 &amp; 2023: Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all future versions of EcoStruxure™ Process Expert for AVEVA System Platform that will include a fix for this vulnerability. Schneider Electric will update SEVD-2025-042-03 when the remediation is available. Until then, users should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit: Allow only admin users to configure windows service by restricting execute permission of sc.exe windows utility. McAfee Application and Change Control software for application control to allow execution of whitelisted applications only. Refer to the <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000004778/">Cybersecurity Application Note.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Schneider Electric strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.</li>
<li>Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.</li>
<li>Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the &ldquo;Program&rdquo; mode.</li>
<li>Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.</li>
<li>Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.</li>
<li>Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.</li>
<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.</li>
<li>When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>
</ul>
