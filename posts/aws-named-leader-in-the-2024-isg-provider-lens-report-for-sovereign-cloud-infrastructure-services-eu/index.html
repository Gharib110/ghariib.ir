				<p>For the second year in a row, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is named as a Leader in the Information Services Group (ISG) Provider Lens Quadrant report for Sovereign Cloud Infrastructure Services (EU), published on December 18, 2024. ISG is a leading global technology research, analyst, and advisory firm that serves as a trusted business partner to more than 900 clients. This ISG report evaluates 19 providers of sovereign cloud infrastructure services in the multi public cloud environment and examines how they address the key challenges that enterprise clients face in the European Union (EU). ISG defines Leaders as providers who represent innovative strength and competitive stability.</p>
<p>ISG rated AWS ahead of other leading cloud providers on both the competitive strength and portfolio attractiveness axes, with the highest score on portfolio attractiveness. Competitive strength was assessed on multiple factors, including degree of awareness, core competencies, and go-to-market strategy. Portfolio attractiveness was assessed on multiple factors, including scope of portfolio, portfolio quality, strategy and vision, and local characteristics.</p>
<p>According to the ISG Provider Lens report, “AWS develops various innovative solutions to meet different sovereignty needs, guided by inputs from regulators, cybersecurity experts, partners and customers. These solutions address factors such as location, workload sensitivity and industry standards.”</p>

<p>The recognition of AWS as a Leader in this report for the second year in a row is a testament to our efforts to help European customers and partners meet their digital sovereignty and resilience requirements. AWS continues to deliver on the AWS Digital Sovereignty Pledge, our commitment to offering AWS customers the most advanced set of sovereignty controls and features available in the cloud. Earlier this year, we announced plans to invest €7.8 billion in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud by 2040, building on our long-term commitment to Europe and ongoing support of the region’s sovereignty needs. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud, which will be a new, independent cloud for Europe, is set to launch by the end of 2025.</p>
