<p><strong>October 28, 2022:</strong> This blog post has been updated to reflect that CBC has changed to CTR, as well as a few more modifications.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This blog post discusses how you can use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) RSA public keys on end clients or devices and encrypt data, then subsequently decrypt data by using private keys that are secured in AWS KMS.</p>
<p>Asymmetric cryptography is a cryptographic system that uses <em>key pairs</em>. Each pair consists of a public key, which can be seen or accessed by anyone, and a private key, which can be accessed only by authorized people. This system has a useful property, which is that anything encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. A popular method for generating key pairs and encrypting data is the RSA algorithm and cryptosystem.</p>
<p>For RSA key pairs, calculating the private key from the public key is seen as computationally infeasible, and therefore RSA key pairs can be used for both authentication and encryption. The features of asymmetric encryption allow separated parties to share information across an untrusted domain, such as the internet, without having to pre-share any other secrets. However, this type of encryption poses an issue of keeping the private key secure, because the private key has the power to decrypt all messages that are transmitted by a large number of end users.</p>
<p>AWS KMS provides simple APIs that you can use to securely generate, store, and manage keys, including RSA key pairs inside hardware security modules (HSMs). Key pairs are generated within FIPS 140-2 validated HSMs that are managed by AWS. You can then use these private keys through APIs to do actions such as decrypt ciphertexts, meaning that plaintext private keys never leave the HSM, which provides assurances of privacy for the private key. Additional APIs allow a customer to retrieve a plaintext copy of the corresponding public key, which allows disconnected or offline uses of RSA public keys.</p>
<h2 id="limits-of-asymmetric-cryptography">Limits of asymmetric cryptography</h2>
<p>A key drawback to asymmetric cryptography is the fact that you cannot encrypt large pieces of data. When you have a 2048-bit RSA key pair and encrypt something by using the cipher RSAES_OASEP_SHA_256, the largest amount of data that you can encrypt is 190 bytes.</p>
<p>In contrast, symmetric encryption ciphers that use a chained or counter-mode operation don’t have this limit, and they make it possible for you to encrypt data in the tens-of-gigabytes. Symmetric encryption algorithms such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) also benefit from faster data encryption speeds due to smaller key sizes and less complex operations that can be built into hardware.</p>
<p>By combining these two algorithms in a hybrid cryptosystem, you give end clients with a public key the ability to encrypt large pieces of information. A client generates a random 256-bit AES key, which should be from a secure source such as /dev/urandom or a dedicated embedded chip. The client then encrypts its large payload by using a mode of operation such as AES-GCM or AES-CTR by using that 256-bit AES key. Next, the client encrypts that 256-bit AES key by using the RSA public key (see step 5 in Figure 1). End clients then transmit only encrypted data across insecure channels, maintaining privacy of the payload data.</p>
<p>A challenge that customers often face is that they want to use AWS KMS for its security properties, but also want to access their KMS keys from devices that don’t have AWS credentials embedded within them. Without AWS credentials, a device can’t call AWS APIs. This blog post shows how you can use a hybrid cryptosystem where RSA public keys can be downloaded or embedded into devices to overcome this challenge.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-and-initial-considerations">Prerequisites and initial considerations</h2>
<p>This walkthrough assumes that you have some understanding of RSA ciphers and symmetric encryption schemes such as AES. The walkthrough uses OpenSSL for demonstration of the encryption process, but similar libraries can be used on a client-side device.</p>
<p>The walkthrough also assumes that you have an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with permissions to the AWS KMS service, and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed with the relevant credentials.</p>
<p>When you create a KMS key, you will also generate a key policy that defines access to it. The default key policy allows all users in your account with AWS KMS actions in their IAM policies to access the KMS key. The key policy for a given KMS key is the primary method for determining access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: You will incur charges for the services used in this example. You can find the cost of each service on the corresponding service pricing page. For more information, see AWS KMS Pricing.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="architectural-overview">Architectural overview</h2>
<p>This post contains procedures for completing the following operations, which are also shown in Figure 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an RSA key pair in AWS KMS.</li>
<li>Download or pre-install the AWS KMS public key to an end-client device.</li>
<li>Generate an AES 256-bit key on an end client.</li>
<li>Encrypt a large payload of data on the end client by using the AES 256-bit key.</li>
<li>Encrypt the AES 256-bit key with the AWS KMS public key.</li>
<li>Transfer the encrypted payload and key.</li>
<li>Decrypt the AES 256-bit key by using AWS KMS.</li>
<li>Decrypt the payload data by using the now-shared AES 256-bit key.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>Figure 1: The steps for hybrid encryption</p>
<p>This diagram shows an end client device, an untrusted network such as a cellular network, and the AWS Cloud. An RSA key pair is generated in AWS KMS, and then the public key can either be embedded in the end client, or pulled by the end client through HTTP(S) or other remote means. In all circumstances, only the public key persists on the end client, which means that no secrets are stored on the device.</p>
<p>How you host the public key on your end clients depends on what network access they have. For example, an embedded Internet of Things (IoT) device for mining vehicles might never connect to the internet, but could communicate with a central system through a private 5G network. In this circumstance, you would host this public key within that network for retrieval. For other disconnected IoT devices that can connect to the internet, such as smart-home appliances, you might want to host the public key on a web server at a predefined URL or through an API.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever you vend public keys over an untrusted channel, such as when you vend the public key through an API, you should make sure that the key can be verified in some way to confirm that it hasn’t been tampered with. This is typically done by vending keys over an HTTPS connection, where the integrity of the keys is provided by the X.509 certificate that was used in the TLS connection. The X.509 certificate also verifies an association with the key-pair owner, typically by domain name.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="implement-the-solution">Implement the solution</h2>
<p>The following steps can be used as a proof-of-concept to guide you through implementing a hybrid-cryptosystem by using a KMS public key on an example device.</p>
<h3 id="create-keys-in-aws-kms">Create keys in AWS KMS</h3>
<p>In the first step of this solution, you create an RSA asymmetric key pair in AWS KMS (step 1 in the architectural overview). With AWS KMS, you can create key pairs in a variety of dimensions according to your security requirements or standards. For more information, see Choosing a KMS key type in the AWS KMS documentation.</p>
<p>To create a key pair in AWS KMS, use the CreateKey API. For this example, you will create an RSA key pair with RSA_2048 for the CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter and ENCRYPT_DECRYPT for the KeyUsage parameter in the AWS CLI. This post uses 2048-bit keys, but note that AWS KMS allows larger key sizes. The CLI will return a KeyId value that uniquely identifies the KMS key in your account, which you should take note of.</p>
<p><strong>To create a KMS key by using the CLI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command in the AWS CLI.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws kms create-key --key-spec RSA_2048 
    --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT 
    --description &#34;Example RSA Encryption Key Pair&#34;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow the Creating asymmetric KMS keys documentation to see how to use the AWS Management Console to create a KMS key pair with the same properties as shown here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When a KMS key is created, it will be logged by AWS CloudTrail, a service that monitors and records activity within your account. All API calls to the AWS KMS service are logged in CloudTrail, which you can use to audit access to KMS keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>To allow your KMS key to be identified by a human-readable string rather than KeyId, you can assign an alias for the KMS key (replace the target-key-id value of &lt;1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab&gt; with your KeyId). This makes it easier to use and manage.</p>
<p><strong>To create a KMS key alias for your key by using the CLI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command in the AWS CLI.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws kms create-alias 
    --alias-name alias/example-rsa-key 
    --target-key-id &lt;1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="download-the-public-key-from-aws-kms">Download the public key from AWS KMS</h3>
<p>A benefit of asymmetric encryption is that you can distribute a public key to a large, untrusted network, and the public key can only be used for encryption. Decryption of those messages can only be conducted by the corresponding private key. You can use the AWS KMS Encrypt API to encrypt data with a KMS key pair (specifically the public key). However, because the AWS APIs are authenticated by using a signature, you must have access to AWS credentials to use these APIs, which you might not want to do on untrusted devices. Additionally, in a private 5G network, you might not have the capability to call the AWS KMS API endpoints from the end clients. Instead, you can download the public key from a local source or embed that into the end client at the time of manufacture.</p>
<p>To retrieve a copy of the public key from your AWS KMS key pair, you can use the GetPublicKey API. The following example shows how to use this with the AWS CLI command get-public-key and reference the key alias you set earlier.</p>
<p><strong>To view the public key for your KMS key pair by using the CLI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command in the AWS CLI.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws kms get-public-key --key-id alias/example-rsa-key
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>The return value from this API will contain several elements, including the PublicKey. The returned PublicKey value is the DER-encoded X.509, and because you’re using the AWS CLI, Public Key is base64-encoded for readability purposes. By using the AWS CLI, you can query just the PublicKey return value, base64-decode it, and then save the key to a file on disk, as follows.</p>
<p><strong>To use the AWS CLI to query only the public key, then base64 decode it and output it to a file</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command in the AWS CLI.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws kms get-public-key 
--key-id alias/example-rsa-key  
--output text  
--query PublicKey | base64 -–decode &gt; public_key.der
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the local machine where you saved the public_key.der file will now represent the end-client device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you call this API by using one of the AWS SDKs, such as boto3, then the PublicKey value is not base64-encoded.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="create-an-aes-256-bit-symmetric-key-on-the-end-client">Create an AES 256-bit symmetric key on the end client</h3>
<p>Although the end client now has a copy of the public key from the associated KMS private key, the public key can’t be used for encrypting data that you plan on transmitting, due to the size limits on data that can be encrypted. Instead, you can use symmetric encryption. Typically, symmetric keys are smaller than asymmetric keys, the ciphers are faster when encrypting data, and the resulting ciphertext is similar in size to the original data.</p>
<p>To generate a symmetric key, you should use a source of random entropy. Some operating systems offer block access to hardware-based sources of random numbers, such as /dev/hwrng. To provide an example process in this blog post, you will use the OpenSSL rand utility, which uses a cryptographically secure pseudo random generator (CSPRNG) seeded by /dev/urandom. In production systems, you might have stronger sources of entropy to rely on, or compliance requirements for random number generation. In hardware-constrained environments, you should take extra care to make sure that sources of entropy are cryptographically secure. The following command uses OpenSSL to create an AES 256-bit (32 bytes) key and base64-encode it, then save it to disk in plaintext as key.b64.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Anyone with access to this file system will have access to this key.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>To use the OpenSSL rand command to create a symmetric key and output it to a file</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl rand -base64 32 &gt; key.b64
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encrypt-the-data-to-be-sent-from-the-end-client">Encrypt the data to be sent from the end client</h3>
<p>Now that you have two different key types on the end client, you can use a hybrid cryptosystem to encrypt a large text file. First, you will generate a sample file to encrypt on your system. By outputting some bytes from /dev/urandom, you can create this file to the size you want. The following command outputs 200 random bytes, base64-encodes the file, and writes that to disk in a file called encrypt.me.</p>
<p><strong>To generate a sample file from random data, which will be encrypted later</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>head -c 200 /dev/urandom | base64 –-wrap 0 &gt; encrypt.me
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will encrypt the newly created file with the AES 256-bit key that you created earlier (which is base64-encoded). By using the OpenSSL command line, you will encrypt the file on disk and create a new file called encrypt.me.enc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For For demonstration purposes, this solution uses OpenSSL to complete the encryption process. However, the command line OpenSSL enc utility doesn’t allow the cipher aes-256-gcm. Galois Counter Mode (GCM) is recommended when encrypting and sending data, because it prevents certain attacks in which ciphertexts are modified. Instead, for this demonstration, you will use aes-256-ctr.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>To use the OpenSSL enc command to encrypt your sample file with a symmetric key</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Enter the following command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl enc -aes-256-ctr 
-in encrypt.me -out encrypt.me.enc 
-pass file:./key.b64
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encrypt-the-aes-256-bit-key">Encrypt the AES 256-bit key</h3>
<p>So that the data can be decrypted again, you will need to share the same AES 256-bit key with the recipient. To share that with only the person who can use the KMS private key that you created earlier, you can encrypt the symmetric key (key.b64) with the RSA public key that you retrieved earlier (public_key.der).</p>
<p>Again, you will use OpenSSL to see how this works and the required cipher options. When encrypting or decrypting with a KMS RSA key pair, you can use one of two encryption algorithms, either RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1 or RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256. These identify the cipher suites used in encryption that are currently supported by AWS KMS for encryption.</p>
<p><strong>To use the OpenSSL pkeyutl command to encrypt your symmetric key with your local copy of your KMS public key</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl pkeyutl 
	-in key.b64 -out key.b64.enc 
	-inkey public_key.der -keyform DER -pubin -encrypt 
	-pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:oaep -pkeyopt rsa_oaep_md:sha256
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>This command creates a new file on disk called key.b64.enc. This file is the encrypted AES 256-bit key, which can now be transported securely across an insecure network, such as the internet. The last two options in the command define the padding mode used (OAEP) and the length of the message digest (SHA-256), which align with the options available to decrypt when you use the AWS KMS APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should securely delete both the original payload file (encrypt.me) and the plaintext AES 256-bit key (key.b64) if you want to prevent anyone else from accessing these files. At this point, you will have three files on disk: public_key.der, encrypt.me.enc, and key.b64.enc. If you want to verify the decryption process later in this example, keep these files.</p></blockquote>
<p>In production, you might never write any of these values to disk. Instead, you can keep all values in memory and only write the encrypted data (ciphertext) to disk, clearing memory after that process has completed.</p>
<p>You can now use the method of your choice to transfer the encrypted files across an unsecured network without compromising the privacy of those files. For smart-home appliance use cases, you can upload the encrypted files in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), a highly durable storage system that can be accessed from the internet, keeping in mind the preventative security practices that AWS recommends. Later, another service can pull these files from S3, and with the correct permissions for the KMS key, can decrypt the files by using the AWS KMS Decrypt API.</p>
<h3 id="decrypt-the-files">Decrypt the files</h3>
<p>With access to the decrypt operation for the KMS key and the encrypted files, you can now retrieve the plaintext data file again. To do this, you will replicate the preceding steps, but in reverse. This involves decrypting the AWS 256-bit key by using the AWS KMS API, and then using that result to decrypt the encrypted data. You will need access to the AWS KMS API to complete these actions, because the private key exists in plaintext only within the AWS KMS HSMs.</p>
<p><strong>To decrypt the files</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step is to decrypt the AWS 256-bit key. You will need to use the AWS CLI to submit the key.b64.enc file to the AWS KMS API, and specify the algorithm you used to encrypt the file (RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256). Use the following command to retrieve the AES 256-bit key in plaintext. Again, you’re using the –query selector to output only the plaintext, and then decode the base64 value.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws kms decrypt --key-id alias/example-rsa-key  
		--ciphertext-blob fileb://key.b64.enc 
		--encryption-algorithm RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 --output text 
		--query &#39;Plaintext&#39; | base64 --decode &gt; decrypted_key.b64
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>The final step in decrypting the data is to reverse the CTR encryption process you used in OpenSSL. If another mode of symmetric encryption was used, such as AES-GCM, then you would need to decrypt by using that algorithm and the input AES 256-bit key. Use the following OpenSSL command to retrieve the original plaintext payload.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl enc -d -aes-256-ctr 
		-in encrypt.me.enc -out decrypted.file 
		-pass file:./decrypted_key.b64
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, you learned how to combine AWS KMS asymmetric key pairs with locally created symmetric keys to encrypt and share data that exceeds 190 bytes, without storing a secret on a client device. By taking advantage of the RSA cryptosystem for offline encryption, you can reduce the exposure of plaintext data or secrets to devices outside of your control, and without having to complete complex key exchanges. By using the steps in this solution, you can more securely share large amounts of data, such as update files or configuration settings.
