				<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) successfully completed a surveillance audit with no findings for ISO 9001:2015, 27001:2022, 27017:2015, 27018:2019, 27701:2019, 20000-1:2018, and 22301:2019, and Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v4.0. EY CertifyPoint auditors conducted the audit and reissued the certificates on November 29, 2024. The objective of the audit was to assess the level of compliance with the requirements of the applicable international standards.</p>
<p>During this surveillance audit, we added two additional AWS services to the scope since the last certification issued on July 22, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Q Business</li>
<li>AWS Verified Access</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of AWS services that are certified under ISO and CSA STAR, see the AWS ISO and CSA STAR Certified page. Customers can also access the certifications in the AWS Management Console through AWS Artifact.</p>
