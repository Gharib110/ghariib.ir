<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 27, 2025</p>
<p>The financial services sector has long been a primary target for cybercriminals and the year 2025 will be no exception, according to BreachLock, a top cybersecurity company recognized by Gartner from 2021 to 2024 as a leading vendor in the Penetration Testing as a Service market.</p>
<p>There are five top cyber security challenges financial service institutions (FSIs) are likely to face in 2025:</p>
<p>1. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</p>
<p>2. Ransomware-as-a- Service (RaaS)</p>
<p>3. Third-Party and Supply Chain Risks</p>
<p>4. API Security Vulnerabilities</p>
<p>5. Regulatory Compliance</p>
<p>BreachLock explores the reasons behind these challenges and practical solutions to mitigate them.</p>
<p>As financial institutions adapt to new regulatory requirements and a fast-evolving digital landscape in 2025, cybersecurity will remain a critical priority. Challenges such as APTs, RaaS, and supply chain risks require proactive security strategies and tools to mitigate risks.</p>
<p>By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and modern unified platforms that integrate these technologies, FSIs can safeguard their assets, data, and reputation against persistent threats.</p>
