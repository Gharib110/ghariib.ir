				<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce the publication of our annual compliance assessment report on the Information Assurance Regulation (IAR) established by the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The report covers the AWS Middle East (UAE) Region.</p>
<p>The IAR provides management and technical information security controls to help establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance. AWS alignment with IAR requirements demonstrates our ongoing commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for cloud service providers. As such, IAR-regulated customers can continue to use AWS services with confidence.</p>
<p>Independent third-party auditors from BDO evaluated AWS for the period of November 1, 2023, to October 31, 2024. The assessment report that illustrates the status of AWS compliance is available through AWS Artifact. AWS Artifact is a self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. Sign in to AWS Artifact in the AWS Management Console, or learn more at Getting Started with AWS Artifact.</p>
<p>AWS strives to continuously bring services into the scope of its compliance programs to help you meet your architectural and regulatory needs. If you have questions or feedback about IAR compliance, reach out to your AWS account team.</p>
<p>To learn more about our compliance and security programs, see AWS Compliance Programs. As always, we value your feedback and questions; reach out to the AWS Compliance team through the Contact Us page.</p>
