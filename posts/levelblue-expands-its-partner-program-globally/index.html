			<h1>LevelBlue Expands Its Partner Program Globally</h1>

			<div>
				<p>Businesses worldwide are challenged with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, and the need for advanced security solutions has never been greater. That’s why we’re expanding the LevelBlue Partner Program through strategic alliances to add to our strong global base of managed service providers (MSPs) managed security service providers (MSSPs) and resellers in different regions including Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>We’re excited about a new partnership with Renaissance, Ireland’s leading value-added distributor. Through this alliance, Renaissance is bringing LevelBlue’s managed security services to the Irish market, addressing the growing demand for security solutions amid rapid growth in the region.</p>
<p>Ireland’s MSPs and MSSPs are facing challenges in delivering complex cybersecurity services due to resource limitations. Through our collaboration, Renaissance provides Irish MSPs and MSSPs with the ability to complement their security capabilities without requiring substantial investments in building in-house capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing our footprint in Europe, we’re also expanding our reach within the Middle East. In October of 2024, we strengthened our collaboration with Mindfire Technologies, the largest MSSP in the Middle East. Through our joint efforts, we are bringing cybersecurity services tailored to the needs of organizations within the region, helping them to stay ahead of evolving threats and scale their security operations.</p>
<p>However, our expansion isn’t just about growing our own reach—it’s about fostering a stronger, more resilient cybersecurity ecosystem worldwide. By working closely with regional partners like Renaissance and Mindfire, we ensure that businesses of all sizes can access world-class cybersecurity services tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-our-partners"><strong>What This Means for Our Partners</strong></h2>
<p>By working with LevelBlue, our partners benefit from offering not just world-class security solutions, but we are a trusted partner, providing key resources for their success including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full demo and training environment</li>
<li>Online training and certification</li>
<li>Self-service technical training</li>
<li>Sales enablement</li>
<li>Technical support</li>
<li>Marketing support</li>
<li>Centralized management console</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-businesses"><strong>What This Means for Businesses</strong></h2>
<p>With our strategic alliances, LevelBlue is simplifying cybersecurity for businesses globally, enabling them to innovate with confidence.</p>
<p>For organizations in Europe, the Middle East, and beyond, our expansion brings numerous benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to Award-Winning Security Services: Organizations can leverage LevelBlue’s managed security services to protect their digital assets and maintain compliance.</li>
<li>Stronger Security Posture: With LevelBlue’s expertise, companies can enhance their cybersecurity defenses without needing to build in-house teams from scratch.</li>

<li>Confidence to Innovate: With a strong security foundation, businesses can pursue digital transformation and growth without fear of cyber threats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-ahead"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As part of our commitment to the LevelBlue Partner Program, we are evolving our offerings to help MSPs and MSSPs open new growth opportunities, In October 2024 we announced four security services to our partners that easily extend and integrate with LevelBlue USM Anywhere, which includes proactive threat intelligence: LevelBlue Managed Threat Detection and Response; LevelBlue Incident Response Retainer; LevelBlue Managed Vulnerability Program; LevelBlue Managed Endpoint Security. The new services give LevelBlue partners and their customers the solutions and expertise needed to navigate today’s complex threat landscape.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the launch of the enhanced LevelBlue Partner Program in March. There will be even more opportunities for MSPs and MSSPs to help customers safeguard their digital infrastructure.</p>
