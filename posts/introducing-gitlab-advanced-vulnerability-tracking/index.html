				<p>DevSecOps streamlines software development by allowing teams to ship features quickly and providing short feedback cycles for customers. These short feedback cycles can be used to monitor the impact of a feature from the time it is shipped and to inform developers and product managers about the success or failure of a given deployment.</p>
<p>GitLab, as an agnostic DevSecOps platform, can act as an integration point for different CI/CD tools that often contribute to user-facing functionality. For example, the vulnerability report, which displays all detected vulnerabilities, is visible as a single functionality, but the data in the report may come from a number of different tools in various pipelines.</p>
<p>In a heterogeneous Static Application Security Testing (SAST) setup we find two potential sources of vulnerability deduplication:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code volatility refers to the reintroduction of vulnerabilities in a constantly changing code base.</li>
<li>Double reporting refers to duplication introduced by multiple tools that are reporting the same vulnerability.</li>
</ol>
<p>GitLab addresses these two sources of duplication by means of the Advanced Vulnerability Tracking feature, which identifies and deduplicates vulnerabilities in a constantly changing code base.</p>
<p>Advanced Vulnerability Tracking leverages contextual information provided by generated syntax-trees to scope vulnerabilities and generates location fingerprints for vulnerabilities that are less fragile across code changes in comparison to other tracking methods.</p>
<p>In a recent study, we demonstrated that our vulnerability tracking approach was 30% more effective than traditional, line-based vulnerability tracking where <code>&lt;file, line number&gt;</code> are used to fingerprint vulnerabilities. This means that advanced vulnerability tracking reduces the manual effort of auditing vulnerabilities by 30%. In addition, our study suggested that the positive effect of our vulnerability tracking method increases over time.</p>
<p>The preprint of our study &ldquo;A scalable, effective and simple Vulnerability Tracking approach for heterogeneous SAST setups based on Scope+Offset&rdquo; will be presented at the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (Software Engineering in Practice Track) 2025.</p>
