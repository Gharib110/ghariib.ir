<p>We have always worked to support the information security community as a whole, and over the years experimented with different ideas <em>(some with a greater success than others)</em>. One of the key components to Kali is the tools included <em>(either pre-installed or installed via apt)</em>. Joining together infosec professional/hobbyist and tool authors, today we are announcing another partnership: <strong><a href="https://www.bc-security.org/post/kali-and-bc-security-partnership">Kali has partnered with BC Security</a></strong>.</p>
<p>BC Security is the team who is currently maintaining the most active fork of <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/powershell-empire">Empire</a>. In August 2019, the <a href="https://twitter.com/xorrior/status/1156626181107736576">original maintainers</a> archived the project, but with Open-source projects <em>(as long as they don’t break software licenses</em>) other groups can take someone else’s code and improve upon it. This is exactly what BC Security did, forking the project, to keep the flame of <a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire">PowerShell Empire</a> alive.</p>
<p>Empire is a post-exploitation framework, which its agents supporting various different Operating Systems (OS). Windows is purely implemented in PowerShell <em>(without <code>powershell.exe</code>!)</em>, and Linux/macOS is done in Python 3. Feature rich with various options to bypass various protections <em>(and allows for easy modification for custom evasion)</em>, Empire is often a favourite for Command and Control (C2) activity.</p>
<p>We first had interaction with BC Security, when they were porting over the original Empire code base (v2.5) from Python 2 to 3 <em>(as v2 had reached <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/">End of Life</a> in January 2020)</em>. This is to help ensure Empire is is up-to-date and relevant with the modern software stack. They have also put in the time to increase empires features <em>(growing on the original authors, that malware can be in PowerShell format)</em>. BC Security also have created their own “Graphical User Interface (GUI)”, <a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Starkiller">Starkiller</a>, to go along side Empire.</p>
<p>Under their sponsorware model, in order to get the latest version of Empire &amp; Starkiller, you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BC-SECURITY">sponsor</a> to get the latest access, <a href="https://www.kali.org/">use Kali Linux</a>, or wait 30 days until the <a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY">source code becomes public</a>. We believe the partnership will aid development of the tool <em>(who doesn’t want new features!)</em>, but at the same time allowing access to it for as many people as possible.</p>
<p>With the announcement of the partnership, there are new versions being released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empire has reached v3.7</li>
<li>Starkiller is now at v1.6</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the changelog and their views, you can read about on <a href="https://www.bc-security.org/post/kali-and-bc-security-partnership">their blog</a>. Afterwards give Empire a try <em>if you’re <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">using Kali Linux</a>!</em></p>
