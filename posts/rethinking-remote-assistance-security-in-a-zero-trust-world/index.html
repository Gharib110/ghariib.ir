			<h1>Rethinking remote assistance security in a Zero Trust world</h1>

			<div>
				<p>The recent breach of the United States Treasury underscores a stark reality: cyber adversaries are no longer just looking for gaps in traditional network security—they are actively exploiting the tools organizations rely on for daily operations. Remote assistance technologies, essential for IT support and business continuity, have become prime targets for credential theft, moving within the network, and system exploitation. The message is clear: securing remote assistance is no longer optional; it is a fundamental requirement for maintaining operational resilience.  </p>
<h2 id="a-multi-pronged-approach-to-securing-remote-assistancewith-zero-trust">A multi-pronged approach to securing remote assistance with Zero Trust</h2>
<p>For too long, remote assistance security has been presumed rather than intentionally designed into its architecture. The rise in sophisticated cyberthreats demands a fundamental shift in our approach. Organizations must rethink remote assistance security through the lens of Zero Trust, using the three key principles of <strong>verify explicitly, use least privilege</strong>, and <strong>assume breach</strong> as a guide and ensuring that every session, user, and device is verified, compliant, and monitored before access is granted. </p>
<p>Discover how implementing Zero Trust can fortify your remote assistance security by visiting our Zero Trust Workshop, where you’ll find an interactive guide to embedding security into your IT operations.  </p>
<p>This requires a structured approach with a foundation of: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identity and access control</strong>—ensuring that only authenticated, compliant users and devices can initiate or receive remote assistance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endpoint security and compliance</strong>—enforcing security baselines and conditional access across all managed devices. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embedded security in remote assistance</strong>—building security into the very foundation of remote assistance tools, eliminating gaps that cyberattackers can exploit. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="identity-and-access-control-the-first-line-of-cybersecurity-defense">Identity and access control: The first line of cybersecurity defense</h2>
<p>Identity security is the cornerstone of any secure remote assistance strategy. A compromised identity is often the first step in a cyberattack, making it critical to ensure only verified users and devices can initiate or receive remote assistance sessions. Organizations must enforce: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit identity verification</strong>—using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based conditional access to ensure only authorized users gain access. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Least privilege access</strong>—ensuring remote assistance is granted only for the necessary duration and with minimal privileges to reduce the risk of exploitation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time risk assessment</strong>—continuously evaluating access requests for anomalies or suspicious activity to prevent unauthorized access. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By shifting the security perimeter to identity, organizations create an environment where trust is earned dynamically, not assumed.  </p>
<h2 id="closing-the-gaps-with-endpoint-security-and-compliancewith-microsoft-intune">Closing the gaps with endpoint security and compliance with Microsoft Intune</h2>
<p>Cyberattackers frequently exploit outdated, misconfigured, or non-compliant endpoints to gain a foothold in enterprise environments. IT and security leaders must ensure that remote assistance is built on a strong endpoint security foundation, where every device connecting to corporate resources meets strict compliance standards. This highlights the need for organizations to establish consistent security policies across all devices, ensuring they are up to date and compliant before being granted remote access.  </p>
<p>Microsoft Intune provides the necessary tools to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforce compliance policies</strong>—restrict remote assistance to managed, up-to-date, and policy-compliant devices. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply security baselines</strong>—standardize configurations across endpoints to minimize security gaps. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrate with Microsoft’s security ecosystem</strong>—connecting remote assistance workflows with Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Defender product family, and other security tools for real-time monitoring and cyberthreat mitigation.  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remote-help-secure-remote-assistance-built-for-zero-trust">Remote Help: Secure remote assistance built for Zero Trust </h2>
<p>As organizations work toward a Zero Trust model, secure remote assistance must align with core security principles. This means moving beyond reactive security measures and embedding proactive, policy-driven controls into every remote session. Microsoft Intune Remote Help was designed with these imperatives in mind, providing a robust solution that enhances IT support while minimizing security risks. </p>
<p>While legacy remote assistance tools can lack enterprise-grade security controls, Remote Help is built to align with Zero Trust principles. Unlike traditional solutions, Remote Help: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrates directly with Microsoft Entra ID</strong>—enhancing security where authentication and access controls can consistently take place. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provides session transparency</strong>—IT teams can track and monitor remote assistance activity in real time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforces compliance requirements</strong>—only compliant, managed devices can participate in remote assistance sessions.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For highly regulated industries, Remote Help offers an alternative to third-party tools that may introduce security blind spots. By embedding security directly into remote assistance workflows, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.  </p>

<h2 id="engaging-customers-and-partners-to-strengthen-cyber-resilience">Engaging customers and partners to strengthen cyber resilience </h2>
<p>Cybersecurity is a team sport. As cyberthreat actors grow more sophisticated, collaboration across industries is essential. Microsoft is committed to engaging with customers and partners to drive security innovation and resilience. Initiatives such as the Windows Resiliency Initiative (WRI) focus on: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reducing the need for admin privileges</strong>—helping organizations adopt a least privilege approach at scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing identity protection</strong>—strengthening defenses against phishing and identity-based attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick machine recovery</strong>—empowering IT teams with tools to rapidly store compromised devices remotely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By fostering collaboration and continuously evolving security measures, Microsoft is helping organizations stay ahead of emerging cyberthreats. These on-going conversations with our customers and partners are crucial in shaping resilient security strategies that adapt to an ever-changing cyberthreat landscape.   </p>
<h2 id="a-security-first-approach-for-the-future">A security-first approach for the future </h2>
<p>The increasing reliance on remote assistance demands a security-first mindset. Organizations must recognize that every remote access session presents an opportunity for exploitation from an ever-evolving cast of cyberattackers. Rather than treating security as an afterthought, it must be deeply integrated into the architecture of the remote assistance solutions. A modern approach requires proactive risk mitigation, continuous verification, and seamless security controls that support productivity without compromising protection.  </p>
<p>Now is the time for IT and security leaders to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluate your current remote assistance tools</strong>—identifying the gaps and areas for improvement. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt Zero Trust principles</strong>—ensuring the access is verified and explicitly and continuously monitored. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage solutions like Microsoft Intune and Remote Help</strong>—deploying secure, enterprise-grade remote assistance capabilities. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking these steps, you can strengthen your security posture, minimize risk, and ensure that remote assistance remains a tool for operational efficiency rather than a gateway for cyberthreats.  </p>
