<p>Kodi, the popular free open-source home theater software, released new 21.2 version today with many improvements and tons of bug-fixes.</p>
<p>First, the new Kodi 21.2 features <strong>significant speed increase of library scans</strong> (back to v20 level) as well as faster artwork caching.</p>

</p>
<p>For Linux users, the new release enabled/fixed HDR to SDR tone mapping on video sources with partial or missing display metadata, fixed HDR passthrough for HDR videos that didn’t switch TV into HDR mode, and fixed issue that windowed Kodi doubled in size on every start when using Wayland with a scaling factor &gt; 100%.</p>
<p>On Android, it added default button maps, and generic controller buttons/axes, restored the ability to browse SMB shares on Android / others posix systems. And, it now displays Kodi screen instantly when resuming from home screen.</p>
<p>There are as well some fixes for Android, including resuming paused media playback not working via play/pause media key press, Media Session does not update on Play/Pause -&gt; Stop, crashes on GoogleTV when Tailscale network is connected, and connectivity to FTP sources which require additional flags such as TLS.</p>

</p>
<p>Kodi now has a donate page with QR code</p>
<p>Kodi now does not scan for external subs for UPnP renderer, thus playback as a UPnP renderer starts faster, and for some UPnP controllers/servers it will be possible to play more than one video.</p>
<p>It replaced context menu items ‘<code>Set actor/artist thumb</code>‘ with ‘<code>Choose art</code>‘ in video navigation window, making it possible again to add and set other artwork, not only thumbnails.</p>
<p>And, it now preserves special characters in default names of extras, shows a donations tab with QR code in System Info, and supports HDR toggle in Windows 11 24H2.</p>
<p>They are as well tons of other changes in the release, including:</p>
<ul>
