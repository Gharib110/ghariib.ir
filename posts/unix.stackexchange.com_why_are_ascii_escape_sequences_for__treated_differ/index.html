<p><strong>Published on</strong>: 2024-12-07T13:13:12Z</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Using the GNU version of all 3 tools (scroll down for FreeBSD attempts), if I wanted to find  in input using awk with a -delimited script we can try matching using the hex and octal escape sequences: $ echo &quot;&quot; | awk /\x27/   $ echo &quot;&quot; | awk /\047/   $ echo &quot;&quot; | awk /\o047/ awk: cmd. line:1: warning: regexp escape sequence `\o is not a known regexp operator  so the first 2 work and the 3rd doesnt, as youd intuitively expect. Now lets try the same with sed (with or without -E): $ echo &quot;&quot; | sed -n /\x27/p   $ echo &quot;&quot; | sed -n /\047/p $  $ echo &quot;&quot; | sed -n /\o047/p   and grep (also with or without -E): $ echo &quot;&quot; | grep \x27 grep: warning: stray \ before x  $ echo &quot;&quot; | grep \047 grep: warning: stray \ before 0  $ echo &quot;&quot; | grep \o047 grep: warning: stray \ before o  So:  Most importantly: why are they different? Secondary curiosity: Is there a way to use an escape sequence in grep to match  without resorting to GNU greps non-portable -P option and without expanding the escape sequence before grep sees it using shell constructs such as grep $\047?  Its worth noting that octal \047 is the recommended escape sequence in awk (see <a href="http://awk.freeshell.org/PrintASingleQuote">http://awk.freeshell.org/PrintASingleQuote</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230530010453/http://awk.freeshell.org/PrintASingleQuote">https://web.archive.org/web/20230530010453/http://awk.freeshell.org/PrintASingleQuote</a> if thats down). For the purposes of this question Im not interested in alternatives that allow literal  or what any other tools do or anything else, Im just trying to find out why those 3 specific regexp-matching tools treat ASCII escape sequences differently from each other. I would, however, be interested in learning how BSD or other variants of those 3 tools behave given the same scripts shown above. Additional Information: FreeBSD This is FreeBSD 13.1 behavior: % echo &quot;&quot; | awk /\x27/  % echo &quot;&quot; | awk /\047/  % echo &quot;&quot; | sed -n /\x27/p  % echo &quot;&quot; | sed -n /\047/p % echo &quot;&quot; | sed -n /\o047/p sed: 1: &quot;/\o047/p&quot;: RE error: trailing backslash () % echo &quot;&quot; | grep \x27 grep: trailing backslash () % echo &quot;&quot; | grep \047 %   POSIX Heres what the POSIX standards for Regular Expressions and the 3 tools in question say about this:  regexps: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html</a> awk: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/awk.html">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/awk.html</a> sed: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/sed.html">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/sed.html</a> grep: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/grep.html">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/grep.html</a>  From the regexp spec we see that neither x nor 0 are &quot;Special Characters&quot; in a BRE or ERE so therefore they are &quot;Ordinary Characters&quot; and that  When not inside a bracket expression, the interpretation of an ordinary character preceded by an unescaped &lt;backslash&gt; is undefined, except for:  followed by lists of characters, none of which includes 0 or x for BREs or EREs so my conclusion from that is that neither \x27 nor \047 are defined behavior in a regexp per POSIX. The POSIX awk spec Regular Expressions section says:  \ddd A &lt;backslash&gt; character followed by the longest sequence of one, two, or three octal-digit characters (01234567). If all of the digits are 0 (that is, representation of the NUL character), the behavior is undefined. If the digits produce a value greater than octal 377, the behavior is undefined.  so we know that \0 is defined for a POSIX awk but \x is not, so the awk behavior for \x is undefined by POSIX for awk and therefore is left up to the various awk implementations. The POSIX sed spec Regular Expressions section adds a couple of twists to regexp but doesnt mention \0 or \x and defers to the POSIX regexp definitions and so \0 or \x are undefined by POSIX for sed. The POSIX grep spec Description section defers entirely to the POSIX regexp definitions and so \0 or \x are undefined by POSIX for grep. So apparently the meaning of \xdd is left up to the tool implementers for grep, sed, and awk, while the meaning of \0dd is defined for awk but left up to the implementers for grep and sed. GNU Manuals The GNU awk manual Escape Sequences section says:  \nnn The octal value nnn, where nnn stands for 1 to 3 digits between 0 and 7. For example, the code for the ASCII ESC (escape) character is \033. \xhh The hexadecimal value hh, where hh stands for a sequence of hexadecimal digits (09, and either AF or af). A maximum of two digits are allowed after the \x&hellip;  so thats where \x47 is defined for GNU awk. The GNU sed manual Escape Sequences section says:  \oxxx Produces or matches a character whose octal ASCII value is xxx. \xxx Produces or matches a character whose hexadecimal ASCII value is xx.  so thats where \o047 and \x27 are defined for GNU sed. The GNU grep manual has no references I could find to either hex or octal escape sequences which explains the warning messages we see when we try to use them and presumably means they simply arent supported in GNU grep.</p>
