<p>Nearly four years ago now, I set out to write a book with Charlotte and RobIt was the stories behind the stories, the things that drove me to write my most important blog posts, and then the things that happened afterwards. It&rsquo;s almost like a collection of meta posts, each one adding behind-the-scenes commentary that most people reading my material didn&rsquo;t know about at the time.</p>
<p>It was a strange time for all of us back then. I didn&rsquo;t leave the country for the first time in over a decade. I barely even left the state. I had time to toil on the passion project that became this book. As I wrote about years later, there were also other things occupying my mind at the time. Writing this book was cathartic, providing me the opportunity to express some of the emotions I was feeling at the time and to reflect on life.</p>
<p>Speaking of reflecting, this week was Have I Been Pwned&rsquo;s 11th birthday. Reaching this milestone, getting back to travel (I&rsquo;m writing this poolside with a beer at a beautiful hotel in Dubai), life settling down (while sitting next to my amazing wife), and it now being 2 years since we launched the book, I decided we should just give it away for free. I mean <em>really</em> free, not &ldquo;give me all your personal details, then here&rsquo;s a download link&rdquo; I mean, here are the <em>direct</em> download links:</p>
<ol>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>EPUB</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you enjoy the book. It&rsquo;s the culmination of so many things I worked so hard to create over the preceding decade and a half, and I&rsquo;m really happy to just be giving it away now. Enjoy the book ðŸ˜Š</p>
