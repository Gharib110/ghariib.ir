<p>It sounds easy - &ldquo;just verify people&rsquo;s age before they access the service&rdquo; - but whether we&rsquo;re talking about porn in the US or Australia&rsquo;s incoming social media laws, the reality is <em>way</em> more complex than that. There&rsquo;s no unified approach across jurisdictions and even within a single country like Australia, the closest we&rsquo;ve got to that is a government scheme usually intended for accessing public services. And even if there <em>was</em> a technically workable model, who wants to get either the gov or some big tech firm involved in their use of Instagram or Pornhub?! There&rsquo;s a <em>social</em> acceptance to be considered and not only that, circumvention of age controls is <em>very</em> easy when you can simply VPN into another jurisdiction and access the same website blocked in your locale. Or in the case of the adult material, I&rsquo;m told (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) there are many other legally operating websites in other parts of the world that are less inclined to block individuals in specific states from foreign countries. There&rsquo;ll be no easy solutions for this one, but it&rsquo;ll make for an entertaining year üòä</p>
