<hr>
<p>Customers often ask how to limit access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to only a specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. A popular approach has been to use the <code>Principal</code> element to list the users or roles who need access to the bucket. However, the <code>Principal</code> element needs the exact values of the <code>user</code> ARN, <code>role</code> ARN, or <code>assumed-role</code> ARN. It does not support using a wildcard (*) to include all role sessions, nor does it allow you to use policy variables.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we show how to restrict S3 bucket access to a specific IAM role or user within an account by using the <code>Conditions</code> element. Even if another user in the same account has an <code>Admin</code> policy or a policy with <code>s3:*</code>, they will be denied access if they are not explicitly listed in the <code>Conditions</code> element. You can use this approach, for example, to limit access to a bucket with sensitive content or additional security requirements.</p>
<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The solution in this post uses a bucket policy to restrict access to an S3 bucket, even if an entity has access to the full API of S3 through an attached identity-based policy. The following diagram illustrates how this works for accessing an S3 bucket within the same account as your IAM user or IAM role. We recommend that you use IAM roles, and only use IAM users for use cases that aren’t supported by federated users.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Figure 1: Diagram illustrating how to access an S3 bucket within the same account as your IAM user or IAM role</p>
<p>The workflow in Figure 1 is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IAM user’s policy and the IAM role’s identity-based policy grant access to <code>“s3:*”</code>.</li>
<li>The S3 bucket policy associated with Bucket B restricts access to only the IAM role. This means that only the IAM role is able to access its content.</li>
<li>Both the IAM user and the IAM role can access other S3 buckets (for example, Bucket A) in the account. The IAM role is able to access both buckets, but the user can access only the S3 buckets without the bucket policy attached to them. Even though both the role and the user have full <code>“s3:*”</code> permissions, the bucket policy negates access to the bucket for anyone that has not assumed the role.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference in the cross-account approach is that every bucket must have a bucket policy attached to allow access to the IAM role from the other account. The following diagram illustrates how this works in a cross-account deployment scenario.</p>
<p>
<figure>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Figure 2: Diagram illustrating how to access an S3 bucket in a different account than your IAM role</p>
<p>The workflow in Figure 2 is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IAM role’s identity-based policy and the IAM users’ policy in the bucket account both grant access to <code>“s3:*”</code></li>
<li>Bucket policy B denies access to all IAM users and roles <strong>except</strong> the role specified, and the policy defines what the role is allowed to do with the bucket.</li>
<li>Bucket policy A allows access to the IAM role from the other account.</li>
<li>The IAM user and IAM role can both access Bucket A because the IAM user is in the same account and there is an explicit <code>Allow</code> in bucket policy A for the role. The role can access both buckets because the <code>Deny</code> in bucket policy B is only for principals other than the IAM role.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-the-awsprincipalarn-condition">Using the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> condition</h2>
<p>You can use different types of condition keys to compare details about the principal making the request with the principal properties that you specify in the policy. We recommend that you use the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> key. The <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> key compares the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the principal that made the request with the ARN that you specify in the policy.</p>
<p>You could also use the <code>aws:userid</code> policy variable to uniquely identify a user or role in their explicit <code>Deny</code> statements. There is added complexity with using <code>aws:userid</code> to find the value because you have to perform an API call using valid credentials. When working with IAM roles this activity has additional complexity because you are required to get the AssumedRoleUser information, which will not only include the unique role ID, but also the <code>role-session-name</code> that was provided while assuming the role. For example, the <code>aws:userid</code> for an <code>AssumedRoleUser</code> will be as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws:userid – AROADBQP57FF2AEXAMPLE:role-session-name
</code></pre><p>It becomes inconvenient to manage and track these IDs when you have a large list of users and roles to be included in the policy.</p>
<p>To mitigate these challenges, we recommend that you use the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> condition key. For IAM roles, the request context returns the ARN of the role, not the ARN of the user that assumed the role. AWS recommends that you specify the ARN for resources in policies instead of unique IDs and that you perform IAM policy audits on a periodic basis. Let’s look at how to use the condition key in an IAM policy.</p>
<h2 id="granting-same-account-bucket-access-to-a-specific-role">Granting same-account bucket access to a specific role</h2>
<p>When accessing a bucket from within the same account, in most cases it is not necessary to use a bucket policy because the policy defines access that is already granted by the user’s direct IAM policy. S3 bucket policies are usually used for cross-account access, but you can also use them to restrict access through an explicit <code>Deny</code>. The <code>Deny</code> would be applied to all principals whether they were in the same account as the bucket or within a different account.</p>
<p>In this case, you use the IAM user or role ARN with the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> condition key in a <code>StringNotEquals</code> or <code>StringNotLike</code> condition with a wildcard string. In addition, you use the <code>aws:PrincipalARN</code> key to compare the ARN of the principal that made the request with the ARN that you specify in the policy. Using a conditional logic element allows for the use of a wildcard string to allow for any role session name to be accepted.</p>
<p>Once you have the ARN of the role to which you want to allow access, you need to block the access of other users from within the same account as the bucket. An example policy to block access to the bucket and its objects for users that are not using the IAM role credentials would look like the following.</p>

</code></pre><p>By following the guidance in this post, you restrict S3 bucket access to a specific IAM role or user in same-account and cross-account scenarios, even if the user has an <code>Admin</code> policy or a policy with <code>“s3:*”</code>. There are many applications of this logic in which requirements will vary across use cases. We recommend to employ the principle of least privilege wherever possible, and to grant only the minimum permissions that are required to perform necessary tasks.</p>
