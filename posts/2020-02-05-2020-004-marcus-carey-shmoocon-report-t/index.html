<p>“GreyMatter integrates security data from security incident and event manager (SIEM), endpoint detection and response (EDR), firewalls, threat intelligence feeds, and other security tools, and includes analysis functions and automation. Threatcare&rsquo;s technology — which will become a new feature on the platform — simulates how a specific threat or attack could target an organization&rsquo;s network in order to determine whether its security tools and settings are or are not actually working to thwart the threats.”</p>
<p>Security model - everyone’s is diff</p>
<p>    How do you work with your threat model?</p>
<p>    A proper threat model</p>
<p><strong>Attack Simulation -</strong> </p>
<p>    How is this different from doing a typical Incident Response tabletop? Threat modeling systems?</p>
<p>    How is this different than a pentest?</p>
<p>    Is this automated red teaming? How effective can automated testing be?</p>
<p>    Is this like some kind of constant scanning system?</p>
<p>    How does this work with threat intel feeds? </p>
<p>    Can it simulate ransomware, or any attacks?</p>
<p>Hedgehog principles</p>
<p>    A lot of things crappily, and nothing good</p>
