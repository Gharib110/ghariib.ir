<p>Every day, I talk with security leaders who are navigating a critical balancing act. On one side, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting transformative technologies like generative AI and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other, they’re working to maintain strong security controls and visibility across an increasingly complex landscape. We all know that adding more tools and controls isn’t sustainable. We need a different approach to security at scale.</p>
<h2 id="reinforce-2025-your-roadmap-to-security-that-powers-innovation">re:Inforce 2025: Your roadmap to security that powers innovation</h2>
<p>This is what shaped our vision for AWS re:Inforce 2025. When done right, security at scale becomes a business accelerator, helping organizations move faster and more confidently in the cloud. This is more than just a philosophy; it’s a practical reality I’ve seen proven time and again by our customers, and it’s what we want to help every organization achieve.</p>
<p>At re:Inforce, we’ll share a vision for simplifying security at scale that’s deeply rooted in our experiences supporting millions of customers worldwide. We’ll explore how organizations are building inherently resilient applications that can withstand modern threats while accelerating innovation. I’m particularly excited to showcase real customer examples and architectural patterns that demonstrate how security better enables your business goals.</p>
<h2 id="an-environment-built-for-learning-cloud-security">An environment built for learning cloud security</h2>
<p>There’s a reason we created re:Inforce as a dedicated in-person security event. While I love our broader AWS events, security practitioners need space to dive deep into implementation details, ask tough questions, and work through complex scenarios. At re:Inforce, you can grab a whiteboard with the engineers who built our security services, collaborate with security partners, and schedule personal time with our leaders to tackle your specific security needs. It’s the kind of environment where real learning happens.</p>
<p>We’ve designed multiple learning paths to meet you wherever you are in your security journey. With over 250 technical sessions, you’ll find content that matches your needs – whether you’re looking to automate security controls, align development and security teams, or transform your security operations. You’ll find interactive workshops where you’ll build solutions in real-time, small-group technical deep-dives, hands-on labs where you can test new approaches, and solution-building sessions with AWS experts. Best of all, 70% of our content is at advanced or expert level, making sure you get the detailed implementation guidance you need.</p>
<p>I invite you to join us for three days that will transform how you think about and implement security in the cloud. Registration is now open, and I encourage you to secure your spot early—based on previous years, spots will fill up quickly. Join us to explore how simplified, scalable cloud security can fuel your organization’s future. <strong>Register today with the code SECBLObhZzr9 to receive a limited time $300 USD discount, while supplies last.</strong></p>
