<p>From this code, we can infer that <code>rcx</code> points to a <code>struct</code> that has a <code>QWORD</code>-sized field at offset <code>+0x70</code>. However, from this code alone, we don&rsquo;t know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The true type of the field at offset <code>+0x70</code>;</li>
<li>The types and locations of any other fields;</li>
<li>How big the <code>struct</code> is;</li>
<li>Where else in the program the <code>struct</code> is used;</li>
<li>Whether the <code>struct</code> contains any other <code>struct</code>s, or is contained in any other <code>struct</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most precise <code>struct</code> we can infer based upon this evidence is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>struct sub_180013E60_arg_0 {
  char gap0[0x70];
  _QWORD qw70;
};
</code></pre><p>To obtain more information about the <code>struct</code>, we would need to go on a scavenger hunt looking at the callers of <code>sub_180013E60</code> and following the pointer around the code to find other accesses. This procedure can easily lead to dead-ends, where the pointer is read from or written to another memory location, and we have no easy way of knowing what other parts of the code access that memory location; or if the function or its callers were declared <code>virtual</code> and hence called indirectly. In short, structure recovery is a tedious process that involves working with incomplete information most of the time, and gradually refining that information by finding other uses of the same structure type.</p>
<p>This blog entry describes an overlooked source of information in C++ programs that can make manual and automated type reconstruction more efficient. More information about the data types used within a function is hiding in plain sight; we can exploit it if we simply know where to look and how to interpret it.</p>
<p>Hex-Rays 9.0 contains built-in support to display this information &ndash; namely, C++ exception <code>wind</code> and <code>unwind</code> metadata on MSVC/x64 targets &ndash; naturally and automatically, directly in the decompilation listing.</p>
<h1 id="background-c-exception-support">Background: C++ Exception Support</h1>
<p>Like other programming languages, C++ supports the notion of exceptions. The three relevant language keywords are <code>throw</code>, <code>try</code>, and <code>catch</code>. (Standard C++ does not have a <code>finally</code> keyword.)</p>
<p>Upon encountering an exceptional situation, C++ code can use the <code>throw</code> keyword to raise a new exception. For example, consider the following function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void may_throw() {
  if ( rand() &amp; 1 )
    throw std::runtime_error(&#34;You lose&#34;);
}
</code></pre><p>C++ code uses the <code>try</code> keyword to create a scope in which an exception may occur. <code>try</code> scopes have one or more <code>catch</code> blocks to catch specific types of exceptions. For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>try {
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;No exception\n&#34;);
}
catch ( std::runtime_error &amp;r ) {
  printf(&#34;Caught standard runtime_error %s\n&#34;, r.what());
}
catch ( std::exception &amp;e ) {
  printf(&#34;Caught standard exception %s\n&#34;, e.what());
}
catch ( ... ) {
  printf(&#34;Caught any exception\n&#34;);
}
</code></pre><p>A <code>catch</code> handler might decide that, despite catching an exception, it is unable to handle it, and that the exception should be passed to the next <code>catch</code> handler (or to the next <code>try</code> block if no remaining <code>catch</code> handler can process it). Using the keyword <code>throw</code> by itself will propagate the exception as such. For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>try {
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;No exception\n&#34;);
}
catch ( std::runtime_error &amp;r ) {
  printf(&#34;Can&#39;t handle standard runtime_error %s\n&#34;, r.what());
  throw; // &lt;- HERE: let the next handler try to process it
}
</code></pre><h2 id="hex-rays-90-support">Hex-Rays 9.0 Support</h2>
<p>I have spent all of 2024 implementing C++ exception metadata for MSVC/x64 into Hex-Rays 9.0. It is capable of representing <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> blocks, including nested ones, as such:</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Or <code>try</code> blocks with multiple <code>catch</code> handlers:</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>(Note that early beta &ldquo;releases&rdquo; suffered from issues that would often prevent their display; these issues have been remedied in advance of the eventual full release.)</p>
<p>However, this blog entry is about a different kind of C++ exception metadata: namely, <code>wind</code> and <code>unwind</code>. In the remainder of this blog entry, we introduce <code>wind</code> and <code>unwind</code> metadata &ndash; what it is, and when and why the compiler inserts it &ndash; before describing how to exploit it when reverse engineering C++ programs.</p>
<h2 id="c-object-model-destructors">C++ Object Model: Destructors</h2>
<p>Although C++ exception support encompasses just three language keywords, its implementation is complex and requires substantial runtime support from the compiler and operating system. C++ guru Herb Sutter authored a trilogy of books on the subject, spanning a total of 810 pages! The complexity primarily comes from the interplay between exceptions and two other C++ language features, namely, constructors and destructors.</p>
<p>Leaving exceptions aside for the moment, in the C++ object model, the compiler is obligated to insert calls to object destructors when their lifetimes end. In the context of stack-allocated local variables, this is the end of their enclosing scope. Let&rsquo;s consider a simple <code>struct</code> with a constructor and a destructor:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Arbitrary type with a constructor and destructor
struct A {
  int val;
  A(int x) : val(x) { printf(&#34;A::A(%d)\n&#34;,  val); }
  ~A()              { printf(&#34;A::~A(%d)\n&#34;, val); }
};
</code></pre><p>And a small function that constructs two of these objects:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void h() {
  A a0(0);
  A a1(1);
}
</code></pre><p>If we were to execute function <code>h</code>, we would see the following output:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>A::A(0)
A::A(1)
A::~A(1)
A::~A(0)
</code></pre><p>Although the function <code>h</code> does not explicitly destroy its two local objects <code>a0</code> and <code>a1</code>, we see from the output that their destructors do in fact run at the end of the function. This is because the compiler implicitly inserts those calls at the end of the objects&rsquo; lifetimes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void h() {
  A a0(0);
  A a1(1);

  // NEW: Auto-generated destructor calls at lifetime end
  a1.~A();
  a0.~A();
}
</code></pre><h2 id="exceptions-and-destructors">Exceptions and Destructors</h2>
<p>Building from previous examples, let&rsquo;s investigate what happens when we introduce exceptions into the object model. Like the previous function <code>h</code>, function <code>f</code> below constructs two objects of type <code>A</code>. However, this time, there are three locations within <code>f</code> that might throw an exception, which I have labeled as points <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void f() {
  // Point -1
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;-1: no exn\n&#34;);

  // Construct A object a0
  A a0(0);
  // Point 0
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;0: no exn\n&#34;);

  // Construct A object a1
  A a1(1);
  // Point 1
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;No exn anywhere %d %d\n&#34;, a0.val, a1.val);
  
  // Auto-generated destructor calls at lifetime end
  a1.~A();
  a0.~A();
}
</code></pre><p>In non-exceptional circumstances, i.e., when the function returns normally, execution will reach the destructor calls at the bottom. If any call to <code>may_throw</code> causes an exception, the function <code>f</code> will not execute any of its remaining code, and will instead exit early and propagate the exception into its caller. That means that, in exceptional circumstances, the destructor calls for local objects <code>a0</code> and <code>a1</code> at the bottom of the function will not execute.</p>
<p>At first glance, this might seem like a major problem. If destructor calls were skipped because of exceptions, we should expect resource leaks and other resource management issues (for example, deadlocks upon failure to release thread synchronization primitives). It is very important that the compiler still call the destructors for local objects when exceptions are thrown.</p>
<p>To add additional complexity, depending upon which call to <code>may_throw</code> throws an exception, the compiler has different obligations as to which local objects it must destroy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Point <code>-1</code>: no objects were created, so nothing needs to be (nor should or can be) destroyed.</li>
<li>Point <code>0</code>: <code>a0</code> must be destroyed, but <code>a1</code> must not be, since <code>a1</code> was not constructed at point <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Point <code>1</code>: both <code>a1</code> and <code>a0</code> must be destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these complexities, because we added <code>printf</code> statements to <code>A</code>&rsquo;s constructor and destructor, we can see that the compiler nevertheless manages to call the correct destructors:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// OUTPUT: exception thrown at point -1
[no output]

// OUTPUT: exception thrown at point 0
-1: no exn
A::A(0)
A::~A(0)

// OUTPUT: exception thrown at point 1
-1: no exn
A::A(0)
0: no exn
A::A(1)
A::~A(1)
A::~A(0)

// OUTPUT: no exception thrown
-1: no exn
A::A(0)
0: no exn
A::A(1)
No exn anywhere 0 1
A::~A(1)
A::~A(0)
</code></pre><p>The correct destructor calls execute, despite that execution never reaches the destructor calls at the bottom of the function (which we could confirm by setting breakpoints in a debugger, for example).</p>
<p>Exceptions cause object lifetimes to end prematurely, and exceptional control flow bypasses the destructor calls that the compiler inserts at the end of objects&rsquo; ordinary, non-exceptional lifetimes. Yet, as we have seen, the compiler also has some mechanism for invoking destructors in the presence of exceptions. What is this mechanism?</p>
<h2 id="wind-states">Wind states</h2>
<p>What actually happens is that the C++ compiler emits special <code>wind</code>/<code>unwind</code> metadata to ensure that the destructors are called. These <code>__wind</code> and <code>__unwind</code> blocks are effectively invisible <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> blocks that ensure destructors are called in the event of exceptional control flow. Internally, MSVC will transform our example akin to the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void f() {
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;-1: no exn\n&#34;);

  A a0(0);
  // NEW: wind block for a0
  __wind {
    may_throw();
    printf(&#34;0: no exn\n&#34;);

    A a1(1);
    // NEW: wind block for a1
    __wind {
      may_throw();
      printf(&#34;No exn anywhere %d %d\n&#34;, a0.val, a1.val);
    }
    // NEW: unwind handler for a1
    __unwind {
      // Destroy a1 if exception at point 1
      a1.~A();
    }
    a1.~A();
  }
  // NEW: unwind handler for a0
  __unwind {
    // Destroy a0 if exception at point 0 or 1
    a0.~A();
  }
  a0.~A();
}
</code></pre><p>Perhaps the functionality of these <code>__wind</code> and <code>__unwind</code> blocks would be clearer if we rewrote them with the standard <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> constructs:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void f() {
  // Point -1
  may_throw();
  printf(&#34;-1: no exn\n&#34;);

  A a0(0);
  // NEW: try instead of __wind
  try {
    may_throw();
    printf(&#34;0: no exn\n&#34;);

    A a1(1);
    // NEW: try instead of __wind
    try {
      may_throw();
      printf(&#34;No exn anywhere %d %d\n&#34;, a0.val, a1.val);
    }
    // NEW: catch instead of __unwind
    catch ( ... ) {
      a1.~A();
      // NEW: Re-throw the exception so the next catch block gets it
      throw;
    }
    a1.~A();
  }
  // NEW: catch instead of __unwind
  catch ( ... ) {
    a0.~A();
    // NEW: Re-throw the exception out of the function
    throw;
  }
  a0.~A();
}
</code></pre><p>As we see, an <code>__unwind</code> handler is effectively a <code>catch</code> handler that catches any exception, destroys an object, and then throws the exception to the next handler up the chain. The compiler inserts them to guard the lifetimes of local stack objects in case exceptional control flow would skip their ordinary destructor calls.</p>
<p>Thus, we have resolved the mystery of why the compiler is able to destroy locally-allocated objects in spite of exceptional control flow and lack of <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> blocks: because the invisibly-inserted <code>__wind</code> and <code>__unwind</code> blocks play the roles of <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> and ensure the proper destructors are called.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-very-briefly">Implementation, Very Briefly</h2>
<p>This blog entry is not a treatise on how MSVC implements C++ exception machinery on the binary level. However, long-time IDA users are likely familiar with seeing messages about function chunks at the top of functions in the disassembly listing (and seeing those chunks as additional entrypoints in the graph view), as follows:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/76003231-26d4-4ea8-afd5-f8cac492cc90/func-with-chunks.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Not all function chunks come from C++ exception handlers, but in IDA up to the latest version 8.4, C++ <code>catch</code> and <code>__unwind</code> handlers are shown as function chunks such as these. (In IDA 9.0, MSVC x64 C++ <code>catch</code> and <code>__unwind</code> handlers are now defined as standalone functions, so they will no longer be shown as function chunks.)</p>
<h2 id="exceptions-and-constructors">Exceptions and Constructors</h2>
<p>So far, we have seen that MSVC inserts so-called <code>__unwind</code>/<code>__wind</code> metadata to ensure that destructors of locally-held stack objects shall be called when exceptions are thrown. These are not the only circumstances in which such metadata is emitted.</p>
<p>Suppose that the constructor for a <code>struct</code> or <code>class</code> object calls functions that might throw exceptions. This idea may seem unusual, but constructors often allocate memory via calls to <code>operator new</code>, which throws <code>std::bad_alloc</code> upon allocation failure. Therefore, the constructor of any data field that calls <code>operator new</code> would qualify. This is another potentially problematic circumstance: any fields constructed prior would need to be destroyed before the exception were propagated out into the calling function, or else their resources would leak.</p>
<p>To be concrete, consider the following <code>struct</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>struct two_lists {
  std::list&lt;int&gt; l0;
  std::list&lt;int&gt; l1;
};
</code></pre><p>Its automatically-generated constructor body would look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>two_lists::two_lists() {
  // Point -1
  this-&gt;l0.std::list&lt;int&gt;();
  // Point 0
  this-&gt;l1.std::list&lt;int&gt;();
};
</code></pre><p>Much like the previous examples, if an exception were thrown at point <code>0</code>, we would have constructed <code>l0</code>, and we would need to destroy it before propagating the exception into the caller. The compiler inserts <code>__wind</code>/<code>__unwind</code> metadata to ensure this happens:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>two_lists::two_lists() {
  this-&gt;l0.std::list&lt;int&gt;();
  __wind {
    this-&gt;l1.std::list&lt;int&gt;();
  }
  // Ensure l0 is deleted if exception while constructing l1
  __unwind {
    this-&gt;l0.~std::list&lt;int&gt;();
  }
};
</code></pre><h2 id="hex-rays-90-support-1">Hex-Rays 9.0 Support</h2>
<p>Hex-Rays 9.0 also has support for displaying <code>wind</code> and <code>unwind</code> information (although the default is not to show that metadata, for reasons we will discuss later).</p>
<p>For example, here is the function that we used as a running example when introducing <code>wind</code> constructs:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/d112e849-a5db-4d17-b86f-2014e6e3b51d/hr-wind-example-plain.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Note the message at the top informing the user that <code>wind</code> states were present but hidden. If one were to right-click anywhere in the function, they would see the option to show <code>wind</code> states:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/0c8ec37a-f109-4af6-a811-c9c6908bc59c/hr-wind-example-right-clickj.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Then the <code>wind</code> states would appear in the decompilation:</p>

</p>
<h1 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse Engineering</h1>
<p>Now that we have discussed the background, let&rsquo;s talk about when and why <code>wind</code> metadata is useful for reverse engineering. As we shall see, sometimes it is very useful, and sometimes less so.</p>
<p>As we have learned, MSVC emits <code>wind</code> metadata within constructors to ensure cleanup if an exception causes the constructor to terminate early. The <code>wind</code> metadata shows destructors for sub-objects contained within the one being constructed. This is useful because it gives three types of extra information about a <code>struct</code>/<code>class</code> and its members:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information about the <code>struct</code>/<code>class</code> member types.</li>
<li>Evidence of substructure nesting relationships for contained objects.</li>
<li>Inheritance relationships that would otherwise be hidden.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="field-types">Field Types</h2>
<p>In the introduction, I lamented the &ldquo;scavenger hunt&rdquo; nature of structure reconstruction in C++. Namely, we often work with limited information about a <code>struct</code>, and we must follow pointers around to fill in missing details. Locating a constructor for the <code>struct</code> type often provides a lot of information about its overall contents, but nevertheless, important and useful information is often still absent from constructors. Locating a destructor for a <code>struct</code> type can help fill in the missing details, but it is not always easy to find a destructor given a constructor or vice versa. (For example, objects can be allocated anywhere in the program with <code>operator new</code>; to find the corresponding destructor, we would need to find a location where the object were destructed via <code>operator delete</code>.)</p>
<p>This example comes from the constructor of the top-level <code>class</code> used by ComRAT (for which I previously released a <a href="https://www.msreverseengineering.com/blog/2020/8/31/an-exhaustively-analyzed-idb-for-comrat-v4">fully reverse engineered IDB</a>). It calls a sub-function to return a pointer, which it writes into offset <code>+72</code> in the <code>this</code> pointer <code>a1</code>.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/a9f6e83a-508b-4011-a0dc-2cf6773c2994/cr-ctor1.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Looking into the called function, we see an allocation of <code>0x30</code> bytes, where that same pointer is written to offsets <code>+0</code> and <code>+8</code> of its own allocation (hallmarks of a doubly-linked list node):</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/17212ee8-e00f-4e91-8413-5b6d7ca40142/cr-ctor2.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>However, we are clearly missing information about this object. The allocation is <code>0x30</code> bytes in size, but the previous function only initializes its first <code>0x10</code> bytes. What is in the other <code>0x20</code> bytes? At present, we can only describe the allocated type with the following incomplete <code>struct</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>struct list_node_0x30_unknown {
  list_node_0x30_unknown *_Next;
  list_node_0x30_unknown *_Prev;
  char gap10[0x20]; // HERE: incomplete information
};
</code></pre><p>To fill in the contents of <code>gap10</code>, we now have to go on a scavenger hunt to find other places this <code>struct</code> field is used &ndash; exactly the type of thing that makes reverse engineering C++ programs so tedious.</p>
<p>But, if we were to enable <code>wind</code> states, we would see that the constructor enters into a <code>wind</code> state immediately afterwards:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/67602e95-bed2-46f0-a56e-e7867876dcbf/cr-ctor3.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Upon looking into the <code>unwind</code> handler, we are immediately presented with accesses to fields within the <code>gap10</code> region:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/9949e94e-c45a-494d-9eb7-295d107c9956/cr-ctor4.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>The seasoned observer will recognize those extra accesses as a <code>std::wstring</code>, which is <code>0x20</code> bytes. So now we can tell more specifically that offset <code>+72</code> in the main <code>struct</code> holds a <code>std::list&lt;std::wstring&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This pattern is generally true for C++ STL template containers such as <code>vector</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>set</code>, and <code>deque</code>. Their default constructors give limited or no information about the templated element types contained therein: only the element type&rsquo;s size, and in the case of <code>vector</code>, not even that. Conversely, destructors for STL containers call the destructors for the contained elements, thereby giving us more detailed information about the element type. By displaying <code>wind</code> states when analyzing the constructor, we get the best of both worlds!</p>
<h2 id="structure-nesting">Structure Nesting</h2>
<p>Another task when recovering <code>struct</code>s is to determine when fields are contained within nested <code>struct</code>s. When the constructors of contained <code>struct</code>s are inlined into the outer <code>struct</code>&rsquo;s constructor, this information is blurred. For example, the same constructor function from the last example begins by writing two <code>QWORD</code>s to offsets <code>+0</code> and <code>+8</code>:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/3bdf0fb0-bc58-4354-8b30-4121efca1015/cr-nested1.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>It could be the case that the outer <code>struct</code> contains two fields at offsets <code>+0</code> and <code>+8</code>. It could also be the case that the outer <code>struct</code> begins with an inner <code>struct</code> at <code>+0</code> that contains two fields at offsets <code>+0</code> and <code>+8</code>. Due to inlining, we are unable to differentiate between these two possibilities.</p>
<p>But, the constructor enters into a <code>wind</code> state after initializing those fields. We can see that the <code>this</code> pointer itself, i.e., at offset <code>+0</code>, is passed to the <code>unwind</code> handler. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in the <code>unwind</code> handler:</p>
<p>
<figure>

</p>
<p>Because of the highlighted access, we know that the type of <code>a1</code> contains a <code>QWORD</code>-sized field at <code>+8</code>. That means that <code>a1</code> points to a <code>struct</code> that is at least <code>16</code> bytes (and seemingly at most <code>16</code> bytes, because there are no accesses beyond the one at <code>+8</code>). We conclude that the first two fields are not members of the outer <code>struct</code>, but rather, are members of a contained <code>struct</code> that begins at offset <code>+0</code> in the outer one.</p>
<p>This example was simple. <code>wind</code> metadata can also provide rich information about inlined constructors in the presence of multiple nesting levels.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance-relationships">Inheritance Relationships</h2>
<p>Yet another task in <code>class</code> recovery is to determine accurate inheritance relationships. One can often determine that two <code>class</code>es are related by looking at which VTables are installed in the constructor and/or destructor. Following cross-references to VTables can help locate related <code>class</code>es.</p>
<p>However, MSVC performs optimizations that can obscure these relationships. For example, if the VTable pointer for a given <code>class</code> is overwritten multiple times in a constructor, the compiler can sometimes eliminate the earlier writes, thereby obscuring the actual base <code>class</code>es for the <code>class</code> being constructed.</p>
<p>This is another situation where <code>wind</code> metadata can provide additional information. Here we see one VTable being written early in the function, and that, upon <code>unwind</code>, a different VTable pointer is written to the same location:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/7b7fbd92-4690-4b28-bb1c-20cd5adb6488/cr-vtable1.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>This information would not be present in the decompilation, or even the disassembly listing, were it not for us displaying the <code>wind</code> metadata. And now, we can exploit that information by looking at cross-references to the ancestral VTable, to discover other locations in the code that construct or destruct potentially-related <code>class</code> types:</p>
<p>
<figure>

<h1 id="non-constructor-functions">Non-Constructor Functions</h1>
<p>The conclusion of the preceding section is that <code>wind</code> metadata is an unambiguous win when analyzing C++ constructors. <code>wind</code> metadata is a rich source of information that was hiding in plain sight all along. It assists in rapidly analyzing C++ <code>class</code>es, assuming their constructor is known. I recommend enabling it always when you know you are looking at a constructor.</p>
<p>However, this blog entry introduced <code>wind</code> metadata in the context of non-constructor functions. For them, the advantages of displaying <code>wind</code> metadata is mixed. To see this, consider the following function:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/234dcf67-acc3-4d1f-aba7-bc1323b5f8ab/cr-unwind-meh.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Note that there are two local objects of type <code>A</code>, called <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code>. Immediately after creating these objects, the function enters into <code>wind</code> states. Immediately before their lifetimes end, the function exits those <code>wind</code> states. However, because the outer function and the <code>unwind</code> handlers both call the same destructor functions, we do not gain any new information about the types of those objects. All the <code>wind</code> metadata really does for us here is to clarify the lifetime of those objects &ndash; at the expense of 7 extra lines of decompiler output per <code>wind</code> state.</p>
<p>For this reason, the default behavior in Hex-Rays 9.0 is to hide <code>wind</code> states by default, but to inform the user that they exist, and make it easy for them to enable or disable their display.</p>
<p>Those caveats aside, <code>wind</code> metadata can still be useful when analyzing non-constructor functions, because <code>unwind</code> handlers are separate functions that cannot be inlined into the main function. To see this, consider the following function from <code>ComRAT</code>:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53a64cc2e4b0c63fc41a3320/f10c4395-c1b8-4f54-bf09-7a0685637cee/cr-unwind-alright.png?format=1000w" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>In this case, the destructor for <code>a4</code> has been inlined into the main function (at the bottom of the snippet), but the <code>unwind</code> handler invokes the destructor as a dedicated function call. This is useful because we can apply a name and types to the destructor in the <code>unwind</code> handler. Hex-Rays can use this type to automatically apply a type to <code>a4</code>. Because the destructor in the function body is inlined, even if we as analysts manually recognize the destruction logic, there is nothing for us to apply a type to to cause Hex-Rays to apply type information in other functions. Moreover, because there is an actual function call, we as analysts see a nice, informative function name rather than a messy blob of inlined code. (It also makes the physical <code>struct</code> boundaries and the <code>struct</code> lifetime more clear, which can help recovering local <code>struct</code> types in complex functions with large statck frames.)</p>
