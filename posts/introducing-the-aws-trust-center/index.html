			<h1>Introducing the AWS Trust Center</h1>

				<p>At Amazon Web Services (AWS), earning trust isn’t just a goal—it’s one of our core Leadership Principles that guide every decision we make. As CISO of AWS, I’ve seen firsthand how this commitment to earning trust shapes our culture, our services, and our daily interactions with customers. Customers choose AWS over other providers because they trust us to provide the most secure infrastructure and services, and to tell them exactly how data is being protected.</p>
<p>To make that information even easier to find, we’re launching the AWS Trust Center, a new online resource that shares how we approach securing your assets in the cloud. The AWS Trust Center is a window into our security practices, compliance programs, and data protection controls that demonstrates how we work to earn your trust every day.</p>
<h2 id="building-on-a-foundation-of-trust">Building on a foundation of trust</h2>
<p>Security has been our top priority since day one. When we launched AWS in 2006, we designed our infrastructure as the most secure cloud computing environment available. We knew we couldn’t just offer the same level of security as existing on-premises infrastructure. To earn customer trust, we had to disrupt and exceed the exacting industry standards of the world’s most security-conscious organizations. We continue to constantly reinforce security in our everyday decision making. With the Trust Center, we’re making it easier for you to understand how we protect your workloads, safeguard your data, and help you meet your compliance goals.</p>
<p>The Trust Center reflects our belief that more easily accessible information builds and maintains trust. Whether you’re looking for information about our data center controls, checking compliance certifications, or reviewing our shared responsibility model, you’ll now find the security and compliance information you need in one central location.</p>
<h2 id="a-single-source-of-truth-for-security-and-compliance">A single source of truth for security and compliance</h2>
<p>In the Trust Center, you’ll find information about our approach to security at every level—from our physical data centers to our cloud infrastructure and our portfolio of cloud services. We’re including documentation about our security services and tools, helping you to understand both how we secure the cloud and how we help you secure your workloads within it. You’ll also find information about our compliance programs, including the certifications and attestations we maintain globally. This is valuable for teams working in regulated industries who need to demonstrate compliance to auditors and regulators.</p>
<p>The Trust Center highlights information about our data protection and privacy practices. Customers can learn how we protect your data and how we manage encryption. Further, we understand that customers are concerned about who can access their data and under what circumstances. We’ve consolidated detailed information about our operator access controls, which are designed to use the principle of least privilege at their core. You’ll learn about our zero-access designs for key services like AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), our use of forward access sessions (FAS) to cryptographically enforce customer authorization, and our global monitoring systems.</p>
<p>The Trust Center provides a central place to find information about service health and security events, so you have the information you need to maintain operational excellence. You can stay up-to-date on security bulletins, and check real-time service health status. If you need to report a security concern or conduct your own security assessment, we’ve made those processes even easier to find. Resources are organized for ease of access, with direct links to the agreements, documentation, and resources you need to make informed decisions about your cloud security posture.</p>
<h2 id="empowering-customers-to-drive-secure-innovation">Empowering customers to drive secure innovation</h2>
<p>What excites me most about the Trust Center is how it removes barriers for our customers. With detailed security information, easier links to compliance documentation, and operational insights now at your fingertips, you can move faster and innovate with confidence.</p>
<p>As we continue to innovate and expand AWS services, we’re committed to enhancing the Trust Center with the latest security information. This is a living resource that will evolve alongside our cloud and services. Maintaining your trust isn’t just about what we’ve built today—it’s about demonstrating, through both our commitments and delivery, that we’re worthy of being your trusted security partner. That’s our commitment to you, and that’s what the AWS Trust Center represents.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore the AWS Trust Center today, and we look forward to continuing to earn your trust, every day.</p>
