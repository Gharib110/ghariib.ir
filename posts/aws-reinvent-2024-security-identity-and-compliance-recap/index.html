				<p>AWS re:Invent 2024 was held in Las Vegas December 2–6, with over 54,000 attendees participating in more than 2,300 sessions and hands-on labs. The conference was a hub of innovation and learning hosted by AWS for the global cloud computing community.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we cover on-demand sessions and major security, identity, and compliance announcements that were unveiled leading up to and during the conference. Whether you missed the event or want to revisit the key takeaways, we’ve compiled the essential information for you to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in AWS security, identity, and compliance. This year’s event put best practices for zero trust, generative AI–driven security, identity, and access management, DevSecOps, network and infrastructure security, data protection, and threat detection and incident response at the forefront.</p>
<h2 id="key-announcements">Key announcements</h2>
<p>For identity and access management, we launched multiple new features that can help you scale permissions management across your AWS Organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource control policies (RCPs) – RCPs are a new type of organization policy that can be used to centrally create and enforce preventative controls on AWS resources in your organization. Using RCPs, you can centrally set the maximum available permissions to your AWS resources as you scale your workloads on AWS.</li>
<li>Centrally manage root access – With central management for root access, you now have a capability to centrally manage your root credentials, simplify auditing of credentials, and perform tightly scoped privileged tasks across your AWS member accounts managed using AWS Organizations.</li>
<li>Declarative policies – Declarative policies simplify the way you enforce durable intent, such as baseline configurations for AWS services within your organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon Cognito announced four new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature tiers – Amazon Cognito launched two user pool feature tiers: Essentials and Plus. The Essentials tier offers comprehensive and flexible user authentication and access control features, helping you to implement secure, scalable, and customized sign-up and sign-in experiences. The Plus tier offers threat protection capabilities against suspicious sign-ins for customers who have elevated security needs for their applications.</li>
<li>Developer-focused console – Amazon Cognito now offers a streamlined getting-started experience featuring a quick wizard and use case–specific recommendations. This approach helps you set up configurations and reach your end users faster and more efficiently than ever before.</li>
<li>Managed Login – This feature is a fully managed, hosted sign-in and sign-up experience that you can personalize to align with your company or application branding. Managed Login helps you offload the undifferentiated heavy lifting of designing and maintaining custom implementations such as passwordless authentication and localization.</li>
<li>Passwordless authentication – With passwordless authentication, you can secure user access to your application with passkeys, email, and text messages. If your users choose to use passkeys to sign in, they can do so using a built-in authenticator, such as Touch ID on Apple MacBooks and Windows Hello facial recognition on PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To discover security issues in your environment, Amazon GuardDuty launched Extended Threat Detection, a capability that you can use to identify sophisticated, multi-stage threats targeting your AWS accounts, workloads, and data. You can now use new threat sequence findings that cover multiple resources and data sources over an extensive time period, allowing you to spend less time on first-level analysis and more time responding to critical severity threats to minimize business impact.</p>
<p>Amazon OpenSearch Service now offers a zero-ETL integration with Amazon Security Lake, enabling you to query and analyze security data in-place directly through OpenSearch Service. This integration allows you to efficiently explore voluminous data sources that were previously cost-prohibitive to analyze, helping you streamline security investigations and obtain comprehensive visibility of your security landscape. With the flexibility to selectively ingest data and without the need to manage complex data pipelines, you can now focus on effective security operations while potentially lowering your analytics costs.</p>
<p>AWS Security Incident Response is a new service that helps you respond to security issues in your environment. This new service combines the power of automated monitoring and investigation, accelerated communication and coordination, and direct 24/7 access to the AWS Customer Incident Response Team to quickly prepare for, respond to, and recover from security events.</p>
<p>In the zero trust space, AWS Verified Access AWS Verified Accessand Amazon VPC Lattice both launched support for accessing non-HTTPS resources. Verified Access enables you to provide secure, VPN-less access to your corporate applications over protocols such as TCP, SSH, and RDP. With the launch of VPC Resources for Amazon VPC Lattice, you can now access your application dependencies through a VPC Lattice service network. You’re able to connect to your application dependencies that are hosted in different VPCs, accounts, and on-premises using additional protocols, including TLS, HTTP, HTTPS, and now TCP. Watch the on demand session to learn how you can enable zero trust access over non-HTTP(S) protocols by using AWS Verified Access.</p>
<p>Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall launched an advanced firewall rule that has a new set of capabilities that you can use to monitor and block suspicious DNS traffic associated with advanced DNS threats.</p>
<p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud launched block public access, which is a one-click declarative control that admins can implement centrally to authoritatively block internet traffic for each of their VPCs.</p>
<p>As more and more customers deploy generative AI workloads into production, it’s important to have proper security controls. Amazon Bedrock launched two new features to help with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated Reasoning checks – Automated Reasoning checks help detect hallucinations and provide a verifiable proof that a large language model response is accurate. With Automated Reasoning checks, domain experts can more straightforwardly build specifications called Automated Reasoning Policies that encapsulate their knowledge in fields such as operational workflows and HR policies. Users of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can validate generated content against an Automated Reasoning Policy to identify inaccuracies and unstated assumptions, and explain why statements are accurate in a verifiable way.</li>
<li>Multimodal toxicity detection (Preview) – Amazon Bedrock Guardrails now supports multimodal toxicity detection for image content, enabling organizations to apply content filters to images. This capability, now in public preview, removes the heavy lifting required to build your own safeguards for image data or spend cycles with manual evaluation that can be error-prone and tedious.</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS has continued to work closely with partners to help drive customer success. There were three new partner programs launched at AWS re:Invent:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI Security category – The AI Security category in the AWS Security competency helps you identify AWS Partners with deep experience securing AI environments and defending AI workloads against advanced threats. Partners in this category are validated for their capabilities in areas such as prevention of sensitive data disclosure, prevention of injection threats, security posture management, and implementing responsible AI filtering.</li>
<li>AWS Security Incident Response Specialization – Today, AWS customers rely on various third-party tools and services to support their internal security incident response capabilities. To better help both customers and partners, AWS introduced AWS Security Incident Response, a new service that helps you prepare for, respond to, and recover from security events. Alongside approved AWS Partners, AWS Security Incident Response monitors, investigates, and escalates triaged security findings from Amazon GuardDuty and other threat detection tools through AWS Security Hub. Security Incident Response is designed to identify and escalate only high-priority incidents.</li>
<li>Amazon Security Lake Ready Specialization – This specialization recognizes AWS Partners who have technically validated their software solutions to integrate with Amazon Security Lake and demonstrated successful customer deployments. These solutions have been technically validated by AWS Partner Solutions Architects for their sound architecture and proven customer success.</li>
</ul>
