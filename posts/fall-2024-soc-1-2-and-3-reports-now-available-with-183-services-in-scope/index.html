				<p>We continue to expand the scope of our assurance programs at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and are pleased to announce that the Fall 2024 System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1, 2, and 3 reports are now available. The reports cover 183 services over the 12-month period from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, so that customers have a full year of assurance with the reports. These reports demonstrate our continuous commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for cloud service providers.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will issue SOC reports covering a 12-month period each quarter as follows:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th><strong>Report</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Period covered</strong></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Spring SOC 1, 2, and 3</td>
          <td>April 1–March 31</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Summer SOC 1</td>
          <td>July 1–June 30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Fall SOC 1, 2, and 3</td>
          <td>October 1–September 30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Winter SOC 1</td>

      </tr>
  </tbody>
