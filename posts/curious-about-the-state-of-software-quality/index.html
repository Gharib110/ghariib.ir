<p>We’ve just released the first edition of the JetBrains Qodana Software Quality Report which looks at key findings from 2024. We decided to conduct this research to gain a deeper understanding of best practices for delivering quality software today, and how companies of different sizes and maturity levels determine when their product is production-ready.</p>
<p>To this end, we surveyed 808 software developers, QA engineers and other technical professionals to document real-world feedback from all corners of the software development community. This, resulted in unexpected findings all of which are unpacked in this comprehensive, 26-part report.</p>

<h2 id="a-taste-of-whats-inside">A taste of what’s inside</h2>
<p>The report showcases a shift in intensity with regards to code quality, as products evolve from launch to maturity, which we can see in a marked increase in using quality gates, testing priority and </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The use of <em>automated quality gates</em> increased from 27% in the development stage to 40% after launch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The larger the development team, the more priority was placed on automated tests. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>52% of partipants said they faced technical challenges and 45% said organizational and process challenges, even if there was companywide consensus on implementing code quality measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>argument for improving quality processes was clear</strong> in terms of returns cited and offers a compelling narrative for how software development is evolving with <strong>improved product reliability and performance</strong> and so much more. </p>
