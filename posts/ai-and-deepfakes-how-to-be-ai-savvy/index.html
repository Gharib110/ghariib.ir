				<p>From the apps on our smartphones to chatbot assistant services, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our lives in both big and small ways. But as exciting as AI can be, it’s also important to understand its potential risks. October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, making it the perfect time to become more cyber-savvy about AI. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>AI is a technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. In everyday life, AI is behind many of the technologies we use. It powers recommendations on streaming TV services like Netflix, improves photo quality on your smartphone, and even aids in driving cars. AI is like having a smart assistant that can process information quickly, automate daily tasks, and make technology more intuitive.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-for-everyday-life">What are the benefits for everyday life?</h2>
<p>AI offers plenty of benefits that can make our lives easier—often without us even realizing it. Here are a few everyday examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart shopping</strong><br>
Ever notice how your online shopping recommendations seem to know exactly what you want? That’s the power of AI at work analyzing your preferences and making product suggestions that match your tastes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual assistants</strong><br>
Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant are some of the most popular examples of AI-powered virtual assistants that simplify daily tasks through voice commands. These assistants can do things like set reminders, send texts, play music, and even provide weather updates..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personalized content</strong><br>
Whether you’re binge-watching a new TV show or scrolling through social media, AI algorithms like Netflix’s recommendation system tailor content based on your interests, ensuring you see things you’re likely to enjoy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-drawbacks-of-ai">The drawbacks of AI</h2>
<p>The convenience AI offers can be amazing, but with great power comes great responsibility. As AI becomes more sophisticated, criminals are finding ways to exploit it, particularly in the area of identity theft and misinformation. One of the biggest concerns today is the rise of deepfakes.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-deepfakes">What are deepfakes?</h2>
<p>Deepfakes are media—like photos, videos, and audio clips—created using AI to manipulate real footage or voices. These can be highly realistic, which makes it difficult to tell what’s genuine and what’s fake.</p>
<p>For example, imagine seeing a video of a public figure saying something controversial. At first glance, it might look entirely believable. However, with deepfake technology, their face, voice, and even gestures could have been artificially generated.</p>
<p>Chances are, you’ve already encountered content created by AI—whether it’s in the form of fake social media posts or altered videos. Cybercriminals can use deepfakes for malicious intent to spread misinformation, ruin reputations, or commit fraud. Criminals can also use them to impersonate individuals in video calls or to fake authority figures to carry out scams.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-be-savvy-with-ai">How to be savvy with AI</h2>
<p>Since AI deepfakes are so lifelike, they pose a threat to our ability to trust digital content, especially as the technology continues to improve. So, how can you protect yourself from AI-driven scams like deepfakes? It’s all about becoming more aware and taking the time to analyze what you see online.</p>
<p>One useful approach to help you sort truth from fiction is to use the <strong>SIFT method</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Stop</strong> – Take a moment to pause before you react to information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigate the source</strong> – Is the information coming from a reliable and trustworthy source?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find better coverage</strong> – Look for other news outlets or websites that cover the same topic. Do they all report the same thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trace the original context</strong> – Make sure the story or video hasn’t been taken out of context or manipulated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The overall idea is to slow down and do your research before accepting information as true. By applying the SIFT model, you can spot deepfakes more easily and avoid falling for misleading content.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-your-identity-from-ai-driven-threats">Protecting your identity from AI-driven threats</h2>
<p>As AI technology advances, so do the tactics used by cybercriminals. They can use deepfakes to trick you into revealing sensitive information or falling for scams that seem remarkably genuine. To safeguard your identity from these AI-driven threats, here are four essential tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Shield your computer and smartphone</strong><br>
Make sure your devices are protected with antivirus software and firewalls. Also, always update your operating systems and apps to close security gaps that hackers could exploit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use identity protection services</strong><br>
Services like Webroot’s identity protection help you monitor for suspicious identity theft activity, keeping an eye on things like the Dark Web, financial transactions, and credit bureau data. You’ll get an alert if there’s any unusual activity so you can act quickly before any serious damage is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Polish your password practices</strong><br>
Using weak or repetitive passwords makes it easier for hackers to break into your accounts. Use strong, unique passwords for each account, and consider using a password manager to help you keep track of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t overshare on social media</strong><br>
The more personal information you share online, the more cybercriminals have to work with. Avoid posting things like your full name, birthdate, and home address. Cyber thieves can use these details to steal your identity or gain access to your accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>AI has the power to make our lives easier, but it also opens the door to new kinds of threats. By becoming more cyber-savvy, you can enjoy the benefits of AI while staying safe from its risks.</p>
<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, take the time to protect yourself and your identity from the growing influence of AI. After all, in today’s digital world, a little extra caution can go a long way in keeping you and your personal information secure.</p>
