<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A bare-metal hypervisor, also known as a Type 1 hypervisor, is a virtualization software installed directly on computing hardware, controlling both the hardware and one or more guest operating systems (guest OSes).</p>
<p>This technology has significantly contributed to the transformation of IT infrastructure through efficient resource utilization and scalability, as detailed in our article on the <a href="/resources/articles/benefits-of-virtualization#what-is-virtualization">benefits of virtualization</a>. By directly interacting with hardware, bare metal hypervisors enhance performance and security, making them a crucial tool for enterprise IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>In this article, you will learn about the benefits and use cases of bare metal hypervisors, comparing them to hosted hypervisors to highlight their importance.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-bare-metal-hypervisor"><a href="#what-is-a-bare-metal-hypervisor">What is a Bare Metal Hypervisor?</a><a href="#what-is-a-bare-metal-hypervisor"></a></h2>
<p>A bare metal hypervisor, also known as a Type 1 hypervisor, is virtualization software installed directly on a server’s physical hardware. Unlike a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/Type-2-hypervisor-hosted-hypervisor">hosted hypervisor</a>, it doesn’t require a separate operating system to function. Instead, it is the primary layer between the hardware and the virtual machines (VMs).</p>

<p>When installed, a bare metal hypervisor:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1. Boots directly from the server hardware.

2. Allocates system resources such as [CPU](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/cpu-vs-gpu), memory, and storage to virtual machines.

3. Manages the operation of each VM independently, ensuring isolation and security.

<h3 id="2-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bare-metal-hypervisors"><a href="#2-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bare-metal-hypervisors">2. What are the disadvantages of bare metal hypervisors?</a><a href="#2-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bare-metal-hypervisors"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>Dedicated servers (bare metal) tend to be more expensive than shared or virtualized environments.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Managing and updating firmware, drivers, and hardware can require specialized expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Dependence</strong></p>
<p>Scaling often involves buying or upgrading physical servers, which can be slower compared to spinning up new virtual machines in a cloud environment.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>Without virtualization, you can’t easily move workloads or snapshot entire systems for quick recovery.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-an-example-of-bare-metal-virtualization"><a href="#3-what-is-an-example-of-bare-metal-virtualization">3. What is an example of bare metal virtualization?</a><a href="#3-what-is-an-example-of-bare-metal-virtualization"></a></h3>
<p>A typical example is deploying a Type 1 hypervisor (such as <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/vsphere">VMware ESXi</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-overview?pivots=windows-server">Microsoft Hyper-V</a>) directly on the physical server. These hypervisors run directly on the hardware. They provide virtual machines without needing a separate host operating system.</p>
<h3 id="4-can-containers-run-on-bare-metal"><a href="#4-can-containers-run-on-bare-metal">4. Can containers run on bare metal?</a><a href="#4-can-containers-run-on-bare-metal"></a></h3>
<p>Yes, <a href="/community/conceptual-articles/introduction-to-containers">containers</a> (e.g., Docker containers) can run on a <a href="/products/bare-metal-gpu">bare metal server</a>. In this setup, you first install an operating system on the hardware. Then, you add container runtime software on top of it.</p>
<p>The containers then share the host OS kernel instead of using their own virtual hardware. This approach often performs better than running containers inside a VM, due to fewer layers of abstraction.</p>

<p><strong>Type</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p><strong>Resource Control</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hardware Sharing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bare Metal</strong></p>
<p>Dedicated physical server</p>
<p>Full control over hardware resources</p>
<p>No sharing</p>
<p><strong>VPS (Virtual Private Server)</strong></p>
<p>Virtual machine sharing physical resources</p>
<p>Limited control over shared resources</p>
<p>Shared with other VPS instances</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bare metal</strong>: You have a dedicated physical server all to yourself. You control all the hardware resources and can install any OS or hypervisor directly on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPS (Virtual Private Server)</strong>: Your environment is hosted on a virtual machine that shares physical resources with other VPS instances. Though it behaves like a dedicated server, the underlying hardware is shared, which can lead to contention for resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-a-bare-metal-hypervisor"><a href="#6-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-a-bare-metal-hypervisor">6. What are the main benefits of using a bare metal hypervisor?</a><a href="#6-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-a-bare-metal-hypervisor"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>High Performance</strong>: Direct access to hardware without the overhead of a host OS.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Isolation</strong>: Each VM is isolated at the hardware level, reducing the attack surface.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Control</strong>: You can precisely allocate CPU, memory, storage, and network resources.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Adding or removing VMs can be more straightforward when the hypervisor directly controls physical resources.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="7-how-do-bare-metal-hypervisors-improve-performance-and-security"><a href="#7-how-do-bare-metal-hypervisors-improve-performance-and-security">7. How do bare metal hypervisors improve performance and security?</a><a href="#7-how-do-bare-metal-hypervisors-improve-performance-and-security"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: By running directly on the hardware, there is minimal overhead compared to Type 2 hypervisors. This low-latency access to CPU, memory, and storage leads to near-native performance levels for virtual machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Each VM is isolated at the hypervisor level, reducing the risk of cross-VM attacks. Because there’s no extra host operating system to exploit, the attack surface is smaller. Security patches and updates focus specifically on the hypervisor firmware and management tools.</p>
</li>
</ol>
