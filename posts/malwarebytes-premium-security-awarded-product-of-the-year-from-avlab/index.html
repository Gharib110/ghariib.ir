				<p>Malwarebytes Premium Security has once again been awarded “Product of the Year” after successfully blocking 100% of “in-the-wild” malware samples. The samples were deployed in multiple, consecutive third-party tests conducted by the AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation. </p>
<p>AVLab commended Malwarebytes for “providing effective detection and removal of many types of malware, including recovery from cyberattacks”. </p>
<p>The recognition cements Malwarebytes Premium Security’s perfect record of repeatable, trusted, and proven protection for users. It also comes with an additional AVLab certification for “Top Remediation Time”.</p>
<p>The latest results are part of AVLab’s regular “Advanced In-The-Wild Malware Test”.</p>
<p>In 2024, AVLab tested 3,103 unique malware samples against 14 cybersecurity products. Malwarebytes Premium Security detected 3,103 out of 3,103 malware samples, with a remediation time of 17.1 seconds—almost 26 seconds faster than the industry average. </p>
<p>ThreatDown, powered by Malwarebytes, also participated in AVLab’s evaluation, where it similarly blocked 100% of malware samples with a remediation time of 13.7 seconds. </p>
<p>AVLab’s evaluations, which are performed every other month by a team of cybersecurity and information security experts, are constructed to test and compare cybersecurity vendors against the latest malware. To ensure the evaluations reflect current cyberthreats, each round of testing follows three steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Collecting and verifying in-the-wild malware</strong>: AVLab regularly collects malware samples from malicious and active URLs, testing the malware samples to understand their impact to networks and endpoints. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulating a real-world scenario in testing</strong>: To recreate how a real-life cyberattack would occur, AVLab uses the Firefox web browser to engage with the known, malicious URLs collected in the step prior. In the most recent test, AVLab emphasized the potential for these URLs to be sent over instant messaging platforms, including Discord and Telegram. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident recovery time assessment</strong>: With the various cybersecurity products installed, AVLab measures whether the evaluated product detects a malware sample, when it detects a sample, and how long it took to detect that sample. The last metric is referred to as “Remediation Time.” </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Malwarebytes is proud to receive “Product of the Year” and “Top Remediation Time” from AVLab, and is thankful to the third-party tester for its important work in the industry. </p>
