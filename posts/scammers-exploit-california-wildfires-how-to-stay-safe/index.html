<p>The devastating wildfires sweeping through Southern California have left countless neighborhoods in ruins, forcing thousands to evacuate and destroying homes in their path. While many people across the nation are moved to support those affected, this goodwill often becomes a target for opportunistic cybercriminals. McAfee researchers have discovered that social media networks have been flooded with deceptive images, showing how cryptocurrencies can be used to make donations for fire relief efforts. We believe these to be scams trying to dupe consumers. McAfee CTO, Steve Grobman says, “It’s really unfortunate because it’s such a tragic event, and we’re seeing cybercriminals and scammers take advantage of the situation in a whole host of ways, from fake GoFundMe sites to fraudulent campaign donation pages.”</p>

<p>Steve continues, “The use of generative AI has fueled the creation of fake content, like viral images of the Hollywood sign engulfed in flames, which our deepfake detection technology confirmed were AI-generated. These tools are helping scammers misrepresent reality and exploit public emotions. We’ve seen fake accounts impersonating celebrities like Emma Watson and Kim Kardashian, promoting nonexistent charities to deceive people into donating money.”</p>
<p>The average American encounters a staggering <strong>14.4 scam messages and deepfakes</strong> daily through social media, text messages, and emails, according to McAfee’s latest <em>“State of the Scamiverse”</em> report.</p>
<p>Now, think about this: even in your everyday life, that’s a lot of noise to sift through. But when you’re in the chaos of recovering from a disaster like a wildfire—juggling insurance claims, emergency communications, and rebuilding your life—the sheer volume of scams adds another layer of overwhelm. It’s a perfect storm for distraction, making it even easier for cybercriminals to exploit your vulnerability. Here’s what you need to know to protect yourself from scams while providing genuine help to wildfire victims. </p>
<h2 id="why-cyber-scams-spike-during-disasters"><strong>Why Cyber Scams Spike During Disasters</strong> </h2>
<p>Natural disasters and major news events provide fertile ground for cybercriminals. Cliff Steinhauer, Director of Information Security at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, explains that people eager to help during a crisis can act emotionally, skipping necessary steps to verify the legitimacy of donation platforms or relief efforts. </p>
<p>Scammers watch disaster news closely to craft scams tailored to the event. The emotional urgency surrounding a catastrophe like the California wildfires increases the likelihood of falling victim to these attacks. </p>
<p>A recent McAfee survey found that 59% of Americans say they or someone they know has been the victim of an online scam. 84% of these people lost money to the scam, with an average loss of $1,471 – and nearly 1 in 10 scam victims lost over $5,000 </p>
<h2 id="the-most-common-disaster-related-scams"><strong>The Most Common Disaster-Related Scams</strong> </h2>
<p>Many scams during crises fall under the umbrella of social engineering, a tactic where attackers manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or funds. Here are some of the most common schemes to watch out for: </p>
<h3 id="fake-donation-pages"><strong>Fake Donation Pages</strong> </h3>
<p>Scammers often create counterfeit websites or social media posts masquerading as legitimate charities. These pages may look convincing but divert donations into the hands of criminals. </p>
<h3 id="phishing-attacks"><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong> </h3>
<p>Emails, texts, and phone calls pretending to be from government agencies or well-known charities may attempt to steal personal data or payment details. </p>
<h3 id="fraudulent-assistance-offers"><strong>Fraudulent Assistance Offers</strong> </h3>
<p>Victims of disasters are especially vulnerable. Scammers might pose as organizations offering aid, only to harvest sensitive information like bank account details or steal identities. </p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-powered-deception"><strong>Artificial Intelligence-Powered Deception</strong> </h3>
<p>Modern scammers use AI to craft phishing attempts that are harder to spot. Unlike older scams with obvious grammar mistakes, AI-generated messages can appear professional and persuasive. </p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-becoming-scammed"><strong>How to Avoid Becoming Scammed</strong> </h3>
<p>Whether you’re donating to wildfire relief efforts or seeking aid, these steps can help protect you: </p>
<h3 id="verify-charities-and-organizations"><strong>Verify Charities and Organizations</strong> </h3>
<p>Use trusted resources like Give.org or Charity Navigator to confirm the legitimacy of charities. </p>
<p>Platforms like GoFundMe now provide verified lists of fundraisers for disaster relief. </p>
<h3 id="check-urls-and-domains"><strong>Check URLs and Domains</strong> </h3>
<p>Be wary of websites with misspelled URLs or unusual domain extensions. Look for “https” and padlock symbols to confirm the site is secure. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Phishing attempts often come via unsolicited emails, texts, or social media ads. Instead of clicking, go directly to a charity’s official website by typing its address into your browser. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrutinize Social Media Ads</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Not all paid advertisements on platforms like Facebook or Instagram are legitimate. Avoid providing personal or payment information through these channels without verification. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Watch for Vague Appeals</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Be cautious of campaigns that fail to explain how your donation will be used. Reputable organizations are transparent about how funds are allocated. </p>
<p>Steve Grobman states, “If consumers want to help with relief efforts, they should always go to validated organizations and use payment methods with protections, like credit cards. Wiring money or using cryptocurrency can make it nearly impossible to recover funds if it turns out to be fraudulent. While many GoFundMe sites are legitimate, scammers exploit the platform’s low barrier to entry. Consumers should verify campaigns with the individuals or families they claim to support or stick to reputable charities.”</p>
<p>In the aftermath of California wildfires, staying vigilant is essential. While most people are dedicated to recovery and support, a few may attempt to exploit the situation. By learning to spot common scams and taking proactive steps, you can safeguard yourself and your community from additional harm. Use a robust and trustworthy scam detection tool. McAfee can block risky sites even if you accidentally click a link in a scam text. When it comes to text messages, our smart AI puts a stop to scams before you click—detecting any suspicious links and sending you an alert.</p>
<p>In an age where deepfake technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated, protecting yourself from manipulated videos, audio, and images is critical. McAfee Deepfake Detector is designed to safeguard individuals and organizations by identifying and alerting you to potential deepfakes, ensuring that you can trust what you see and hear online.</p>
