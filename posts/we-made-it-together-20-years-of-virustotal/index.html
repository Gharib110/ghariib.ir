				<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>We can hardly believe it, but VirusTotal is turning 20 on June 1st! As we sit down to write this, we’re filled with a mix of pride and gratitude. It&rsquo;s been an incredible journey, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be here without the amazing community that has supported us every step of the way.</p>
<p>When we started VirusTotal, our goal was simple: to help make the internet a safer place. We never imagined that two decades later, we&rsquo;d be here celebrating this milestone with all of you. From the early days to now, it&rsquo;s always been about working together. Whether you&rsquo;re a user, a contributor, or a supporter, you&rsquo;ve played a crucial role in our success.</p>

</p>
<p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve had the privilege of collaborating with some of the brightest minds in cybersecurity. We&rsquo;ve received support and guidance from industry leaders who believed in our mission and helped us grow. To mark this special occasion, we reached out to a few of these key figures to share their thoughts and memories about VirusTotal. Their testimonials highlight the power of community and collaboration:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;VirusTotal has consistently tackled tough challenges in cybersecurity. By assisting them with detailed analyses and organizing the first-ever VirusTotal training in Japan, I&rsquo;ve seen their impact firsthand. Celebrating their integration into Google&rsquo;s parent company was a milestone. As VirusTotal marks 20 years, it&rsquo;s clear they&rsquo;ve become essential for detecting malware and supporting cyber threat intelligence. Their contributions are invaluable to security personnel. I hope the younger generation continues this vital work, ensuring VirusTotal thrives for another 20 years.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>“Over the past 20 years, VirusTotal, or VT to most of us, has evolved from a simple multi-scanner to a key source of security intelligence. It is relied on by security companies as well as security professionals. Beyond that, VT has been a reliable partner from the very beginning. They have always been ready and willing to add features and APIs to make using their services and integrating it into both products and workflows easier. The vast wealth of data analytics and historical data on files and families, has permanently stitched VT into the fabric of security intelligence. I cannot wait to see what the next 20 years of innovation will produce. Congratulations on the first 20 years!”</em></p>

<p><em>“When the first multi-scanner systems went online, we could not have imagined how quickly a simple way to get multiple scanner opinions would become a substantial building block for our daily malware analysis work. VirusTotal&rsquo;s amazing and comprehensive analyses have not only become an indispensable part of our analyzer work but have also become an essential building block for our threat intelligence services.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Over the past 20 years, VirusTotal, or VT to most of us, has evolved from a simple multi-scanner to a key source of security intelligence. It is relied on by security companies as well as security professionals. Beyond that, VT has been a reliable partner from the very beginning. They have always been ready and willing to add features and APIs to make using their services and integrating it into both products and workflows easier. The vast wealth of data analytics and historical data on files and families, has permanently stitched VT into the fabric of security intelligence. I cannot wait to see what the next 20 years of innovation will produce. Congratulations on the first 20 years!”</em></p>

<p><em>“Microsoft believes security is a team sport and the integration of SysInternals with VirusTotal has made it easier to analyze malware and share those results to improve security for all. In addition, Microsoft Defender XDR uses VirusTotal reports as an accurate threat intelligence source, and VirusTotal uses detections from Microsoft Defender antivirus as a primary source of detection”</em></p>
