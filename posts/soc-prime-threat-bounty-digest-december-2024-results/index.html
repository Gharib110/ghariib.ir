<h2 id="detection-content-creation-submission--release">Detection Content Creation, Submission &amp; Release</h2>
<p>December was another impressive month for the Threat Bounty Program, with the community showcasing a collaborative spirit and detection engineering skills.</p>
<p>Despite the end-of-year hustle, Program members continued actively submitting detections to address emerging threats. In total, 33 new detection rules were successfully released to the SOC Prime Platform after being validated by the team of SOC Prime’s experts.</p>

<p>Starting January 2025, we have temporarily suspended the acceptance of new Threat Bounty detections.

See details here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the SOC Prime community can explore the SOC Prime Platform membership plans for individual users and incorporate some of the platform’s premium functionalities into their detection engineering projects. </p>
