			<h1>Announcing the 2024 Steering Committee Election Results</h1>
			<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>

				<p>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.</p>
<p>This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.</p>

<p>This governing body, like all of Kubernetes, is open to all. You can follow along with Steering Committee meeting notes and weigh in by filing an issue or creating a PR against their repo. They have an open meeting on the first Monday at 8am PT of every month. They can also be contacted at their public mailing list <a href="mailto:steering@kubernetes.io">steering@kubernetes.io</a>.</p>
<p>You can see what the Steering Committee meetings are all about by watching past meetings on the YouTube Playlist.</p>
