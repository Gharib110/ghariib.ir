				<p>At GitLab we have a tradition: Every year, we invite a bug bounty hunter to join us for an AMA. This year, we met with Alexander Siyou Tan, also known as ahacker1, and did a deep dive into all aspects of bug bounty hunting.</p>
<h2 id="about-alexander-ahacker1">About Alexander (ahacker1)</h2>
<p>Alexander is passionate about hacking complex SaaS applications, with a particular interest in authorization-based vulnerabilities. Currently, he&rsquo;s focusing on SAML and SSO research. His hacking journey began during the Covid-19 pandemic, when he transitioned from gaming to exploring game hacks and easter eggs.</p>
<h2 id="highlights-from-the-ama">Highlights from the AMA</h2>
<p>Here are some of the questions AMA attendees asked Alexander, and his responses.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tools you use in your research?</strong></p>
<p>I use RubyMine as my IDE, as I find it helps with analyzing code. You can jump to different parts of the code, and that helps with efficiency and allows you to search quickly and determine interesting behavior. I used to just use BurpSuite, but not so much anymore. I mainly focus on using JetBrains to review repositories on GitLab.</p>
<p><strong>Have you explored using AI to assist in finding and/or exploiting vulnerabilities?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! When I learn about a new feature or subject, I may ask ChatGPT how it works. It may give some insights or leads – when I do SAML research I use it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about moving into SAML and the experience of finding the awesome bugs in that area.</strong></p>
<p>SAML is like a SaaS application within a SaaS application. There&rsquo;s a 100-page document on how SAML works, offering infinite possibilities. I focus on code analysis, reviewing the approximately 20 libraries available. While hacking SAML can be time-consuming due to setup and configuration, the payoff can be significant.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next after SAML? Will you keep digging?</strong></p>
<p>I will fix SAML. I want to fix libraries. Not sure what’s next - maybe SSO stuff!</p>
<h3 id="alexanders-tips-for-the-gitlab-bug-bounty-program">Alexander&rsquo;s tips for the GitLab Bug Bounty Program</h3>
<p>Alexander offered the following advice for those interested in GitLab&rsquo;s Bug Bounty Program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leverage GitLab&rsquo;s open source nature for code analysis.</li>
<li>Study patch releases to learn reverse-engineering techniques.</li>
<li>Review GitLab&rsquo;s public issues and disclosed reports for insights.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="getting-to-know-our-hacker">Getting to know our hacker</h3>
<p><strong>What do you do when you don&rsquo;t hack?</strong></p>
<p>I play games, I also go out on walks and explore nature/hike. It’s a nice break from sitting at the computer.</p>
<p><strong>How long do you think you would survive in a zombie apocalypse?</strong></p>
<p>Not long. Without the internet, I don’t think I&rsquo;d be able to adapt.</p>
<p><strong>Is cereal a type of soup?</strong></p>
<p>It most definitely is. It has both liquid and food in it.</p>
<h2 id="watch-the-replay">Watch the replay</h2>

<p>We extend our gratitude to all participants and, of course, to Alexander for sharing his insights. Keep up with Alexander&rsquo;s latest activities on his HackerOne profile.</p>
