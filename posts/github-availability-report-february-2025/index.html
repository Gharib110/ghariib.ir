<p>In February, we experienced two incidents that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.</p>
<p><strong>February 25 14:25 UTC (lasting 2 hours and 19 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>On February 25, 2025, between 14:25 UTC and 16:44 UTC, email and web notifications experienced delivery delays. At the peak of the incident, the delay resulted in ~10% of all notifications taking over 10 minutes to be delivered, with the remaining ~90% being delivered within 5-10 minutes. This incident was caused by worker pools running too close to capacity at peak times, resulting in a delay in queue processing.</p>
<p>We mitigated the incident by scaling out the service to meet the demand. We’ve since established a higher baseline capacity to ensure no further delays occur, and we are improving our capacity planning to proactively manage our pool going forward.</p>
<p><strong>February 3 18:01 UTC (lasting 30 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>On February 3, 2025, at 18:01 UTC, an incident was declared due to failures in our Migration Tools. The root cause was traced to a deployment of a system component, which led to missing Docker images, causing a 100% outage for all users attempting migrations in this window. The issue was mitigated by rolling back to the previous stable version, restoring service within approximately 30 min.</p>
<p>We have enhanced our test coverage and our workflows to ensure validation of critical dependencies.</p>
