				<p>Authorities in the UK, US, and Australia have sanctioned sixteen individuals linked to Evil Corp, a group once considered the pinnacle of global cyber threats.</p>
<p>This move exposes their connections to the Russian state and other infamous ransomware groups, including LockBit. The National Crime Agency(NCA) also shared the news on Social Platform X.</p>

<h2 id="unveiling-the-faces-behind-evil-corp"><strong>Unveiling the Faces Behind Evil Corp</strong></h2>
<p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) has played a pivotal role in unraveling the complex web of Evil Corp’s operations.</p>
<p>Originating as a family-centered financial crime group in Moscow, Evil Corp evolved into a formidable cybercrime entity, extorting over $300 million from victims worldwide.</p>
<p>Their targets spanned critical sectors such as healthcare, government, and national infrastructure.</p>

<p>In 2019, the US indicted Maksim Yakubets, Evil Corp’s head, Igor Turashev, and several other members.</p>
<p>The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office has sanctioned these individuals.</p>
<p>This new wave of sanctions includes previously unidentified members like Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Yakubets’ trusted lieutenant and a known LockBit affiliate.</p>

<p>The sanctions are part of a broader international effort to dismantle Evil Corp’s operations.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment against Ryzhenkov for deploying BitPaymer ransomware across American targets. Meanwhile, Australia has joined in imposing sanctions against these cybercriminals.</p>
<p>The NCA’s Director General for Threats, James Babbage, emphasized the importance of these actions: “These sanctions expose further members of Evil Corp and those critical to enabling their activity.</p>
<p>We expect these new designations to disrupt their ongoing criminal activity.”</p>

<h2 id="the-russian-connection"><strong>The Russian Connection</strong></h2>
<p>Evil Corp’s ties to the Russian state have been well-documented. Eduard Benderskiy, Yakubets’ father-in-law and a former high-ranking FSB official, was instrumental in fostering this relationship.</p>
<p>Before 2019, Russian Intelligence Services reportedly tasked Evil Corp with executing cyber attacks against NATO allies.</p>
<p>Following US sanctions in 2019, Benderskiy leveraged his connections to shield Evil Corp’s senior members from Russian authorities.</p>
<p>Despite this protection, the group faced significant operational disruptions and was forced to adapt its tactics.</p>
<p>Evil Corp’s strategies shifted post-2019 sanctions. They moved from widespread attacks to targeting high-value organizations using new ransomware strains like WastedLocker and Hades.</p>
<p>Some members even collaborated with other crime groups, like LockBit, for technical tools.The NCA continues to track former Evil Corp members involved in ransomware activities.</p>
<p>The international investigation into LockBit remains active, with recent arrests in France and Spain highlighting ongoing efforts to dismantle their operations.</p>
<h2 id="global-leaders-respond"><strong>Global Leaders Respond</strong></h2>
<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated: “Today’s sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks.”</p>
<p>Security Minister Dan Jarvis added, ” Cybercrime causes immense damage globally, but today’s action shows there are serious consequences for those involved.”</p>
<p>Jonathon Ellison of the NCSC urged organizations to follow ransomware guidance: “Every day we see ransomware incidents have real-world consequences… I welcome today’s sanctions against Evil Corp-affiliated actors.”</p>
