<p>It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers, Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks.</p>
<p>Experts said the targeting was a “zero-click” attack, which means targets would not have had to click on any malicious links to be infected.</p></blockquote>
