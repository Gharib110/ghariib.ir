				<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce a successful completion of the 2024 Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalogue (C5) attestation cycle with 179 services in scope. This alignment with C5 requirements demonstrates our ongoing commitment to adhere to the heightened expectations for cloud service providers. AWS customers in Germany and across Europe can run their applications in the AWS Regions that are in scope of the C5 report with the assurance that AWS aligns with C5 criteria.</p>
<p>The C5 attestation scheme is backed by the German government and was introduced by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in 2016. AWS has adhered to the C5 requirements since their inception. C5 helps organizations demonstrate operational security against common cybersecurity threats when using cloud services.</p>
<p>Independent third-party auditors evaluated AWS for the period of October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024. The C5 report illustrates the compliance status of AWS for both the basic and additional criteria of C5. Customers can download the C5 report through AWS Artifact, a self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. Sign in to AWS Artifact in the AWS Management Console, or learn more at Getting Started with AWS Artifact.</p>
<p>AWS has added the following 10 services to the current C5 scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Application Recovery Controller</li>
<li>Amazon DataZone</li>
<li>AWS Entity Resolution</li>
<li>AWS Mainframe Modernization</li>
<li>AWS Payment Cryptography</li>
<li>Amazon Q Business</li>
<li>Amazon Q Developer</li>
<li>Amazon Security Lake</li>
<li>AWS Verified Access</li>
<li>Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client</li>
</ul>
<p>The following AWS Regions are in scope of the 2024 C5 attestation: Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Milan), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Spain), Europe (Zurich), and Asia Pacific (Singapore). For up-to-date information, see the C5 page of our AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program**.**</p>
<p>AWS strives to continuously bring services into the scope of its compliance programs to help you meet your architectural and regulatory needs. If you have questions or feedback about C5 compliance, reach out to your AWS account team.</p>
