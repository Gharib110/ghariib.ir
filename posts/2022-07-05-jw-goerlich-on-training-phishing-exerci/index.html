<p>What are the goal of these tests?</p>
<p>    That someone will click and activate (is that not a given?)</p>
<p>What made them popular in the first place?</p>
<p>Is this an example of management not taking security seriously, so we needed proof?</p>

<p>FTA: “This will only undermine the efforts of cybersecurity teams as a whole, alienating the very people they aim to engage with, Barker adds. “People generally don’t like to be tricked, and they don’t usually trust the people who trick them. One counterargument I often hear is that criminals use emotive lures in a phish, so why shouldn’t we? Well, criminals also cause physical damage to property, take systems offline, and disrupt services, but physical social engineers and pen-testers don’t—for good reason. Simulations should not cause active harm.””</p>
<p>Is this part of a larger issue? Why do we treat these tests the way we do?</p>
<p>Typical scenario?<br>
Mgmt does not believe or trust their internal people to tell them what is wrong, and takes a 3rd party source/product to tell them the same thing.</p>
<p>    Are these stories Apocryphal? Or just my experience?</p>
