<p>SOC Prime announces the launch of Uncoder AI Solo, a new personal subscription plan designed for individual detection engineers, threat hunters, and cybersecurity researchers. Previously exclusive to corporate clients, Uncoder AI is now available to independent professionals via instant Stripe purchase. Subscribe today and enjoy 50% off an annual plan for your yearly Uncoder AI Solo access. Stay tuned and follow us for more exciting updates and upcoming announcements! </p>
<p>Uncoder AI acts as a private IDE and co-pilot for detection engineering helping security professionals to easily create, customize, and translate detection rules. Backed by collective industry expertise and powered by AI, Uncoder streamlines detection code development and boosts translation productivity. Hosted in a SOC Prime’s SOC 2 Type II cloud, with full respect to authorship rights under Detection Rule License, Uncoder AI serves you a fully private and secure environment, with no string of your code shared with third parties. </p>
<h2 id="empower-detection-content-development">Empower Detection Content Development</h2>
<p>Uncoder AI empowers security professionals to optimize their detection engineering workflow by automating daily tasks and enabling full CI/CD with API access. Detection rules can be built from scratch, created using pre-built templates, or customized from a library of community-contributed rules. Uncoder AI streamlines the process with intelligent rule code autocompletion and ATT&amp;CK tagging, all powered by private, green, and compute-efficient Machine Learning. Additionally, security experts can access broad rule intelligence or enrich detections with optional AI integration to expand on metadata, without sharing detection code. Finally, to ensure the highest rule quality, Uncoder performs 60+ syntax and logic checks, providing real-time autofix.</p>
<h2 id="enhance-translation-productivity">Enhance Translation Productivity</h2>
<p>Uncoder AI serves as a powerful translation engine, allowing security professionals to effortlessly convert Sigma rules into 46 SIEM, EDR, and Data Lake native languages with a single click. Alternatively, experts can utilize cross-platform translation to seamlessly convert between platform-native formats, bridging the gaps between disparate cybersecurity technologies. Additionally, researchers can paste threat intelligence in any non-binary format, and Uncoder AI automatically packages it into custom IOC-based queries for seamless retrospective IOC matching. The platform also offers easy remapping to OCSF standards, ensuring smooth integration across systems.</p>
<h2 id="invest-in-detection-engineering">Invest in Detection Engineering</h2>
<p>While leveraging Uncoder AI to advance detection engineering workflows, security experts can also support community collaboration across the industry. With 10% of Uncoder AI Solo revenue dedicated to supporting expert Threat Bounty contributions, every user plays a part in encouraging collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the continuous growth of Uncoder’s rule library.</p>
<p>Trusted by 50,000 Detection Engineers, Threat Hunters, and Threat Intelligence Analysts, Uncoder AI is now available for you at its full power. Explore now in the SOC Prime Platform!</p>
