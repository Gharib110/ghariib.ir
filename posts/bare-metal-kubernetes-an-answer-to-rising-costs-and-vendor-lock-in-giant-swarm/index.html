			<h1>Bare metal Kubernetes: an answer to rising costs and vendor lock-in »  Giant Swarm</h1>

			<div>
				<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hearing from infrastructure teams: they&rsquo;re tired. Tired of complexity. Tired of unpredictable costs. Tired of feeling locked into decisions made years ago. VMware&rsquo;s recent pricing adjustments didn&rsquo;t start these conversations, but they&rsquo;ve brought them into sharper focus. Teams are ready for a simpler approach.</p>
<p>At Giant Swarm, we believe bare metal Kubernetes offers a compelling path forward. By removing the hypervisor layer and embracing the open source flexibility of Kubernetes, businesses can achieve significant cost savings, reduce dependency on single-vendor solutions, and unlock new opportunities for scalability and innovation. </p>
<h3 id="why-consider-bare-metal-now">Why consider bare metal now?</h3>
<p>Running Kubernetes directly on hardware delivers three fundamental advantages that are reshaping how organizations think about their infrastructure:</p>
<h4 id="1-break-free-from-vendor-lock-in">1. Break free from vendor lock-in: </h4>
<p>When your infrastructure runs on open source Kubernetes and bare metal, you gain true independence from vendor roadmaps and decisions. Many proprietary solutions impose restrictions that limit your ability to innovate and adapt. With bare metal, you can avoid these operational limitations and unexpected costs, giving your team the freedom to build what they actually need.</p>
<h4 id="2-cost-efficiency-that-makes-sense">2. Cost efficiency that makes sense: </h4>
<p>Running Kubernetes directly on hardware eliminates an entire layer of licensing and support costs. This isn&rsquo;t just about immediate savings – it&rsquo;s about predictable, scalable costs that align with your actual infrastructure needs. Your budget goes directly toward infrastructure that delivers value rather than licensing overhead.</p>
<h4 id="3-open-standards-open-future">3. Open standards, open future: </h4>
<p>The open source foundation of Kubernetes ensures true interoperability with other tools and platforms. From bare metal to cloud to edge, your infrastructure can evolve without artificial constraints. This flexibility becomes increasingly valuable as your needs change and new technologies emerge.</p>
<h3 id="common-concerns-about-bare-metal">Common concerns about bare metal</h3>
<p>In our conversations with teams considering bare metal, two questions consistently arise:</p>
<h4 id="heading"><em>&ldquo;What about high availability?&rdquo;</em></h4>
<p>Modern Kubernetes provides robust high availability capabilities built right into the platform. Critical workloads stay running reliably, backed by intelligent scheduling and automated management. The platform includes sophisticated features for node failure detection, workload rescheduling, and data replication – all designed for enterprise reliability from the ground up.</p>
<h4 id="heading-1"><em>&ldquo;Can we scale effectively?&rdquo;</em></h4>
<p>Kubernetes on bare metal scales beautifully across environments. Whether you&rsquo;re expanding your on-premises infrastructure, moving workloads to the edge, or growing into the cloud, the platform adapts to support your evolving business needs. Direct hardware access often delivers better performance than virtualized environments, while native networking ensures efficient communication across your infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="the-giant-swarm-difference">The Giant Swarm difference</h3>
<p>We offer more than just Kubernetes – we provide a fully enterprise-ready cloud native developer platform that&rsquo;s entirely managed by our team:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="custom-configuration"><strong>Custom configuration:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just deploy a standard platform – we configure every aspect based on your specific needs, enabling seamless integration into your workflows. Your environment gets exactly what it needs to perform optimally, from basic setup through advanced features.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="managed-applications"><strong>Managed applications:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our application platform provides ready-to-consume, managed applications that let your teams focus on building business value instead of managing foundational tools. We handle the complex integration and maintenance of essential services, ensuring reliable operation all day, every day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="enterprise-support"><strong>Enterprise support:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From initial deployment onward, our team provides 24/7 proactive support. We carry the pager and resolve issues before they impact your business, keeping your platform running smoothly. This hands-on support ensures you get the most from your bare metal infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="flexibility-across-environments"><strong>Flexibility across environments:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you operate in the cloud, on premises, or at the edge, we ensure consistent performance and scalability across all your infrastructure. Your platform works the same way everywhere, simplifying operations and development while maintaining the freedom to evolve.</p>
<h3 id="making-the-move-our-proven-approach">Making the move: Our proven approach</h3>
<p>We understand that transitioning infrastructure is a significant step. Here&rsquo;s how we make it manageable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="start-where-you-are">Start where you are: </h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Cluster API, we deploy our platform alongside your existing infrastructure. This approach lets you build confidence with the new environment while maintaining business as usual. Your teams can learn and adapt at a comfortable pace.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="seamless-transition">Seamless transition: </h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re ready, we take a methodical approach. First, we install the platform on your new bare metal infrastructure. Then, we use Kubernetes&rsquo; built-in capabilities to migrate your workloads from the existing environment to bare metal, minimizing disruption to your operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="move-at-your-pace">Move at your pace:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our phased approach ensures you can transition at a pace that makes sense for your business. No forced timelines – just steady progress toward your infrastructure goals, with our team supporting you at every step.</p>
<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>
<p>The future of infrastructure demands flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency – all built on open source principles. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to reduce dependency on proprietary platforms or build for future growth, bare metal Kubernetes could provide the freedom and control you need.</p>
<p>Remember, this doesn&rsquo;t have to be an all-or-nothing decision. Many teams start by experimenting with bare metal alongside their existing infrastructure, learning and expanding based on their unique needs and goals. We&rsquo;d welcome the opportunity to share more detailed insights from our experience running Kubernetes on bare metal.</p>
