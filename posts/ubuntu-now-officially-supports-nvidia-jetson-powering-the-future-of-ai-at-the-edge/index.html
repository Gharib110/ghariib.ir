<h2 id="introducing-ubuntu-core-for-nvidia-jetson">Introducing Ubuntu Core for NVIDIA Jetson</h2>
<p>Ubuntu Core is a minimal, secure, and strictly confined operating system designed specifically for deploying production images for IoT and edge computing devices.</p>
<p>This ‘immutable’ flavor of Ubuntu puts every system component, and the system itself, into a set of containers with strict kernel-enforced confinement. It supports reliable over-the-air updates with failsafe rollbacks, making it ideal for intelligent edge and IoT applications. Once you have created your application in Ubuntu Desktop or Server, you can now build your immutable Ubuntu Core image based on your developed applications for your NVIDIA Jetson.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Core on NVIDIA Jetson offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production images: Streamline your production with the ability to create custom images for your NVIDIA Jetson applications. </li>
<li>Enhanced security: Built from the ground up with security in mind, ensuring cybersecurity-compliant and trustworthy devices in critical environments.</li>
<li>Efficient device management: Enjoy reliable, remotely accessible devices with mission-critical over-the-air (OTA) and seamless updates.</li>
<li>Agile containerization: Benefit from an immutable and strictly confined system that separates the kernel, OS image, and your applications.</li>
<li>Hardware ecosystem support: Tested and optimized for leading IoT and edge devices, including NVIDIA Jetson.</li>
</ul>
