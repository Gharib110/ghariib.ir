<p>Let’s look at some of the key technologies of GPU Operators in detail.</p>
<h2 id="gpu-concurrency">GPU concurrency</h2>
<p>GPU concurrency is the ability of a GPU to execute multiple operations simultaneously by utilizing its parallel processing capabilities. This feature is essential for enhancing the performance, efficiency, and scalability of AI/ML workloads. With parallel processing, GPUs can significantly speed up training and inference, manage larger and more complex datasets, and provide real-time responses.</p>
<p>vGPU (Virtual GPU), Multi-Instance GPU (MIG), and GPU Time-Slicing are key technologies that enable GPU concurrency in various scenarios and through different mechanisms. Here’s a brief overview of each.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>vGPU</strong>: vGPU enables a single physical GPU to be shared among multiple virtual machines (VMs), each with its own dedicated GPU resources.</li>
<li><strong>MIG</strong>: MIG partitions a single GPU into multiple isolated instances at the hardware level, each with its own dedicated memory and compute resources. This feature is specific to NVIDIA’s A100 and later version GPUs such as H100, H200, B100, B200</li>
<li><strong>GPU Time-Slicing</strong>: GPU Time-Slicing involves dividing the GPU’s processing time among multiple tasks or users, allowing them to share the GPU in a time-allocated manner, very similar to how CPU concurrency works.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gpudirect-rdma-and-gpudirect-storage">GPUDirect RDMA and GPUDirect Storage</h2>
<p>NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) and GPUDirect Storage (GDS) are advanced technologies designed to optimize data transfer for high-performance computing applications. GPUDirect RDMA enables direct communication between GPUs across different nodes, bypassing the CPU and reducing latency. This direct data path is crucial for applications requiring fast, low-latency communication, such as distributed AI training and real-time data processing. By minimizing CPU involvement, GPUDirect RDMA significantly enhances performance and efficiency, enabling faster computations and more scalable AI workloads.</p>

<p>Similarly, GPUDirect Storage facilitates direct data transfer between GPUs and storage devices, bypassing the CPU and system memory. This direct access to storage devices, such as NVMe SSDs, accelerates data throughput and reduces latency, which is essential for data-intensive applications. By streamlining the data flow, GPUDirect Storage ensures that GPUs can quickly access and process large datasets, leading to faster and more efficient computations.</p>

</p>
<p>(GPUDirect RDMA (GDR) Copy)</p>
<p>GDR Copy stands for GPUDirect RDMA Copy, which is a low-latency GPU memory copy library based on GPUDirect RDMA. One of the prominent use-cases for this library is to transfer data between the CPU (host) and GPU when the GPU is waiting to receive data and signal from the host to start the processing operations. GDR Copy uses the GPUDirect RDMA capability of exposing a part of the GPU memory to external devices, such as NICs, CPU, etc. to do CPU driven data copy operations. This enables GDR Copy to execute copy operations between CPU and GPU memory with lower latency and higher throughput, as opposed to GPU driven memory copy operations, such as cudaMemcpy, for small data sizes.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.infracloud.io/assets/img/Blog/nvidia-gpu-operator/host-device-memory-copy-operation.webp" alt="Host-Device memory copy operation using cudaMemcpy and GDR Copy" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>(Host-Device memory copy operation using cudaMemcpy and GDR Copy)</p>
<p>Figure above shows the difference between host-device memory copy operations using GDR Copy vs cudaMemcpy. cudaMemcpy is GPU driven operation and it uses GPU DMA engine to move data. This involves DMA engine overheads for lower data sizes. GDR Copy allows the CPU to access GPU memory directly via BAR mappings, allowing for low latency data transfers.</p>
<h2 id="gpu-operator-crds">GPU Operator CRDs</h2>
<p>The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage the lifecycle of GPU drivers and associated components on Kubernetes. Here are some of the main CRDs.</p>
<h3 id="cluster-policy-crd">Cluster Policy CRD</h3>
<p>The ClusterPolicy custom resource definition (CRD) is central to the NVIDIA GPU Operator. It serves as a single point of configuration for deploying all necessary NVIDIA software components on a Kubernetes cluster. The ClusterPolicy CRD allows administrators to specify and manage the entire lifecycle of GPU-related components, including drivers, runtime, device plugins, and monitoring tools.</p>
<p>The custom resource allows managing the configuration of important properties such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>driver</strong>: Configuration for the NVIDIA driver, including image, version, and repository settings.</li>
<li><strong>toolkit</strong>: Settings for the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, which provides utilities to run GPU-accelerated containers.</li>
<li><strong>devicePlugin</strong>: Configuration for the NVIDIA device plugin, which allows Kubernetes to recognize and schedule GPU resources.</li>
<li><strong>mig</strong>: Parameters for managing Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) configurations on supported hardware.</li>
<li><strong>gpuFeatureDiscovery</strong>: Settings for the GPU Feature Discovery tool, which detects and labels nodes with GPU capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>dcgmExporter</strong>: Configuration for the Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) Exporter, used for monitoring GPU metrics.</li>
<li><strong>validator</strong>: Configuration for the GPU Operator Validator, which ensures all components are properly deployed and functioning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nvidia-driver-crd">NVIDIA Driver CRD</h3>
<p>The NvidiaDriver custom resource definition (CRD) specifically manages the deployment and lifecycle of NVIDIA drivers on the Kubernetes nodes. It ensures that the correct version of the driver is installed and running, compatible with the GPU hardware and Kubernetes environment. While the driver configuration can also be controlled by the Cluster Policy CR, the Driver CR allows to specify the driver type and version per node.</p>
<p>Here are some of the configurations that can be managed with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>image</strong>: Specifies the container image for the NVIDIA driver. This includes the repository, image name, and tag.</li>
<li><strong>repository</strong>: URL or path to the repository containing the driver image.</li>
<li><strong>version</strong>: The specific version of the NVIDIA driver to be deployed.</li>
<li><strong>deploy</strong>: Configuration options for how the driver should be deployed, such as using DaemonSets.</li>
<li><strong>nodeSelector</strong>: Specifies the nodes on which the driver should be installed, usually matching GPU-capable nodes.</li>
<li><strong>tolerations</strong>: Tolerations for node taints, ensuring the driver can be scheduled on tainted nodes if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>resources</strong>: Resource requests and limits for the driver installation pods.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this post, we saw how the NVIDIA GPU Operator is a crucial tool for optimizing and managing GPU resources in Kubernetes clusters, specifically tailored to meet the demanding needs of AI and ML workloads.
