<p>A short while ago, we packaged and pushed out a few important <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-metapackages/">wireless penetration testing tool</a> updates for aircrack-ng, pixiewps and reaver into Kali’s repository. These new additions and updates are fairly significant, and may even change your wireless attack workflows. Here’s a short run-down of the updates and the changes they bring.</p>
<h2 id="pixiewps---bruteforce-wps-pins-in-seconds">Pixiewps - Bruteforce WPS pins in seconds</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wiire-a/pixiewps">Pixiewps</a> is a tool used for offline brute forcing of WPS pins, while exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tSlbqVQ59kGn8hgmwcPTHUECQ3o9YhXR91A_p7Nnj5Y/edit?usp=sharing">wireless access points</a> also known as the <strong>pixie dust attack</strong>, discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/Reversity/status/490978005859454978">Dominique Bongard</a> (<a href="http://archive.hack.lu/2014/Hacklu2014_offline_bruteforce_attack_on_wps.pdf">slides</a> and <a href="http://video.adm.ntnu.no/pres/549931214e18d">video</a>). The pixiewps tool (developed by <a href="https://forums.kali.org/member.php?30454-wiire">wiire</a>), was born out of the Kali forums, and the development of the tool can be tracked throughout an interesting <a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-(Offline-WPS-Attack)">forum post</a>.</p>
<p>In the correct environment, pixiewps dramatically speeds up the WPS brute force attack time from what was taking up to 12 hours to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f6oClT7Wp4">a few seconds</a>. This new attack is mind numbing, and we are somewhat surprised that it hasn’t been discussed on a wider basis. Watch our following video closely, and see how we <strong>extract the WPA shared key of this EdiMAX wireless access point in a few seconds</strong> using updated versions of pixiewps and reaver, already packaged in Kali:</p>
<h2 id="aircrack-ng-v12-rc2-update">Aircrack-ng v1.2 RC2 Update</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/aircrack-ng/">Aircrack-ng</a> is the de facto penetration tool suite - essential for any wireless penetration tests or assessments. In this latest Aircrack-ng release, amongst the normal bug fixes and code improvements there has been a significant change to <strong>airmon-ng</strong>, the tool used to put wireless cards into <em>monitor mode</em>. Other new and notable features are that <strong>airtun-ng</strong> is now able to decrypt WPA as well as several new <strong>airodump-ng</strong> flags, such as <em>- -wps</em> and <em>- -uptime.</em></p>

<p>Also notice the new naming convention of the wireless virtual interfaces - <strong>wlanXmon</strong>, as opposed to <strong>monX</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="goodbye-mon0-hello-wlan0mon">Goodbye mon0, hello wlan0mon!</h3>
<p>For the latest few releases, the <em>aircrack-ng</em> suite had bundled with it <strong>airmon-zc,</strong> which uses an improved method of placing wireless cards into monitor mode, as well as more verbose output options. With the release of Aircrack-ng 1.2 RC2, <strong>airmon-zc</strong> has officially replaced the original <strong>aircrack-ng</strong>, as the new standard.</p>
<h3 id="more-verbose-airmon-ng-output">More verbose airmon-ng output</h3>
<p>When things are going right, everything is great! However when this isn’t the case, and you need to <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-wireless-driver-issues/">troubleshoot wireless issues</a>, you can now use a single command <strong>airmon-ng –verbose start wlan0</strong> to gather all the relent information needed:</p>

<h2 id="updated-reaver-wps-attack-tool">Updated Reaver WPS attack tool</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/reaver/">reaver</a> project was originally developed by Craig Heffner, and the last release was 1.4. As the project seems to have been abandoned, several forks have cropped up - one belonging to a member of the Kali forums, <a href="https://forums.kali.org/member.php?31103-t6_x">t6_x</a>, who has also integrated the pixiewps attack into a newly minted 1.5.2 release. <a href="https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x">This new</a> version implements an array of improvements on the original version, and will hopefully be activity maintained by the community.</p>
<h2 id="the-kali-community-rocks">The Kali Community Rocks</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of being a Kali forum moderator is that you get to witness the community grow and interact. Since the original <a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-(Offline-WPS-Attack)">pixiewps thread</a> started by <a href="https://forums.kali.org/member.php?17496-soxrok2212">soxrok2212</a>, it has received over 300 responses, bringing about the implementation of new ideas and updates to the tool. Watching this project emerge from a single forum post all the way to the release of the tool, and seeing the co-operation between the various tool developers while working to get interoperability between their tools was a real privilege.</p>
<h2 id="stay-fresh-with-kali-linux">Stay fresh with Kali-Linux</h2>
<p>You don’t need to do anything special to get this awesome tool chain, just keep your Kali-Linux up-to-date:</p>
