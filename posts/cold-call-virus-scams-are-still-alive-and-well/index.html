<p>Regular readers of this blog would have seen sagas such as Anatomy of a virus call centre scam, Scamming the scammers – catching the virus call centre scammers red-handed and my personal favourite, “Type www.” – “Ok, w-w-w-d-o-t”; antagonising call centre scammers.

Consequently, it should come as no surprise that once again, this evening I enjoyed the company of a couple of gentlemen willing to help me out with my PC.</p>
<p>As a seasoned recipient of this scam I keep a VM ready for just such events. Unfortunately, in this case I had a tennis game to get to and frankly that was more important then listening to crooks on the other side of the world. I pushed them harder earlier this time and inevitably got hung up on but not before listening to the usual drivel and <em>exactly</em> the same modus operandi as usual.</p>
<p>If you want to see this scam run all the way through to where they want dollars (including having them remotely control my PC), take a look at the Scamming the scammers video (get a nice drink and find a comfy chair first). If you just want to see how the scam still looks today, here’s what my mates are up to:</p>
