				<p><em>We are excited to announce that Palo Alto Networks Cortex™ has achieved FedRAMP High Authorization, marking a significant milestone for government security operations. As the first and only AI-driven SOC platform to secure FedRAMP High Authorization, Cortex empowers federal agencies with industry-leading capabilities to protect their most critical missions.</em></p>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) standardizes the assessment, authorization and continuous monitoring of cloud services, ensuring agencies have access to secure, compliant solutions. Achieving FedRAMP High Authorization demonstrates Cortex’s ability to meet the most stringent security requirements, enabling government agencies to adopt cutting-edge technologies while safeguarding sensitive, unclassified data.</p>
<h2 id="fedramp-high-vs-fedramp-moderate">FedRAMP High Vs. FedRAMP Moderate</h2>
<p>FedRAMP impact levels define the level of risk a breach would pose to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. While FedRAMP Moderate applies to systems handling sensitive but not classified information, FedRAMP High is designed for systems managing highly sensitive data, such as that used in law enforcement, emergency services and healthcare.</p>
<p>With its authorization uplift from Moderate to High, Cortex provides federal agencies with a trusted platform capable of securing the most sensitive workloads, ensuring compliance while delivering faster, more precise threat detection and response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cortex is proud to achieve FedRAMP High Authorization, a milestone that reinforces our leadership in security operations. This achievement empowers federal agencies to modernize their SOCs with the confidence that Cortex delivers unmatched detection, automation and compliance capabilities to protect their most critical missions.</p></blockquote>
