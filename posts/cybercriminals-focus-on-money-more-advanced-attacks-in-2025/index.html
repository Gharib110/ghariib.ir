<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 23, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are expected to reach $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. This represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history and is exponentially larger than the damage inflicted from natural disasters in a year.</p>
<p>If it were measured as a country, cybercrime would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China and will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined.</p>
<p>Digital Risk, Inc. consulted with CISOs, journalists, and threat researchers in order to compile a list of 10 top cybersecurity predictions for 2025. Taken together, this thought leadership is a solid starting point in our annual war on cybercrime.</p>
<p>“While the ultimate goal of making money hasn’t changed, how attacks are conducted to get that money is evolving at a rapid pace,” says Daniel Blackford, Head of Threat Research at Proofpoint. “The steps and methods cybercriminals employ to entice a victim to download malware or issue a payment to a bogus “supplier” now involve more advanced and complex tactics and techniques in their attack chain.”</p>
