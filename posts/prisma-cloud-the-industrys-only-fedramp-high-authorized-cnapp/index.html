				<p><em>Prisma Cloud helps federal agencies and public sector partners achieve the most stringent security standards, as the world’s only cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) to achieve FedRAMP High Authorization on the</em> <em>FedRAMP Marketplace</em>_._</p>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government initiative that standardizes the assessment, authorization and monitoring of cloud services for security. With the goal of promoting use of secure cloud services across the government, FedRAMP helps reduce costs and duplicative efforts, encourage public-private partnerships for innovation and enhanced security, and accelerate the adoption of cloud computing within federal agencies.</p>
