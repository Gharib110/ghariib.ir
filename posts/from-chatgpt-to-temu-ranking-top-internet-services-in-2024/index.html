			<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
		       

			<div>
				<p>Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users&rsquo; needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflare’s observations and a review of the year’s DNS trends.</p>
<p>Building on similar reports we’ve done over the past several years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2024, with the same categories included in 2023, including Generative AI. In addition to our <strong>overall</strong> ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Generative AI</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ecommerce</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video Streaming</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>News</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Messaging</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metaverse &amp; Gaming</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cryptocurrency Services</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have done since 2022, our analysis uses anonymized DNS query data from our 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, used by millions globally. We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesn’t always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service — it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank.</p>
<p>This part of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News.</p>
<p>This year, we’re also including a by-country/region perspective on the most popular Internet services for the first time, showing the Top 10 Overall for 132 countries/regions. At the bottom of this post, we highlight trends found in this localized data, including how ChatGPT performed best in Singapore.</p>
<p>Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year. For more, visit our 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsite. Along with the lists of most popular Internet services, the Year in Review microsite and its associated blog post explore a number of additional metrics.</p>
<h2 id="google-is-again-1-facebook-apple-and-tiktok-follow">Google is again #1. Facebook, Apple and TikTok follow</h2>
<p>Since 2021, we’ve started our review of rankings with an Overall Top 10 list, showcasing the most popular Internet services globally based on DNS traffic from our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (including services like Google Maps and Google Calendar) remained the #1 Internet service in 2024. Since introducing our ranking method two years ago, no other service has come close to challenging Google’s top spot. It’s important to note that Apple and Microsoft are similar to Google in that their main domains (apple.com or microsoft.com) are used for many different services. We include other services separately, such as Outlook or iCloud, which use their own specific domains.</p>
<h3 id="top-10-most-popular-internet-services-in-2024-overall">Top 10 most popular Internet services in 2024, overall</h3>

<p>Amazon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WhatsApp</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond Google, Facebook consistently held the #2 spot throughout 2024. Last year, it competed with Apple for that position. Apple, which uses domains like apple.com for services related to its software and devices, was generally #3. However, TikTok challenged that position on several days since late August. Amazon Web Services (AWS), differentiated from Amazon by domains like amazonaws.com, performed better this year compared to 2023. It held the #5 spot but often traded places with Microsoft during the year.</p>
<p>Instagram also rose in the rankings. It was around #8 in 2023 and steadily improved. Now, it holds the #7 spot, ahead of YouTube.</p>
<p>Amazon remained at #9 for most of the year, the same as in 2023. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, appeared in the Top 10 for the first time, taking the #10 spot.</p>
<p>Close to the Top 10 were Apple’s iCloud, Netflix (which performs better on weekends), and Microsoft’s Outlook.</p>
<p>In the chart below, you can follow the evolution of the top Internet services in our Overall ranking throughout the year.</p>

<p>In 2022, X (then known as Twitter) ranked as high as #10 in our overall ranking and was close to Instagram. It never reached the top 10 in 2023, and in 2024, X dropped further, to #14 or #15. More on X’s performance in the Social Media category below.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-face-the-generative-ai-era">Ready to face the Generative AI era?</h2>
<p>Generative AI gained global attention in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, and became a global phenomenon during 2023. By 2024, ChatGPT (OpenAI) continues to be by far the most popular service in this category, which includes chatbots, coding bots, and more. Other generative AI services had more stable rankings compared to 2023.</p>
<h3 id="top-10-generative-ai-services-in-2024">Top 10 Generative AI services in 2024</h3>

<p>Significant changes occurred below ChatGPT’s first place ranking throughout the year. Character.AI, an AI-driven chatbot platform, maintained a strong #2 position, staying ahead of Codeium, a code-generation AI tool that has improved its position since June, and Quillbot, an AI writing and paraphrasing tool.</p>
<p>Claude, the AI chatbot from Anthropic, rose in the rankings, particularly after March 4, when the new model, Claude 3, was introduced, and again later in May when it became available in Europe. It reached #5 in June. Perplexity, an AI-driven search and Q&amp;A platform, started the year outside the Top 10 but ended close to Claude. It surpassed Claude for the first time on November 6, 2024, the day after the U.S. elections, reaching #6.</p>
<p>This next chart shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="github-copilots-rise-to-the-top-10">GitHub Copilot’s rise to the Top 10</h2>
<p>Several new players entered the Top 10 AI rankings in 2024, showing strong growth. GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November, as the next chart shows. Similarly, Suno AI, an AI-powered audio and music generation platform, entered the Top 10 in April, briefly dropped out, but stabilized between #6 and #10 after October — in November, it ranked #6 on weekends.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Some platforms lost ground in the rankings. Wordtune, an AI writing assistant, peaked at #4 during mid-year but declined afterward. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. In contrast, Sider AI, a coding assistant, entered the Top 20 in March and finished the year around #12. Poe, an AI chatbot platform, ranked #5 in 2023 and between #5 and #6 before June, but ended 2024 moving around #10, performing better during weekends.</p>
<p>Google Gemini, Google’s AI assistant and model, performed better on weekdays and started the year ranking between #7 and #10, but dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face, an open-source AI and machine learning platform, mostly fluctuated between #7 and #9 during the year, peaking at #4 on August 18 around the time several models were updated, and and as it reached its milestone of 5 million users. However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September.</p>
<p>Midjourney, an AI-powered platform for generating images, performed well until June, when it was close to the Top 10. Additionally, the OpenAI API ranked #18 in the Generative AI category on May 14-15, coinciding with OpenAI’s announcement of GPT-4o availability, including in the API.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpts-growth-to-the-top-50-of-our-overall-category">ChatGPT’s growth to the Top 50 of our Overall category</h2>
<p>Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services within our larger Overall ranking include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ChatGPT continued its growth in 2024, similar to 2023. In early 2023, it ranked around #200 and ended the year near the top 100. In 2024, it started close to the top 100, reached the top 60 in May with the release of the 4o model, and has been near the top 50 since September, aligning with the return of workers and students to their routines. It ranks higher on weekdays, averaging #56, and drops on weekends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing ChatGPT with other known and non-AI related websites, by late November, ChatGPT ranked ahead of Weather.com, Temu, eBay, Telegram, Google Calendar, and Prime Video, but trailed Disney Plus</p>
</li>
</ul>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Character.ai also showed a clear growth trend in our Overall ranking, from outside the top 200 earlier in the year, to above #180 after July, performing better in August, reaching as high as #161. The AI-driven chatbot platform performed better on weekends than on weekdays, the opposite of ChatGPT.</p>

<h2 id="social-media-snapchat-closing-in-on-x">Social media: Snapchat closing in on X</h2>
<p>According to Kepios, there are an estimated 5.22 billion social media users worldwide in 2024 (up from 4.95 billion last year), representing 63.8% of the global population. Social media continues to play a major role in daily life, serving as a key platform for communication, information, and attention.</p>
<p>Once again, social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram dominate, ranking among the top 10 most popular Internet services overall.</p>
<h3 id="top-10-social-media-services-in-2024">Top 10 Social Media services in 2024</h3>
<ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>Reddit</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Social Media category rankings, the top seven remain unchanged from last year. However, there are notable developments in this category. In 2022, X briefly challenged Instagram for the #3 spot during a few days. Since 2023, X has held a solid #4 position, with Snapchat closing in and reaching #4 for the first time on several days in September and October.</p>
<p>LinkedIn stayed steady at #6, followed by Discord. Kwai, a Chinese video app popular in Brazil (with 60 million reported users) and other countries (a reported ), rose from #10 last year to #8. Further down the list, Pinterest kept its #9 rank, while Reddit, previously #8 in 2023, dropped to #10 this year, but peaked at #7 on November 26, just before Black Friday and Thanksgiving in the US. Here’s the Social Media Top 10 chart for 2024:</p>
<p>
<figure>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Our global ranking also highlights several non-Western platforms in the Top 20. These include Douyin (#11), the Chinese version of TikTok; VK (#12), often referred to as the Russian Facebook; and TikTok rivals popular in Southeast Asia SnackVideo (#13) by Chinese Kuaishou (that also owns Kwai). OnlyFans appeared consistently in the Top 20 starting in September, ranking around #18 and surpassing Tumblr by late November.</p>
<p>The #18 spot was briefly held by X alternative Threads (by Instagram) in late September and by Bluesky starting November 18. Mastodon-related servers reached as high as #19 for several days since late August. Here’s a look at X (on top) and its alternatives in this category:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-x-bluesky-threads-and-mastodon">Alternatives to X: Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon</h2>
<p>Let’s move beyond the Social Media category to see how these platforms performed in our Overall ranking, where bigger shifts between services are evident.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (via an aggregation of popular servers) didn’t break into the Top 10 of the Social Media category. However, in the Overall ranking, Mastodon servers, bundled together, consistently ranked between #208 and #248, performing better on weekends.</p>
<p>Bluesky entered the Top 250 in September 2024, and gained additional attention after the US elections. It rose sharply after November 14, peaking at #193 on November 20, and has since stabilized around #220. </p>
<p>Threads entered the Top 250 in August 2024, peaking at #183 on September 24 before dropping out in October. In 2023, Threads peaked at #227 in early July but fell out of the Top 250 by late August. It’s worth noting that Threads also uses Instagram’s cdninstagram.com for images and videos, which may influence Threads position in our DNS rankings (that said, Instagram wasn’t impacted by Threads appearance in our rankings).</p>

</p>
<p>Here are some other trends we observed among social media apps, and how they did in our Overall ranking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong>’s best day (#6 in the Overall ranking) was August 5, 2024, coinciding with the week the app was banned in Turkey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>X</strong>’s best day of the year in our ranking was April 14, when it reached #12. This coincided with Arsenal losing the top position in the English football/soccer Premier League (the most-watched sports league in the world) to Manchester City, which went on to win its fourth title in a row. Last year, we noted how football/soccer in England impacted X’s ranking. X also reached #13 on August 9 and 10, during the final weekend of the Paris 2024 Olympics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>X</strong> performed better on weekdays, while <strong>LinkedIn</strong> ranked higher between Mondays and Wednesdays. <strong>Snapchat</strong> and <strong>Discord</strong> performed better on weekends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reddit</strong> consistently stayed in our Top 50 in 2024, showing growth from around #45 to #40 by November, with a peak at #38 on November 26. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quora</strong> displayed a downward trend in our ranking, dropping from around #140 to #160. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tinder</strong>, which performs better on Sundays, started the year around #150 but eventually dropped below #160.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tumblr</strong> followed a similar pattern, dropping out of the Top 200, where it was in early 2024, to outside the ranking entirely since September. Tumblr performed better on weekends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OnlyFans</strong> showed growth in our Overall ranking, sitting around the Top 220 with a peak at #213 on December 1. It performed better on weekends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="e-commerce-temu-means-growth">E-commerce: Temu means growth</h2>
<p>The importance of e-commerce continues to grow, as highlighted in our recent Cyber Week 2024 blog post. Amazon leads the category, followed by Taobao, the Chinese marketplace, holding a steady #2 spot as it also did in 2023. New to #3 is AliExpress, the global online retail giant from China.</p>
<h3 id="top-10-e-commerce-services-in-2024">Top 10 E-commerce services in 2024</h3>

<p>Compared to 2023, eBay lost its #3 spot globally and dropped down to #7, despite starting 2024 at #3 for several days. AliExpress claimed #3, followed by Shopify (#4), the Canadian platform hosting numerous online stores, and Temu (#5). Temu, the low-cost, fast-fashion marketplace launched in the US in September 2022, ended 2023 at #7 but rose to #5 in 2024, occasionally reaching #4 since August. Alibaba dropped to #6 in September.</p>
<p>Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, continued its growth and overtook Mercado Libre (#8) in November. A surprise this year was Wildberries, often called Russia’s “Amazon,”  that has been expanding to several neighboring countries (including some in Europe). It climbed to #10 in September, surpassing OLX (which held #10 for several months), Rakuten, and Lazada.</p>

<h2 id="video-streaming-youtube-and-netflix-remain-uncontested-leaders">Video streaming: YouTube and Netflix remain uncontested leaders</h2>
<p>The relevance of video streaming platforms shows no signs of fading. In 2024, the Top 3 rankings stayed unchanged from 2023, with YouTube firmly holding the #1 spot, followed by Netflix. Among paid streaming services, Netflix leads, trailed by Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Other paid streaming services are outside the Top 10, including, in ranked order: HBO/Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Paramount Plus.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, Disney Plus occasionally challenged Roku, especially on weekends, a trend similar to what was observed in 2023.</p>
<p>Looking at how video streaming services performed in our Overall ranking, we found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Netflix</strong> consistently ranked #12 on most weekends, particularly Sundays, through late May and resumed the same trend after August. Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO/Max were more popular on weekends, especially Sundays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disney Plus</strong> ranged between #50 and #60, with a strong start to the year and a spike to #51 on September 22, coinciding with the premiere of the new Marvel show Agatha All Along.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prime Video</strong> had its best day in the rankings on May 25, at #56, the day the movie Bombshell with Nicole Kidman premiered on the platform.</p>

<p>This year’s rankings in the news category mirrored 2023 at the top. Globo, the Brazilian media giant — one of the largest in Latin America and globally — encompassing radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines, stayed #1, followed by the British BBC at #2, that operates globally and in 42 languages. </p>
<p>The New York Times rose to #3 this year (it was #5 in 2023), overtaking CNN (#4) and Fox News (#5), which dropped from its position at #3 in 2023 and this year came behind CNN.</p>
<p>Several prominent outlets, such as the Washington Post, The Guardian, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal, fell out of the Top 10 this year. These outlets had higher rankings in late 2023 following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict on October 7. News aggregators gained prominence, with Google News (#6) and also Yahoo Finance (#7), focused on financial news (and that came in front of Yahoo News), and NewsBreak (#10), a US-based local news app, entering the Top 10. </p>
<p>The British Daily Mail, which has also expanded its focus to the US and Australia, ranked #8, followed by RT, the Russian news TV network with a global presence. RT launched its Brazil/Portuguese version in late 2023 and was recently highlighted in a report and an alert from the US Department of State regarding its global operations.</p>
<p>The US elections impacted rankings. CNN climbed to #2 on November 5, election day, and reached #1 on November 6, while Fox News peaked at #3. NBC News also improved, reaching #11 on November 5 and #7 the following day. Associated Press ranked #8 on November 5 as well. Here’s the News ranking:</p>

<p>Messaging remains relevant, especially for specific communication purposes. Apple’s iMessage is excluded from this category because it lacks a unique domain name for traffic analysis.

<p>The Internet continues to shape how we socialize, work, and stay informed. Our 2024 rankings highlight the enduring dominance of platforms like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, alongside the rapid rise of generative AI services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, with new players like GitHub Copilot and Claude making strides.</p>
<p>In social media, X shows declining influence, while Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are carving out niches but remain far from overtaking established platforms. Temu continues to rise in e-commerce, while Shein and AliExpress strengthened their global positions. In cryptocurrency, Binance regained momentum as Bitcoin surged, and newer players entered the scene. Gaming saw Roblox maintain its lead, with Steam experiencing notable growth.</p>
<p>Events like the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, US elections, and war-related attacks also shaped Internet trends, emphasizing how global events influence online activity. These trends mirror real-world developments and set the stage for an interconnected, tech-driven future.</p>
<p>On a final note, creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates. We welcome your feedback and suggestions for new categories to explore in the Year in Review.</p>
