<hr>
<p>Customers often require multiple log sources across their AWS environment to empower their teams to respond and investigate security events. In part one of this two-part blog post, I show you how you can use Amazon OpenSearch Service to ingest logs collected by Amazon Security Lake to facilitate near real-time monitoring.</p>
<p>Many customers use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments, software as a service (SaaS) providers, on-premises workloads, and cloud sources into a purpose-built data lake in their AWS environment. OpenSearch Service is a managed service that customers can use to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. It natively integrates with Security Lake to enable customers to perform interactive log analytics and searches across large datasets, create enterprise visualization and dashboards, and perform analysis across disparate applications and logs. With Amazon OpenSearch Security Analytics, customers can also gain visibility into the security posture of their organization’s infrastructure, monitor for anomalous activity, detect potential security threats in near real time, and initiate alerts to pre-configured destinations.</p>
<p>Without using Amazon OpenSearch Service, customers would need to build, deploy and manage infrastructure for an analytics solution, such as an ELK stack.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Security Lake should already be deployed. For details on how to deploy Security Lake, see Getting started with Amazon Security Lake. You will need AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to manage Security Lake, OpenSearch Service, Amazon Cognito, AWS Secrets Manager, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and to create IAM roles to follow along with this post. The solution can be deployed in any AWS Region that has at least 3 Availability Zones, supports Security Lake, OpenSearch, and OpenSearch Ingestion.</p>
<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>The architecture diagram in Figure 1 shows the completed architecture of the solution.</p>
<ol>
<li>The OpenSearch Service cluster is deployed within a virtual private cloud (VPC) across three Availability Zones for high availability.</li>
<li>The OpenSearch Service cluster ingests logs from Security Lake using an OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline.</li>
<li>The cluster is accessed by end users through a public-facing proxy hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.
<ol>
<li>To reduce costs, the template doesn’t deploy a dead letter queue (DLQ) for the OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline. You can add one later if you want.</li>
<li>Instead of a public facing proxy, you can deploy a VPN to access your cluster.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Authentication to the cluster is managed with Amazon Cognito.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="planning-the-deployment">Planning the deployment</h2>
<p>This section will help you plan your OpenSearch service deployment, including what nodes you should choose, the amount of storage to allocate, and where to deploy the cluster.</p>
<h3 id="deciding-instances-for-the-opensearch-service-master-and-data-nodes">Deciding instances for the OpenSearch Service master and data nodes</h3>
<p>First, determine what instance type to use for the master and data nodes. If your workload generates less than 100 GB of Security Lake logs per day, we recommend using three m6g.large.search master nodes and three r6g.large.search data nodes. You can start small and scale up or scale out later. For more information about deciding the size and number of instances, see Get started with Amazon OpenSearch Service. Note the instance types that you have selected on a text editor because you will use this as an input for the AWS CloudFormation template that you will deploy later.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-storage">Configuring storage</h3>
<p>To optimize your storage costs, you need to plan your data strategy. In this architecture, Security Lake is used for long-term log storage. Because Security Lake uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), you can optimize long-term storage costs. You can configure OpenSearch Service to ingest priority logs based on the recent data that you can use for near-real time detection and alerting. Your team can query logs in Security Lake using its Zero-ETL integration with OpenSearch Service to analyze older logs.</p>
<p>Therefore, Security Lake should serve as your primary long-term log storage, with OpenSearch Service storing only the most recent logs.</p>
<p>The number of days of logs in OpenSearch Service will depend on how many days’ worth of data you need to investigate at a given time. I recommend storing 15 days of data in OpenSearch Service. This allows you to react to and investigate the most immediate security events while optimizing storage costs for older logs.</p>
<p>The next step is to determine the volume of logs generated by Security Lake.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the Security Lake delegated administrator account.</li>
<li>Go to the AWS Management Console for Security Lake. Choose <strong>Usage</strong> in the navigation pane.</li>
<li>On the Usage screen, select <strong>Last 30 days</strong> as the range of usage.</li>
<li>Add the total <strong>Actual usage</strong> for the last 30 days for the data sources that you intend to send to OpenSearch. If you have used Security Lake for less than 30 days, you can use the <strong>Total predicted usage per month</strong>. Divide this figure by 30 to get the daily data volume.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2025/01/14/img2.png" alt="Figure 2: Select range of usage" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Figure 2: Select range of usage</p>
<p>To determine the total storage needed, multiply the data generated by Security Lake per day by the retention period you chose, then by 1.1 to account for the indexes, then multiply that number by 1.15 for overhead storage. For more information about calculating storage, see Get started with Amazon OpenSearch Service.</p>
<p>To determine the amount of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage that you need per node, take the total amount of storage and divide it by the number of nodes that you have. Round that number up to the nearest whole number. You can increase the amount of storage after deployment when you have a better understanding of your workload. Make a note of this number in a text editor because you’ll use it as an input in the CloudFormation template later.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> 10 GB of Security Lake logs generated per day, stored for 30 days in OpenSearch Service in three nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>10 GB of Security Lake logs stored for 30 days = 10 GB * 30 = 300 GB</li>
<li>Account for additional space for indexes and overhead space = 300 GB * 1.1 * 1.15 = 379.5 GB</li>
<li>Divide the storage required across three nodes, rounded up = 379.5/3 ≈ 127 GB per node</li>
<li>You would need 127 GB per node in OpenSearch Service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> 200 GB of Security Lake logs generated per day, stored for 15 days in OpenSearch Service across six nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>200 GB of Security Lake logs stored for 15 days = 200 GB * 15 = 3000 GB</li>
<li>Account for additional space for indexes and overhead space = 3000 GB * 1.1 * 1.15 = 3795 GB</li>
<li>Divide the storage required across three nodes, rounded up = 3795/6 ≈ 633 GB per node</li>
<li>You would need 633 GB per node in OpenSearch Service</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-to-deploy-the-cluster">Where to deploy the cluster?</h2>
<p>If you have an AWS Control Tower deployment or have a deployment modelled after the AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA), Security Lake should be deployed in the <em>Log Archive</em> account. Because security best practices recommend that the Log Archive account should not be frequently accessed, the OpenSearch Service cluster should be deployed into your <em>Audit</em> account or <em>Security Tooling</em> account.</p>
<p>You need to deploy your Security Lake subscriber in the same Region as your Security Lake roll-up Region. If you have more than one roll-up Region, choose the Region that collects logs from the Regions you want to monitor.</p>
<p>Your cluster needs to be deployed in the same Region as your Security Lake subscriber be able to access data.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-security-lake-subscriber">Setting up the Security Lake subscriber</h2>
<p>Before deploying the solution, create a Security Lake subscriber in your Security Lake roll-up Region so that OpenSearch Service can access data from Amazon Security Lake.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access the Security Lake console in your Log Archive account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <strong>Subscribers</strong> in the navigation pane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <strong>Create subscriber</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Create subscriber</strong> page, enter a name, such as <code>OpenSearch-subscriber</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>Data Access,</strong> select Under <strong>S3 notification type,</strong> select <strong>SQS queue</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>Subscriber credentials,</strong> enter the AWS account ID for the account you plan to deploy the OpenSearch cluster to, which should be your Security Tooling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter <code>OpenSearchIngestion-&lt;AWS account ID&gt;</code> under <strong>External ID</strong>.</p>
<p>

<p>After the subscriber has been created, you will need to collect information to facilitate the deployment.</p>
<p><strong>To gather necessary information:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the subscriber that you just created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derive the S3 bucket name from the <strong>S3 bucket ARN</strong> and store it in a text editor. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is formatted as <code>arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket name&gt;</code>. The bucket name should look like <code>aws-security-data-lake-&lt;region&gt;-xxxxx</code>.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="deploy-the-solution">Deploy the solution</h2>
<p>To deploy the solution in your Security Tooling account, use a CloudFormation template. This template deploys the OpenSearch Service cluster, OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline, and an AWS Lambda function to initialize the cluster.</p>
<p><strong>To deploy the OpenSearch cluster:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To deploy the CloudFormation template that builds the OpenSearch service cluster, select the Launch Stack button.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2019/06/05/launch-stack-button.png" alt="Select this image to open a link that starts building the CloudFormation stack" />
</figure>


</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the CloudFormation console, make sure that you are in the correct AWS account. You should be in your Security Tooling account. Also make sure that you have selected the same Region as your Security Lake subscriber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a name for your stack. A name like <code>os-stack-&lt;day&gt;-&lt;month&gt;</code> can help you keep track of deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the instance types and Amazon EBS volume size that you noted earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the IP address range that you want to allow to access the proxy’s security group. You should limit this to your corporate IP range. You can set it as <code>0.0.0/0</code> if you want to expose it to the public internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill in the details of the Security Lake bucket and the subscriber Amazon SQS queue ARN, URL, and Region.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, you learned how to plan an OpenSearch deployment with Amazon OpenSearch Service to ingest logs from Amazon Security Lake. With this solution, you’re able to aggregate and manage logs with Security Lake and visualize and monitor those logs with OpenSearch Service. After deployment, monitor the OpenSearch Service metrics to determine if you need to scale this up or out for improved performance. In part 2, I will show you how to set up the Security Analytics detector to generate alerts to security findings in near-real time.</p>
