				<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Like other security and compliance features in AWS, we will deliver PQC as part of our shared responsibility model. This means that some PQC features will be transparently enabled for all customers while others will be options that customers can choose to implement to help meet their requirements. This transition will happen in phases, starting with systems that communicate over untrusted networks such as the internet.</p>
<p>The threat of a large-scale quantum computer, sometimes referred to as a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, is its potential to break the public-key cryptographic algorithms in use today. These algorithms are used in most communication protocols and digital signature schemes. For the past eight years, AWS—along with other industry leaders, government agencies, and academia—has been advocating, researching, and proposing new public-key cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum computing. Because customers rely on cryptography performed by AWS to secure their data, we engaged in this work early on to minimize the effort and the impact of the eventual migration to PQC. While there is no evidence that a quantum computer powerful enough to break the public key cryptography in use throughout AWS exists today, we are not waiting. We would rather put protections in place now to protect the security of our customers’ data into the future.</p>
<p>This post summarizes where AWS is today in the journey of migrating to PQC and outlines our path forward.</p>
<p>For the past five years we’ve deployed early versions of PQC algorithms under evaluation by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in both our open-source libraries and security-critical services to allow customers to test the performance impact of moving to PQC. For example, our open-source library for algorithm implementations (AWS-LC), our implementation of TLS (s2n) and core security services like AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) have had implementations of NIST PQC proposed algorithms for key encapsulation as far back as 2019.</p>
<p>On August 13, 2024, the NIST announced three new post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). This was the result of NIST’s PQC Standardization Process started in 2016. AWS employees are contributors to many of the proposed schemes including the three new FIPS standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>FIPS 203, Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard (ML-KEM), a module lattice-based KEM originally submitted under the name CRYSTALS-Kyber</li>
<li>FIPS 204, Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA), a module lattice-based digital signature algorithm initially submitted as CRYSTALS-Dilithium</li>
<li>FIPS 205, Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA), a stateless hash-based signature scheme that began as SPHINCS+</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of our customers have been tracking the standardization process, including the U.S. Government’s Commercial National Security Algorithms (CNSA) Suite 2.0 requirements around PQC adoption and the European Commission’s Recommendation on a Coordinated Implementation Roadmap for the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography.</p>
<p>Now that the first round of PQC algorithms has been standardized, we can start to implement them for long-term support. Here’s our approach to implementing PQC to provide a seamless transition for our customers who rely on our services and open-source tools to handle cryptographic operations on their behalf.</p>
<p>AWS will take a multi-layered approach to migrating to PQC over the coming years. We define the simultaneous workstreams as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workstream 1</strong>: Inventory of existing systems, identification and development of new standards, testing, and migration planning. While the first set of algorithm standards has been published, there are additional standards to come that will define how PQC should be integrated in specific applications and protocols to ensure interoperability.</li>
<li><strong>Workstream 2</strong>: Integration of PQC algorithms on public AWS endpoints to provide long-lived confidentiality of customer data transmitted to AWS.</li>
<li><strong>Workstream 3</strong>: Integration of PQC signing algorithms into AWS cryptographic services to enable customers to deploy new post-quantum long-lived roots of trust to be used for functions such as software, firmware, and document signing.</li>
<li><strong>Workstream 4</strong>: Integration of PQC signing algorithms into AWS services to enable the use of post-quantum signatures for session-based authentication such as server and client certificate validation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="workstream-1">Workstream 1</h2>
<p>We view the work here as an ongoing aspect of our migration plan. It has already informed our overall strategy and prioritized our migration based on our customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Similar to our customers, we had to look across all of the places where we use cryptography to determine which implementations needed migration and at which priority. One of the important decisions we made was to focus more on encryption in transit and less on encryption at rest. Public key (asymmetric) cryptography is the foundation of encryption in transit because it enables two parties to negotiate a shared secret across an untrusted network—it’s today’s traditional public key algorithms that are at risk of being compromised by a cryptographically relevant quantum computer. Based on the current consensus across the industry, the risk of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer to the 256-bit symmetric key cryptography isn’t something that needs to be mitigated. Because data at rest in AWS is encrypted using 256-bit symmetric cryptography, we believe that we don’t need to re-encrypt existing customer data or change the symmetric algorithms and keys that we use to encrypt future data.</p>
<p>While the security of symmetric encryption keys and algorithms isn’t impacted by a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, there are cases where public key algorithms are used to negotiate a shared symmetric key, thereby creating risk that the symmetric key could be compromised. The first use of public key cryptography in AWS that we will migrate to PQC is exactly this case—where we negotiate a shared symmetric key between our customers and the public endpoints of AWS services. The networks that customers use to communicate with AWS services are often outside the control of either AWS or the customer, and therefore susceptible to a bad actor capturing data now and then brute-force decrypting it in the future using a cryptographically relevant quantum computer. Workstream 2 discusses this plan in more detail.</p>
<p>The next use of public key cryptography in AWS that we will migrate to PQC is where we offer the ability to create a key pair that acts as a long-term root of trust, typically used to apply a digital signature to software, firmware, or documents. These types of key pairs might need to be valid for digital signing years into the future because they can’t easily be updated. Think of the firmware on satellites, gaming consoles, and other IoT devices where replacing the public key pairs and the signing algorithm code might not be possible over the life of the device. Workstream 3 describes this plan in more detail.</p>
<p>The final area of public key cryptography in AWS that we will migrate to PQC is where we offer the ability to create a key pair that acts as a shorter-term root of trust, typically used to apply a digital signature to a single transaction, a web session, or some other ephemeral message. The most common example of this use case is the way that digital certificates are used to authenticate the server or client in a TLS session. You might assume that workstreams 2 and 3 handle the risks to session key negotiation and digital signatures in a TLS session, so what’s left to protect? It turns out that the way that public key cryptography is used to mutually authenticate two parties using digital certificates to exchange a message is heavily dependent on standards and interoperability across a large set of internet infrastructure. Getting the industry to agree on those standards and testing interoperability will take time before this workstream is finished. Workstream 4 describes this plan in more detail.</p>
<p>We’ve talked about how AWS has done its cryptographic inventory and our plan to migrate to PQC. If you don’t delegate all your cryptographic operations to AWS, what should you be doing to prepare? While no single approach will be right for all applications and industries, here are some resources with more context on recommendations that we contributed to or used as part of our work:</p>
<ul>
<li>CISA Quantum-Readiness: Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography</li>
<li>CISA Strategy for Migrating to Automated Post-Quantum Cryptography Discovery and Inventory Tools</li>
<li>ETSI TR 103 619 Migration strategies and recommendations to Quantum Safe schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>While doing an inventory of cryptography across your organization to prioritize PQC migration might be a multi-year effort for you, we have a couple of tactical recommendations to consider in the short-term. First, work to make sure that you have agility in your abilities to distribute updated versions of software. This is a critical capability for any organization in the context of vulnerability management and software lifecycle maintenance. This ability will be required to adopt new PQ versions of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDKs when we publish them. You might also need to update third-party software components that use TLS or other cryptographic implementations used to communicate with AWS services to make sure that you can take advantage of the PQC we offer.</p>
<p>Second, we strongly encourage you to begin a comprehensive program to adopt TLS 1.3 across your entire organization. This and later versions of TLS not only offer security and performance improvements using classical public key cryptography, but they are strictly mandated to be able to use PQC at all. Even if you recently updated to TLS 1.2 in your clients and servers, you still have work to do to prepare your systems for a PQC future.</p>
<h2 id="workstream-2">Workstream 2</h2>
<p>Customers communicate with cloud services using protocols based on public key cryptography. These protocols (such as TLS) help ensure that customers’ communications are confidential and cannot be altered in transit. To protect our customers’ long-term need for confidentiality, we pioneered a mechanism known as hybrid post-quantum key agreement. Hybrid post-quantum key agreement combines Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), a classic key exchange algorithm, with a post-quantum key encapsulation method, such as the newly standardized ML-KEM algorithm. The resulting two keys are combined to establish session communication keys that encrypt the network traffic. An adversary would need to break both of these public-key primitives (ECDH and ML-KEM) to break the confidentiality property provided by the hybrid key agreement.</p>
<p>AWS has taken the first step in deploying PQC by implementing ML-KEM within AWS-LC, our open-source FIPS-140-3-validated cryptographic library. AWS-LC is the core cryptographic library used throughout AWS. Relevant to this workstream, it’s used in s2n-tls, our open-source TLS implementation used across AWS services with HTTPS-based endpoints.</p>
<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is currently finalizing the TLS protocol standard incorporating post-quantum cryptography. Upon completion of this standard, AWS will update s2n-tls to align with these new specifications. After we have the ML-KEM implementation from AWS-LC integrated with a version of s2n based on IETF standards, we will begin deployment of this s2n version across all AWS public endpoints that offer HTTPS-based interfaces. This represents most AWS services, typically accessed through the AWS SDK or AWS CLI. AWS services that offer public endpoints with other interfaces such as SFTP, IPsec, or SSH will get ML-KEM support as standards bodies such as the IETF publish implementation guidance for those protocols.</p>
<p>As a part of migrating AWS managed service endpoints to PQC over TLS, we’ll also be enabling services that provide server-side TLS termination for your workloads, including Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon CloudFront. This will allow you to use the same digital certificates that you’ve been using with these services and let them negotiate the server-side TLS session using ML-KEM on your behalf. This will provide the long-term confidentiality of your TLS sessions without you having to upgrade the underlying certificates themselves to some as-yet-undefined PQC standard.</p>
<p>To further strengthen this transition to ML-KEM, AWS is collaborating with key industry initiatives, including the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography, the Linux Foundation’s Post Quantum Cryptography Alliance, and the Rust TLS Project. These partnerships are crucial in helping to ensure seamless interoperability between different implementations of PQC solutions across the technology landscape.</p>
<h2 id="workstream-3">Workstream 3</h2>
<p>Many of our customers manufacture systems with firmware, operating systems, and pre-installed third-party applications. These components are cryptographically signed using a public-key-based root of trust to maintain the security and authenticity of systems as they deliver services to end users. Some of these systems, such as smart TVs connected to set-top boxes, might operate without internet connectivity for a decade or longer until they’re installed.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain customers must embed long-lived roots of trust directly into their hardware during manufacturing—a process that cannot be reversed or updated. For devices designed to operate for 10+ years, the security of these initial roots of trust must remain robust even when cryptographically relevant quantum computers become available.</p>
<p>To address this need for long-lived roots of trust for code and document signing, AWS will adopt ML-DSA, a new digital signature algorithm that is believed to be secure against adversaries in possession of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer. We will first offer ML-DSA as a feature within AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), enabling customers to generate and use PQC keys as roots of trust for signing operations within the FIPS-140-3 Level 3 validated hardware security modules (HSMs) used in AWS KMS. This integration represents a crucial milestone in our PQC roadmap, providing customers with the capability to establish secure, quantum-resistant roots of trust and authentication for their long-term security needs.</p>
<p>This long-term perspective underscores the importance of implementing PQC early, helping to ensure that systems will remain secure throughout their entire operational lifetime, even if they are disconnected for a prolonged period. While Amazon will use this capability from AWS KMS to protect our own roots of trust, we encourage you to consider ways in which this capability might help you do the same.</p>
<h2 id="workstream-4">Workstream 4</h2>
<p>In workstream 2 we discussed how PQC can be deployed to protect against risks to the confidentiality of data shared across a communication channel. To complete the story, there still needs to be a way to protect the authenticity of server and client identities over a communication channel in a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Digital signatures are used today for end-entity authentication in networking protocols such as TLS and SSH. Customers use certificates from a trusted certificate authority (CA) that binds a public key to an identity using a digital signature to authenticate service and client endpoints. While some of the PQC standards available today (e.g. ML-DSA) could be implemented with certificates to address the post-quantum risk, the work cannot begin without further standardization and interoperability testing between certificate authorities and the systems that use digital certificates. The primary reason for this delay has to do with how publicly trusted certificates are validated today by recipients of a signed message. In the TLS protocol, for example, the client connecting to a server that presents a chain of digital certificates would need to validate all PQC signatures embedded in each certificate to determine if the server is authentic. The format of those signatures and the processes by which the certificates are issued and managed is governed by the Certificate Authority (CA) Browser Forum. The internet browser manufacturers and certificate issuer members of the CA Browser Forum need to determine how PQC will work for certificate issuance and validation before anyone can safely use them for publicly trusted certificates in TLS sessions. Amazon Trust Services is a certificate issuer and member of the CA Browser Forum; we are engaged to help drive these standards to expedite interoperability testing.</p>
<p>While the PQC story is being finalized for publicly trusted certificates, the AWS Private CA service isn’t necessarily blocked for the same reasons from issuing privately trusted certificates using PQC algorithms like ML-DSA. We would be able to do this because privately trusted certificates aren’t strictly beholden to the rules published by the CA Browser Forum. Customers using privately trusted certificates have the freedom to implement both the client and server portions of a PQC authentication scheme when they control the software on both ends. When workstream 3 is finished and ML-DSA is available for use from AWS KMS for signing operations, AWS Private CA will consider offering PQC as a part of certificate issuance for those customers who are ready to adopt it for their private networking channels. Our open-source AWS-LC and s2n solutions will be available for our customers to implement the PQC certificate validation functions on their clients and servers if need be.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we covered how AWS will migrate to PQC as part of our shared responsibility model. We also provided guidance to you on how to start your PQC migration strategy, and what part of that strategy you can expect AWS to provide. The road ahead will present new challenges and new opportunities as the industry performs the migration to new cryptographic algorithms.
