Uncoder AI also provides unlimited code autocompletion and templates—with no AI here, yet powered by the largest dictionary of detection rules in the world, which can be enriched with your own custom chapters. Stay flexible with on-the-fly rule customization for your SIEM data schema and streamline workflows with Roota and Sigma rule templates.</p>
<h3 id="simplify-your-migration-make-your-detection-code-portable-to-any-chosen-siem--edr-language">Simplify Your Migration: Make Your Detection Code Portable to Any Chosen SIEM &amp; EDR Language</h3>
<p>The latest Uncoder AI upgrade unlocks more advanced capabilities for cross-platform detection rule translation, giving security teams the freedom to migrate, learn, and adapt to new technologies effortlessly. Even for queries with complex logic and multiple functions, Uncoder AI intelligently analyzes and translates unsupported functions using AI-powered enhancements. Need clarity on a function? Uncoder AI provides inline and modal syntax hints, helping detection engineers to understand every bit of detection logic at a glance, discover, and learn new things specializing in multiple languages. What took weeks of expensive offline training bootcamps before, is now possible remotely, at your own pace, with the convenience of an interactive web experience, tapping into the collective knowledge, open frameworks, open-code bases, and optional LLM suggestions.</p>

</p>
<p>As of release, the following 11 languages are supported for cross-platform translation, addressing the need for detection engineers to work with market-leading SIEM, EDR, and Data Lake technologies, as well as generic rule formats such as Sigma &amp; Roota:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splunk</li>
<li>Microsoft Sentinel</li>
<li>Google SecOps</li>
<li>AWS Security Lake (Athena)</li>
<li>IBM QRadar</li>
<li>CrowdStrike Endpoint Security</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</li>
<li>Falcon LogScale (ex-Humio SIEM)</li>
<li>AWS OpenSearch</li>
<li>Elastic Stack</li>
<li>FortiSIEM</li>
</ul>
<p>While the SOC Prime team is working on adding more languages to the full compatibility list, you can begin to future-proof your detection rules and your career opportunities during the migration process already today with the power of Sigma. Per SOC Prime’s analytics, over 11,000 organizations worldwide have used, and are using Sigma rules as the main detection language. Uncoder AI takes a Sigma-first approach, where each specific language is always translated into all supported features of the Sigma language, thus extracting the core value of detection logic. This helps to ensure your rules remain platform-agnostic and migration-ready—preserving your detection logic across any security stack. LLM kicks in optionally for functions that are not, yet, supported by Sigma rules. By nature, those functions are not sensitive, so the risk of sharing them with public AI services while decoupled from detection logic is minimal. For more sensitive environments, SOC Prime is working on the “Bring Your Own LLM” architecture, which will be available shortly.</p>
<p>There are also more conversion perks. Uncoder AI enables turning OSINT threat intelligence into actionable queries in seconds. It auto-parses threat reports and IOC files, instantly generating custom queries for your SIEM or EDR—ready to run with zero manual effort.

<p>AI in cybersecurity is powerful—but only when used with control and precision. While Agentic AI application is certainly on the rise and has its uses, at SOC Prime, we have a different philosophy: cybersecurity is more critical than ever, and we need defenders to have more control, transparency, predictability, and privacy. Agentic AI by its definition can not adhere to these principles, and makes it sound like a shortcut. And we are not taking shortcuts in threat-informed detection engineering. Uncoder AI takes a privacy-first approach, offering cutting-edge open-source and private LLMs as optional opt-in plugins—completely under your control.</p>
<p>With Uncoder AI, every byte sent to an LLM is first verified by the user. You decide what to send, when to send it, and whether to enable AI functionality at all. Out of the box we ship Uncoder AI with models like LLama 8B for personal and 70B for enterprise and MDR use, available since launch and customized for threat-informed detection engineering purposes directly on SOC Prime’s private cloud dedicated servers, ensuring security without compromising efficiency.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on fully autonomous AI responses, Uncoder AI augments human expertise—boosting precision, speed, and decision-making while keeping you in control. AI provides deeper insights and broader visibility, while human intelligence ensures contextual accuracy. This balance creates a cybersecurity co-pilot that empowers, rather than replaces, the analyst—to deliver smarter, more efficient threat detection and response.</p>
