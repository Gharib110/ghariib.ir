<p>We may have found the killer app for AI. Well, actually, British telecom provider O2 has. As The Guardian reports, they have an AI chatbot that acts like a 78-year-old grandmother and receives phone calls. Of course, since the grandmother—Daisy, by name—doesn’t get any real phone calls, anyone calling that number is probably a scammer. Daisy’s specialty? Keeping them tied up on the phone.</p>
<p>While this might just seem like a prank for revenge, it is actually more than that. Scamming people is a numbers game. Most people won’t bite. So, to be successful, scammers have to make lots of calls. Daisy can keep one tied up for around 40 minutes or more.</p>
<p>You can see some of Daisy’s antics in the video below. Or listen to Daisy do her thing in the second video. When a bogus tech support agent tried to direct Daisy to the Play Store, she replied, “Did you say pastry?” Some of them became quite flustered. She even has her own homepage.</p>
<p>While we have mixed feelings about some AI applications, this is one we think everyone can get onboard with. Well, everyone but the scammers.</p>
<p>It might not do voice, but you can play with local AI models easily now. Spoofing scammers is the perfect job for the worst summer intern ever.</p>
