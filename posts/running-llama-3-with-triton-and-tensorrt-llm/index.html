			<div>
				<p>In the training phase, a machine learning (ML) model recognizes patterns in the training data and stores these patterns as numerical values called weights (model parameters). These parameters are used to predict an answer when the model is given new input data or a question.</p>
<p>For example, when you ask a question to ChatGPT or any other Large Language Model (LLM), it generates the answer for you. Other ML models are used to detect fraud transactions, image or even audio classification, and so on. These are examples of inference, where the ML model generates or predicts the answer based on the training data. For the inference to run, we need inference servers!</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will briefly examine inference and inference servers, take a look at a popular inference server Triton, and then deploy the Meta’s Llama 3 model (an LLM) using it.</p>
<h2 id="need-for-inference-servers">Need for inference servers</h2>
<p>Training involves the effort of using ML algorithms to build a model and then fine-tuning it for a specific task using a dataset. While this may be seen as a one-time process, it often requires an iterative process to improve the model performance, resulting in new versions. In contrast, inference is the ongoing process where the model is presented with different inputs to interpret and predict the output. Typically, a model spends more time in inference compared to training.</p>
<p>Running the models at scale for inference, where they are queried by various users and services, has some unique challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Given the huge size of models, especially LLMs, the response times can be longer. Having low latency is critical if you are developing a chat application. On the other hand, some batch workloads running asynchronously can tolerate more latency.</li>
<li><strong>Resource utilization</strong>: ML models are often resource-intensive, requiring more CPUs and costly hardware accelerators like GPUs. So it becomes important to ensure that the available hardware resources are fully utilized, reducing per-inference costs. This can be done by running multiple models in parallel and batching multiple requests together.</li>
<li><strong>Support for different models</strong>: Complex applications utilize pipelines of different models working together to achieve the desired outcome. Also, different teams might use different models and frameworks. This can become tricky for the infrastructure team to manage and optimize for each framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s where inference servers come into the picture. Inference servers load ML models into GPU memory and provide various approaches to running them efficiently at scale. These include running multiple instances of the models in parallel, batching and scheduling the requests, and so on. These servers provide interfaces like HTTP, gRPC, and client libraries to communicate with the deployed models. And also provide standard observability metrics like queue size, latency, CPU/GPU utilization, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, these inference servers support multiple framework backends like TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and more. These backends implement hardware and software-based performance optimizations for models, which help reduce latency and play a big role in inference servers. To learn more about inference, check out our blog post on AI model inference.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-for-running-triton-with-tensorrt-llm">Workflow for running Triton with TensorRT-LLM</h2>
<p>We will be deploying Meta’s Llama 3 8B using the Triton Inference server with TensorRT-LLM backend. The workflow of doing this involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the weights downloaded from Hugging Face Hub to TensorRT-LLM checkpoints.</li>
<li>Compile the checkpoints into a TensorRT engine.</li>
<li>Load the engine into the TensorRT-LLM model runner and run it locally or via the TensorRT-LLM backend for Triton Inference server.</li>
</ol>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>(TensorRT-LLM documentation)</p>
<p>We will cover each step in detail as we perform them. You can read more in TensorRT-LLM Architecture.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before we get started, here are the prerequisites to follow along with this tutorial.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A machine or virtual machine with at least 8 CPUs and a GPU with 24GB of RAM. <em>To find resource requirements for a model, see Can You Run It? LLM version.</em><br>
We are using a g6.2xlarge instance on AWS having 8 vCPUs and L4 Tensor Core GPU with 24GB of memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around 300GB of disk space to store the model weights and all the container images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NVIDIA container runtime installed, as we will be running tools within Docker containers.<br>
We are using the Deep Learning Base AMI with Ubuntu 22.04, which has NVIDIA container runtime and other required tools installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Llama 3 is distributed under a community license agreement, so you will need to request access on Hugging Face and provide a token while cloning the model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="get-the-model-weights">Get the model weights</h2>
<p>We will download the instruction-tuned variant of Llama 3 with 8 billion parameters from Hugging Face Hub. Hugging Face hosts the model weights as Git repositories, with large files stored using Git LFS.</p>
<p>Run the following commands to set up Git LFS for your user, and then clone the model.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get -y install git-lfs
git lfs install

git clone https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
</code></pre><p>Once the <code>git clone</code> command completes, the directory should look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ du -sh Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
60G 	Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct

$ du -sh Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/*
30G 	.git
4.0K	config.json
4.0K	generation_config.json
4.7G	model-00001-of-00004.safetensors
4.7G	model-00002-of-00004.safetensors
4.6G	model-00003-of-00004.safetensors
1.1G	model-00004-of-00004.safetensors
24K 	model.safetensors.index.json
15G 	original
4.0K	special_tokens_map.json
8.7M	tokenizer.json
52K 	tokenizer_config.json
# …
</code></pre><p>Usually, these model repositories contain the model weights, tokenizer files, and a config.json.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model weight tensors (multidimensional arrays) are stored in formats like Safetensors.</li>
<li>Tokenizer and its related configuration files are used to segment the natural language inputs into tokens, which are numerical representations that models can work with.</li>
<li><code>config.json</code> contains details about the pre-trained model like its architecture, size of the model, vocabulary size (tokens), layers, and other hyperparameters required to load the model weights correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have the model weights downloaded, we need to convert them to the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint format.</p>
<h2 id="using-tensorrt-llm">Using TensorRT-LLM</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>TensorRT-LLM is an easy-to-use Python API to define Large Language Models (LLMs) and build TensorRT engines that contain state-of-the-art optimizations to perform inference efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs. TensorRT-LLM contains components to create Python and C++ runtimes that execute those TensorRT engines. It also includes a backend for integration with the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.</p></blockquote>
<p>The optimization techniques for LLMs are rapidly evolving, so it becomes hard to select appropriate ones for a model. The library and helper scripts provided by TensorRT-LLM help in optimizing the LLMs with the right techniques so that they run efficiently despite being large in size. Some examples of these techniques are quantization, kernel fusion, runtime optimizations like KV caching, continuous in-flight batching, etc. Read more about TensorRT-LLM in the documentation.</p>
<p>TensorRT-LLM has built-in support to optimize various well-known models. We will be using the Llama support to optimize the downloaded Llama 3 model. You can find more details about the Llama support in the examples/llama directory on GitHub. It has a bunch of example commands for optimizing and running Llama models.</p>
<p>In order to build a TensorRT engine that will be run by the C++ runtime, we first need to convert the model weights into TensorRT-LLM checkpoints. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the model-specific <code>convert_checkpoint.py</code> file, which has support for some quantization techniques.</li>
<li>Use <code>quantize.py</code> which uses the quantization toolkit Modelopt (previously known as AMMO) to quantize the model. The generated checkpoints are supported by TensorRT-LLM.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will be using the quantization approach to get TensorRT-LLM checkpoints. To learn more about quantization, check out the Quantization section of the AI Model Inference post.</p>
<h3 id="setup-tensorrt-llm">Setup TensorRT-LLM</h3>
<p>We will clone the TensorRT-LLM repository first:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git clone -b v0.9.0 https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM.git
</code></pre><p>Now, set up a Docker container with all the dependencies. Using the container simplifies the environment configuration, it comes preinstalled with base tools.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Ref: https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html

# Obtain and start the basic docker image environment. (Modified according to requirements of quantize.py)

# Install the stable version of TensorRT-LLM (corresponding to the cloned branch).
pip3 install tensorrt_llm==0.9.0 -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
</code></pre><p>Next, we will install the requirements of quantize.py.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Ref: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/v0.9.0/examples/quantization

# Install Modelopt (AMMO)

# Install the additional requirements
cd TensorRT-LLM/examples/quantization
# Cython is required by a transitive dependency
pip install Cython
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre><p>With all the prerequisites out of the way, let’s quantize our model. <em>This is also called post-training quantization (PTQ), as it is done on pre-trained model weights.</em></p>
<h3 id="quantize-the-model">Quantize the model</h3>
<p>We will use quantize.py to apply AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization (paper) on our model. This technique preserves a small percentage of the weights crucial for the LLM’s accuracy. This will reduce the memory footprint of Llama 3 8B significantly.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python3 quantize.py --model_dir /data/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct 
  --output_dir /data/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-awq 
  --dtype bfloat16 
  --qformat int4_awq 
  --awq_block_size 128 
  --batch_size 12
</code></pre><p>Here is a summary of command line flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dtype</code> is the data type used to store the model weights i.e. <code>bfloat16</code>. You can find this in config.json as <code>torch_dtype</code>.</li>
<li><code>qformat</code> is the quantization format INT4 AWQ in our case.</li>
<li><code>awq_block_size</code> is the group size used during AWQ. The quantization happens in groups, and important weights in each group are preserved. 128 is usually recommended.</li>
<li><code>batch_size</code> determines how many batches are processed in parallel. Bigger the number, more memory utilization and faster processing. If you get <code>torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.</code> error while running the command, try to reduce this number.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output in the <code>Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-awq</code> will be a config.json and .safetensors files having the quantized weights of our model. <em>The command took about 5 minutes to complete on our machine, and the resulting directory is about 5.5GiB in size.</em></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># du -h Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-awq/*

</code></pre><h3 id="build-the-tensorrt-engine">Build the TensorRT engine</h3>
<p>Now we will compile the checkpoints into a TensorRT engine that will be specifically optimized for the GPU(s) on our machine.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>trtllm-build 
  --checkpoint_dir /data/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-awq 
  --gpt_attention_plugin bfloat16 
  --gemm_plugin bfloat16 
  --output_dir /data/llama3-engine
</code></pre><p>Quoting the TensorRT-LLM documentation sections Compile the Model into a TensorRT Engine and TensorRT Compiler; emphasis and links mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you created the model definition with the TensorRT-LLM API [which was done by the developers of TensorRT-LLM while adding support for Llama models], you built a graph of operations from NVIDIA TensorRT primitives that formed the layers of your neural network. These operations map to specific kernels; prewritten programs for the GPU.</p>
<p>The TensorRT compiler can sweep through the graph to choose the best kernel for each operation and available GPU [on the machine]. Crucially, it can also identify patterns in the graph where multiple operations are good candidates for being fused into a single kernel. This reduces the required amount of memory movement and the overhead of launching multiple GPU kernels.</p>
<p>TensorRT also compiles the graph of operations into a single CUDA Graph that can be launched all at one time, further reducing the kernel launch overhead.</p>
<p>The TensorRT compiler is extremely powerful for fusing layers and increasing execution speed, but there are some complex layer fusions — like FlashAttention — that involve interleaving many operations together and which can’t be automatically discovered. For those, you can explicitly replace parts of the graph with plugins at compile time [specified as flags to the <code>trtllm-build</code> command].</p></blockquote>
<p>We have enabled the <code>gpt_attention</code> plugin, which enables a FlashAttention-like fused attention kernel. GEMM (General Matrix Multiplications) plugin is also enabled, which uses NVIDIA cuBLASLt to perform GEMM operations, resulting in better performance and reduced GPU memory usage.</p>
<p>In the console log, you can see that many plugins are automatically enabled for our Llama model, which is supported out of the box.</p>

<h3 id="running-the-model-locally">Running the model locally</h3>
<p>Though the engine file has everything we need to execute the model, running LLMs require multiple passes through the model. TensorRT-LLM includes a C++ runtime for executing the model engines; it takes care of KV cache, batching the requests together, and more.</p>
<p>To test the model locally, run the following command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python3 ../run.py

So, counting to nine in Hindi is easy. Just remember the numbers and you&#39;re good to go!&#34;
</code></pre><p>You can exit the container now. After testing the model locally, we will deploy it using Triton to make it available to multiple users over HTTP, gRPC, etc. We will use the TensorRT-LLM backend for Triton, which uses the same C++ runtime.</p>
<h2 id="triton-inference-server">Triton Inference Server</h2>
<p>Triton Inference server can be used for the production deployment of models. Triton supports various deep learning and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT, Python, and more. It can manage model repositories along with their versions, run the models concurrently, do dynamic batching, scheduling, etc. It allows you to create complex pipelines involving multiple models. Triton exposes metrics like GPU utilization, throughput, latency, and so on. All these features make the model deployments production-ready.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-model-repository">Create a model repository</h3>
<p>We will create a model repository with the help of the tensorrtllm_backend Git repository from the Triton project. The model repository holds all the model files, as well as any other metadata needed to load them.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git clone -b v0.9.0 https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend.git

cp llama3-engine/* repo/llama3/tensorrt_llm/1/

# Remove BLS model (unused)
rm -r repo/llama3/tensorrt_llm_bls 
</code></pre><p>In the <code>repo/llama3</code> directory, we have four subdirectories i.e. models:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>preprocessing</code> and <code>postprocessing</code> models use the Python backend. These use the tokenizer files from the Llama 3 model to convert the input strings to token IDs, and then output token IDs from the model to strings.</li>
<li><code>tensorrt_llm</code> is the wrapper on the engine, it is used for inference.</li>
<li><code>ensemble</code> is used to chain the <code>preprocessing</code>, <code>tensorrt_llm</code>, and <code>postprocessing</code> models together. This is the model we will send our prompt to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each model in our repository has a configuration file <code>config.pbtx</code> that holds various parameters for that model. As these are template configuration files, we need to replace some parameters with the correct values. For example, the path to engine and tokenizer files, memory allocation for KV cache, in-flight batching configuration, and so on.</p>

<p>TensorRT-LLM has support for a specific version of TensorRT. An engine built for one version of TensorRT is not compatible with older versions. Also, each version of Triton has support for a specific version of TensorRT-LLM.</p>
<p>To avoid any compatibility issues with these three tools, it is recommended to build the engine using the Triton image which will be used in the final deployment. The <code>tritonserver:yy.mm-trtllm-python-py3</code> images have the supported version of TensorRT-LLM and TensorRT preinstalled. You can find the TensorRT-LLM version in the release notes of Triton under the “Triton TRT-LLM Container Support Matrix” section, and use the scripts from the corresponding version tag on the TensorRT-LLM repository. <em>We have used a separate image to build the engine so that we can show the steps of installation and setup.</em></p>
<h3 id="send-request-to-server">Send request to server</h3>
<p>Let’s send an inference request to the generate endpoint of the server running on HTTP port 8000:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Ref: https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend/tree/v0.9.0/#query-the-server-with-the-triton-generate-endpoint

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v2/models/ensemble/generate -d 
  &#39;{&#34;text_input&#34;: &#34;What is machine learning?&#34;, &#34;max_tokens&#34;: 20, &#34;bad_words&#34;: &#34;&#34;, &#34;stop_words&#34;: &#34;&#34;}&#39;
</code></pre><p>Notice that we have passed 4 input parameters, which are defined in the ensemble model’s <code>config.pbtx</code>. The output would look as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
  &#34;text_output&#34;: &#34; Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn from data and&#34;,
  &#34;context_logits&#34;: 0.0,
  &#34;cum_log_probs&#34;: 0.0,
  &#34;generation_logits&#34;: 0.0,
  &#34;model_name&#34;: &#34;ensemble&#34;,
  &#34;model_version&#34;: &#34;1&#34;,
  &#34;output_log_probs&#34;: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  &#34;sequence_end&#34;: false,
  &#34;sequence_id&#34;: 0,
  &#34;sequence_start&#34;: false
}
</code></pre><p>You can get a detailed overview of using the <code>generate</code> endpoint in the TensorRT-LLM backend repository. Similarly, there are client libraries that can be used to talk to the Triton server, you can read more about them at Triton Client Libraries and Examples.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With LLMs and other machine learning models becoming an integral part of applications, it’s crucial to be able to run the inference within our own infrastructure.</p>
<p>The optimization techniques for LLMs are evolving rapidly. TensorRT-LLM helps us choose the correct set of software and hardware optimization techniques specifically for NVIDIA GPUs. Triton, on the other hand, enables us to deploy production-ready inference servers with complex architecture to support our application’s needs. Navigating these evolving technologies and implementing them effectively can be challenging. For production grade setup, feel free to contact our AI &amp; GPU Cloud experts for help.</p>
