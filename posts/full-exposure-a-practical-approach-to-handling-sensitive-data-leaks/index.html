				<p>Treating exposures as full and complete can help you respond more effectively to focus on what truly matters: securing systems, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining the trust of stakeholders.</p>

<p>In the fast-paced world of software development, accidents can happen—even to the best of us. One such unfortunate event is the accidental leakage of sensitive data such as private or internal source code. When this occurs, companies often find themselves in a frantic rush to assess the situation, leading them down the rabbit hole of trying to determine just how exposed their sensitive data really is. However, this quest for degrees of exposure is a futile endeavor. There’s no such thing as “just a little bit exposed.” Instead, it’s better to opt for the more pragmatic approach: treat the exposure as full and complete from the moment it happens.</p>
<h2 id="the-futility-of-chasing-degrees-of-exposure">The futility of chasing degrees of exposure</h2>
<p>Imagine your company’s sensitive data accidentally ends up in the public domain. An employee, for example, mistakenly posted it to a public repository. Panic sets in, and the first instinct is often to try and measure the extent of the exposure. Who accessed it? For how long? Did anyone download it? These questions are perfectly logical, but they’ll lead you down a time-consuming and fruitless path.</p>
<p>The reality is the moment your sensitive data is public, it’s out there for anyone to see. The internet is a vast and anonymous space, and trying to pinpoint the exact degree of exposure can quickly become an exercise in chasing shadows.</p>
<h2 id="treating-exposure-as-inevitable">Treating exposure as inevitable</h2>
<p>Instead of dwelling on the question of “how exposed” you are, we should assume the worst from the outset. Your sensitive data is fully exposed; consider it a given. Embrace this assumption, and you can start taking practical steps to mitigate the potential fallout.</p>
<h2 id="practical-steps-for-moving-forward">Practical steps for moving forward</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rotate exposed secrets</strong>: If your sensitive data contained secrets such as API keys or personal access tokens, assume that these have been compromised. Immediately rotate these secrets to prevent unauthorized access. Some data may need to be removed entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess impact</strong>: Focus on understanding the potential impact of the exposure. What vulnerabilities might arise from the leaked sensitive data? Perform a thorough security assessment to identify and address potential risks based on the premise that the sensitive data was fully exposed to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>: Transparent communication with stakeholders, customers, and the public is essential. Inform them of the situation, the steps you’re taking to mitigate risks, and any potential actions they should take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal considerations</strong>: Consult with legal experts to understand any legal ramifications of the leak. This could include potential intellectual property issues or contractual obligations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-treating-exposure-as-full">The benefits of treating exposure as full</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: By assuming full exposure, you can act swiftly to mitigate risks and minimize potential damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarity</strong>: There’s no ambiguity. You don’t waste time trying to determine the extent of exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Rotating exposed secrets and conducting a thorough security assessment are prudent measures that enhance your overall security posture.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to handling sensitive data leaks, it’s time to shift our default mindset. Instead of asking “how exposed,” we should embrace the assumption of full exposure. By doing so, we can respond more effectively and focus on what truly matters: securing our systems, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders. In the world of cybersecurity, assuming the worst from the outset is a pragmatic approach that benefits developers and organizations alike.</p>
