				<p>I am working on a AI model that have a few files larger than 10MiB of trained model. While pushing those models to huggingface repository I got an error saying the files are too large to upload. Hugging Face has a size limit for single files, and files larger than 10MiB need special handling. This means I need to change the way I upload or store these files.</p>
<p>This article will help you understand why this error happens and how you can fix it. You will learn how to push large files to a Hugging Face repository step by step.</p>

</code></pre><p>The error indicates that youâ€™re trying to push a file larger than 10 MiB to your Hugging Face repository without using Git Large File Storage (LFS). Hugging Face requires files over 10 MiB to be stored using Git LFS.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-push-large-files-using-git-lfs">Steps to Push Large Files Using Git LFS</h2>
<p>Here is the step by step instructions to resolve this issue:</p>
<p>**- Install Git LFS:**First, ensure that Git LFS (Large File Storage) is installed on your system. You can install it by running the following command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git lfs install
</code></pre><ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Track Large Files: Identify the files larger than 10 MiB and track them with Git LFS. Run this command to track the specific file type or file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git lfs track &#34;*.model&#34;
</code></pre><p>This will add a reference to .gitattributes, telling Git to use LFS for those files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add and Commit Changes:</p>
<p>Add the changes to your repository, including the <code>.gitattributes</code> file, and commit them. Use the following commands:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git add .gitattributes
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Push to the Repository: Push your changes to the Hugging Face repository. The tracked large files will now be uploaded using Git LFS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git push
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Verify File Upload: Check your Hugging Face repository to confirm that the large files have been successfully uploaded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can easily resolve the issue of uploading files larger than 10 MiB to your Hugging Face repository.</p>
<h2 id="still-getting-same-error">Still Getting Same Error</h2>
<p>If you are still facing the same issue, it may be your repository already contains a large file, you may need to remove it and re-commit using Git LFS:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git rm --cached my_model.safetensors
</code></pre><p>The post Your push was rejected because it contains files larger than 10 MiB appeared first on TecAdmin.</p>
