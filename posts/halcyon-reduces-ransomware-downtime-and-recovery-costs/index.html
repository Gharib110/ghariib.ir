<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 30, 2025</p>
<p>Modern defensive cyber solutions, while impressive, have failed in the face of cheap and easy-to-create – and most importantly lucrative – ransomware, according to Austin, Texas-based Halcyon, an anti-ransomware company.</p>
<p>Halcyon claims to have built the first anti-ransomware engine to tackle this problem. Their team has spent decades building name-brand security products and delivering security consulting to much of the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>Richard Seewald, Founder &amp; Managing Partner at Evolution Equity Partners, and Steve Morgan, Founder of Cybersecurity Ventures, recently discussed Halcyon’s one-of-a-kind solution on the Cybercrime Magazine Podcast.</p>
<p>“Watch out for Halcyon,” says Seewald. “Halcyon is growing tremendously well. They have a great team that is the best in the business led by Jon Miller, their co-founder and CEO.”</p>
<p>Morgan had an opportunity to see Miller present recently at Evolution’s annual investor conference. “There’s very, very few companies doing what Halcyon is doing, who are built around anti-ransomware.”</p>
<p>The need to protect against ransomware, and the market opportunity for it, can not be over-stated. Ransomware will cost its victims around $265 billion (USD) annually by 2031, Cybersecurity Ventures predicts, with a new attack (on a consumer or business) every 2 seconds as ransomware perpetrators progressively refine their malware payloads and related extortion activities.</p>
