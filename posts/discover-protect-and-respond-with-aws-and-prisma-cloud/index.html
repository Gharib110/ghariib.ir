				<h2 id="the-problem--the-complexity-of-cloud-environments">The Problem — The Complexity of Cloud Environments</h2>
<p>The complex landscape of cloud services, particularly in multi-cloud environments, poses significant security challenges for organizations. Unmanaged cloud resources, human error, misconfigurations and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, including those from AI-powered applications, create vulnerabilities that can expose sensitive data and disrupt business operations. Organizations are increasingly turning to cloud providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), to address these challenges and power their digital transformation initiatives. However, the vastness of AWS environments and the ease of spinning up new resources and services can lead to cloud sprawl and ongoing security risks.</p>
<p>Organizations must then implement robust cloud security strategies, including continuous monitoring, automated threat detection and strong access controls, to effectively address these threats. Together, Palo Alto Networks and AWS can help you effectively address these challenges and confidently navigate this complex terrain.</p>
<h2 id="better-together--palo-alto-networks-and-aws">Better Together — Palo Alto Networks and AWS</h2>
<p>By combining the power of advanced cloud security solutions by Palo Alto Networks and the scalable cloud infrastructure by AWS, organizations can confidently navigate the complexities of cloud security. You can leverage the strengths of both companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accelerate Cloud Adoption –</strong> Quickly and securely deploy applications on AWS without compromising security.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance Security Posture –</strong> Proactively identify and mitigate threats to your AWS infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Improve Operational Efficiency –</strong> Streamline security operations and reduce administrative overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Drive Innovation –</strong> Focus on innovation while knowing your AWS environment is protected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The increasing complexity of cloud and hybrid environments calls for a solution that provides security across all assets, data and infrastructures. You can discover the power of this partnership firsthand when you leverage Prisma Cloud, which natively integrates with AWS services.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution--prisma-cloud-for-comprehensive-cloud-data-security">The Solution — Prisma Cloud for Comprehensive Cloud Data Security</h2>
<p>Prisma Cloud offers a unified platform for cloud security that encompasses discovery, exposure management, data security posture management (DSPM) and AI security posture management (AI-SPM). Prisma Cloud deploys to your AWS account in minutes, giving your teams code to cloud visibility into AWS environments. By unifying static and real-time data protection, Prisma Cloud hardens your security posture and helps ensure compliance. With an added layer of dynamic monitoring, you will be able to identify breaches and severe risk incidents as they happen, not after the damage is done.</p>
<p>Through meticulous investigation of previous breach incidents in AWS and other public clouds, Prisma Cloud has developed an industry-leading threat model that is continuously updated as new attack vectors are discovered.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-and-capabilities">Key Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h4 id="cloud-security-posture-management-cspm">Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)</h4>
<p>Prisma Cloud takes a unique approach to cloud security posture management (CSPM), providing top CSPM features within our comprehensive cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP). Its CSPM capabilities detect misconfigurations and threats, helping enhance your security and compliance. When integrated with other modules, Prisma Cloud correlates CSPM findings with vulnerabilities and risks to identify the most significant threats to your cloud environments.</p>
<h4 id="cloud-discovery-exposure-management-cdem">Cloud Discovery Exposure Management (CDEM)</h4>
<p>Prisma Cloud provides automated discovery of your cloud resources, ensuring that rogue assets and unauthorized configurations are identified quickly. By leveraging attack surface management technology from Cortex Xpanse, cloud discovery exposure management (CDEM) creates an outside-looking-in view of your AWS environment. This outside-in perspective offers detailed insights into exposed services, enabling your security teams to identify, assess and mitigate unknown and unmanaged internet exposure risks.</p>
<p>Prisma Cloud&rsquo;s automated discovery capabilities ensure that all cloud resources, even those that may have been inadvertently deployed, are identified and monitored. Prisma Cloud helps prevent data exposure and mitigate potential risks by continuously assessing your network and application security.</p>
<h4 id="vulnerability-management">Vulnerability Management</h4>
<p>Once assets are discovered, the next step is to manage and mitigate any vulnerabilities. The rapidly evolving threat landscape and the increasing complexity of cloud environments make vulnerability management a critical challenge. Organizations struggle to manage vulnerabilities for the following reasons: gaps in visibility, insufficient context regarding all vulnerable assets and a lack of risk prioritization.</p>
<p>Prisma Cloud addresses these challenges by focusing on the most impactful threats. It accelerates remediation by 60% by eliminating blind spots, prioritizing vulnerabilities with relevant context, and managing remediation across the entire AWS stack (i.e., virtual machines, containers, Kubernetes, serverless applications and open-source software). Prisma Cloud empowers your security teams to defend against threats, minimize potential damage and proactively protect your cloud environments.</p>
<h2 id="dspm-and-ai-spm">DSPM and AI-SPM</h2>
<p>Prisma Cloud DSPM capabilities give you the necessary tools to protect sensitive information, wherever it lives. Automated data discovery, classification and labeling enables your organization to maintain a full, up to date inventory, ensuring nothing gets overlooked. Prisma Cloud also extends its DSPM capabilities to data detection and response (DDR). DDR lets you address threats in real time and alert your security teams to take steps to contain attacks and prevent further data loss.</p>
<p>Complementing DSPM is AI-SPM, a comprehensive approach for ensuring the security and integrity of AI and machine learning (ML) systems. By adopting AI-SPM, organizations can proactively safeguard their AI systems from threats, reduce data exposure and uphold the trustworthiness of their AI applications.</p>
<p>For organizations working with the Amazon Bedrock environment, Prisma Cloud offers comprehensive visibility, monitoring provisioned throughput and the Bedrock agent to identify data used in model training and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. It highlights any sensitive data involved and ensures that models are securely configured, preventing unauthorized public exposure. This proactive approach helps organizations maintain data privacy and secure AI deployments in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="empower-your-cloud-journey-with-prisma-cloud">Empower Your Cloud Journey with Prisma Cloud</h2>
<p>The future of cloud security is evolving rapidly. As new threats emerge and technology advances, it&rsquo;s crucial to stay ahead of the curve. Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud is specifically designed to adapt to these changes, offering continuous protection for your AWS environment. By utilizing this robust solution, you can safeguard your organization’s future and ensure the security of your valuable data.</p>
