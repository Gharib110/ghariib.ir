				<p>Learn about the latest technologies and innovations for cloud, container, and data security revealed at AWS re:Invent 2024.</p>
<p>Last week marked another action-packed year at AWS re:Invent for the SentinelOne Team. Year after year, a consistent highlight from the event is the strong sense of community it builds with people from different backgrounds, geographies, and business types – all unified by their interest in innovating and doing business on AWS.</p>
<p>This year, the weeklong event brought over 65,000 attendees together to learn, connect, and collaborate over today’s most pressing topics and stories. For those who couldn’t join us in Las Vegas for the event, this blog captures an overview of the highlights, announcements, and activities from the SentinelOne team at this year’s AWS re:Invent.</p>

<h2 id="ai-powered-security-for-the-cloud">AI-Powered Security for the Cloud</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) were a core part of conversations on innovation and security at re:Invent this year. With AI and ML becoming more accessible to organizations in every vertical, much of the discussion revolves around the best ways to help businesses adopt these AI and ML services and establish both purpose-built and comprehensive infrastructure around these models.</p>
<p>As part of this ongoing journey to integrate the power of AI to customer workflows, SentinelOne was excited to paint AWS re:Invent purple. Our AI analyst, Purple AI, is built on a single platform, console, and data lake, designed specifically to unify and accelerate SecOps teams. Our team spent the week highlighting how to leverage long-term usage of AI from behavioral and static approaches to generative AI using LLMs and natural language processing to accelerate cloud security for our customers.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="sentinelones-aws-ai-security-competency">SentinelOne’s AWS AI Security Competency</h2>
<p>SentinelOne is incredibly proud to be part of the AI Security Competency launch at AWS re:Invent. This newly-earned competency in AI Threat Detection and Response is granted to partners who effectively identify and mitigate threats in AI-driven environments. The competency also recognizes AWS Partners who have demonstrated expertise in deploying AI solutions that enhance security measures, ensuring that AI applications operate safely and ethically. By collaborating with partners like SentinelOne, businesses can leverage advanced AI capabilities while maintaining robust security protocols.</p>

<p>To earn this competency, partners completed a robust competency review process, including technical demonstrations and written attestations of their solution capabilities. Customer references and proof points were also collected as part of the stringent review process. SentinelOne is thrilled to have received this competency, and we wish congratulations to all other vendors who achieved their new AI Security competencies at AWS re:Invent!</p>
<h2 id="mortal-vs-machine--now-featuring-amazon-bedrock">Mortal vs. Machine | Now Featuring Amazon Bedrock</h2>
<p>In October, we announced that AWS customers could power Purple AI with Amazon Bedrock, and last week, we brought that to the expo floor in our crowd favorite “Mortal vs. Machine” experience.</p>
<p>
<figure>

</figure>


</p>
<p>In this activity, we put one of our top threat-hunting experts up against a randomly selected volunteer from the expo floor to complete ‘capture-the-flag’ themed threat-hunting tasks. This wasn’t a quiet or low-key challenge though, as we had live feeds of both participants shown on the theatre screen with sound effects, graphics, and a cheering audience.</p>
<p>
<figure>

</figure>


</p>
<p>You’d think this might be an unfair scenario for our volunteers, but the great equalizer is that they had the use of Purple AI while our threat hunting expert had only their knowledge and skillset, representing threat hunters and SOC analysts who aren’t partnered with SentinelOne. Over and over again, the crowd went wild as the volunteer beat the threat hunter and won mini drones and exclusively branded building block kits!</p>
<h2 id="ai-spm--securing-known--shadow-ai-services-in-the-workplace">AI-SPM | Securing Known &amp; Shadow AI Services in the Workplace</h2>
<p>Continuing with the theme of AI, SentinelOne showcased its new AI-SPM (Security Posture Management) solution on the expo hall floor, drawing enthusiastic crowds of attendees eager to see it in action. This new solution, launched just last month, provides AI inventory automation, misconfiguration detection (especially around APIs), and attack path analysis to help organizations secure AI workloads. AI-SPM gives organizations hands customers full visibility into, and protection over, both known and shadow AI cloud services running in their environment – a potentially high-risk factor especially as use of AI services continue to rise.</p>
<p>With the rapid adoption of AI, there are new and evolving security risks and it was great to see the enthusiasm for security solutions like AI-SPM that will help accelerate adoption of AI services confidently and securely.</p>
<h2 id="adopting-an-evidence-based-approach-to-cloud-security">Adopting an Evidence-Based Approach to Cloud Security</h2>
<p>The SentinelOne team connects often with our customers, industry analysts, and experts. This week, we heard from AWS re:Invent attendees that Cloud SOC teams are challenged by the sheer number of alerts and volume of cloud risks – all compounded by the increasing sophistication of attacks being seen in the wild. We also heard that the current approach to cloud security isn’t working for them. Disparate tools, unclear ownership, and the lack of context and prioritization from alerts drives a typically reactive approach to cloud security.</p>
<p>Based on these pain points, it’s not surprising that Chris Hosking, Cloud Security Evangelist at SentinelOne, and Brendan Putek of Relay Network (a SentinelOne customer) spoke to a captivated audience about a different way to approach cloud security. In their talk, “Driving Real Outcomes with an Evidence-Based Approach to Cloud Security”, they discussed the imbalance of the cloud SOC approach, the challenges faced today, and proposed a proactive and evidence-based approach to cloud security, including autonomous detection and response using AI. Brendan shared his experience of implementing this approach, with a focus on developing AND responding left, earlier in the pipeline, to deliver faster with stronger security outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-resource-control-policies-on-aws">Support for Resource Control Policies on AWS</h2>
<p>Although not an official AWS re:Invent announcement, we’re happy to continue our joint innovation with AWS to help customers achieve better security outcomes with support for Resource Control Policies (RCPs) on AWS. Recently AWS rolled out RCPs, a new authorization policy managed in AWS Organizations that can be used to set the maximum available permissions on resources within your entire organization. SentinelOne looks forward to supporting these from day one and help cloud administrators secure access to resources, allowing the use of essential tools like SentinelOne’s Cloud Native Security (CNS) to help centralize identification threats, verified exploit paths, misconfigurations, and policy issues.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Cloud Native Security works by eliminating false positives so that SOC analysts can take faster action on the alerts that matter. The agentless CNAPP solution gives security teams access to an offensive engine with Verified Exploit Paths

, so they can think like an attacker and get ahead of truly exploitable alerts.</p>
<h2 id="celebrating-the-aws-security-community">Celebrating the AWS Security Community</h2>
<p>This year, we added something new to the mix with our inaugural Re-Energize Event, supported by AWS. Re-Energize brought together over 75 female leaders and allies in the cloud security space to connect, re-spark their energy after travel, and to get inspired before the action packed week at the show.</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Attendees heard from our esteemed speaker, Jeannette Bronee, who asked us to consider our core relationships with self, work, and others, and challenged us to think about how we can bring intentionality and care to these relationships to achieve success, however we define it. This was a great way to start the week and we cannot wait to do it again next year.</p>
<p>
