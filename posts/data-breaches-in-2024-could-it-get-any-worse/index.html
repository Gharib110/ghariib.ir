			<h1>Data breaches in 2024: Could it get any worse?</h1>
			<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>

				<p>It may sound weird when I say that I would like to remember 2024 as the year of the biggest breaches. That’s mainly because that would mean we’ll never see another year like it.</p>
<p>To support this nomination, I will remind you of several high-profile breaches, some of a size almost beyond imagination, some that really left us worried because of the type of data that was stolen, and a few duds.</p>
<h2 id="huge-increase-in-numbers">Huge increase in numbers</h2>
<p>As we reported in July, the number of data breach victims went up 1,170% in Q2 2024, compared to Q2 2023 (from 81,958,874 victims to 1,041,312,601).</p>
<p>The huge increase is no big surprise if you look at the size of some of these breaches. Remember these headlines?</p>
<p>5. Dell notifies customers about data breach (49 million customers)</p>
<p>4. “Nearly all” AT&amp;T customers had phone records stolen in new data breach disclosure (73 million people).</p>
<p>3. 100 million US citizens officially impacted by Change Healthcare data breach.</p>
<p>2. Ticketmaster confirms customer data breach (560 million customers).</p>
<p>1. Stolen data from scraping service National Public Data leaked online (somewhere between 2.9 billion people (unconfirmed) and 272 million unique social security numbers).</p>
<p>The reason why I counted down to the biggest one, is because the first 4 are household names and people will know whether they might be affected since they are customers of the company. But National Public Data is a company that most people had never heard of before they read about the data breach.</p>
<p>The data gathered by National Public Data was “scraped,” meaning it was pulled from various sources and then combined in a large database. This also made it hard to get an exact number of affected people. The initially reported 2.9 billion people seemed a stretch, so we looked into that, and the estimates from our researchers say that it contains 272 million unique social security numbers. That could mean that the majority of US citizens were affected, although numerous people confirmed that it also included information about deceased relatives.</p>
<h2 id="sensitive-data">Sensitive data</h2>
<p>Some of the huge breaches we listed contained Social Security Numbers (SSNs) which are a challenging process to be changed, but other breaches revealed all kinds of sensitive information.</p>
<p>Financial information was leaked by MoneyGram. Slim CD, Evolve Bank, Truist Bank, Prudential, and American Express.</p>
<p>Medical information was leaked by the earlier mentioned Change Healthcare breach, but we saw several smaller incidents at providers in the healthcare industry like Australia’s leading medical imaging provider I-MED Radiology, US and UK based healthcare provider DocGo that offers mobile health services, ambulance services, and remote monitoring for patients, nonprofit, outpatient provider of treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) CODAC Behavioral Healthcare, and DNA testing companies.</p>
<p>Ransomware incidents are also a big source of data breaches. When victims refuse to pay, the ransomware groups publish stolen data, as we saw with pharmacy chain Rite Aid.</p>
<p>Other sensitive data might have surfaced in hacktivist breaches at the Heritage Foundation, The Real World, and the Internet Archive. And sometimes it may be hard to not feel a bit of schadenfreude, as in the breach of the userbase of mobile monitoring app mSpy.</p>
<h2 id="anticlimaxes">Anticlimaxes</h2>
<p>In a few cases, there was a lot to do about something that turned out not to be so bad after all.</p>
<p>In February, a cybercriminal offered a business contact information database containing 132.8 million records for sale. It turned out to be a two-year-old third-party database which showed around 122 million unique business email addresses. That would have made it into our top 5, but the information in the database ages rather quickly. As soon as you move to a new job, that email address gets decommissioned and becomes worthless to phishers and other cybercriminals.</p>
<p>In July, a user leaked a file containing 9,948,575,739 unique plaintext passwords. The list was referred to as RockYou2024 because of its filename, rockyou.txt. However, without the associated user names or email, the list would have been of limited use to cybercriminals. If you don’t reuse passwords and never use “simple” passwords, like single words, then this release should not concern you.</p>
<p>If you were in any way affected by a data breach, we encourage you to have a look at our guide: Involved in a data breach? Here’s what you need to know.</p>
