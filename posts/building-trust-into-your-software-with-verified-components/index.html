				<p>Within software development, security and compliance are more than simple boxes to check. Each attestation and compliance check is backed by a well-considered risk assessment that aims to avoid ever-changing vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Software development teams don’t want to worry about vulnerabilities when they are focused on building something remarkable.</p>
<p>In this article, we explain how Docker Hub and Docker Scout can help development teams ensure a more secure and compliant software supply chain. </p>

<h2 id="security-starts-with-trusted-foundations">Security starts with trusted foundations</h2>
<p>Every structure needs a strong foundation. A weak base is where cracks begin to show. Using untrusted or outdated software is like building a skyscraper on sand, and security issues can derail progress, leading to costly fixes and delayed releases. By “shifting security left” — addressing vulnerabilities early in the development process — teams can avoid these setbacks down the road.  </p>
<p>Modern development demands a secure and compliant software supply chain. Unverified software or vulnerabilities buried deep within base images can become costly compliance issues, disrupting development timelines and eroding customer trust. One weak link in the supply chain can snowball into more significant issues, affecting product delivery and customer satisfaction. Without security and compliance checks, organizations will lack the credibility their customers rely on.</p>
<h2 id="how-docker-hub-and-scout-help-teams-shift-left">How Docker Hub and Scout help teams shift left</h2>
<p>Software developers are like a construction crew building a skyscraper. The process requires specialized components — windows, elevators, wiring, concrete, and so on — which are found at a single supply depot and which work in harmony with each other. This idea is similar to microservices, which are pieced together to create modern applications. In this analogy, Docker Hub acts as the supply depot for a customer’s software supply chain, stocked with trusted container images that help developer teams streamline development.</p>
<p>Docker Hub is more than a container registry. It is the most widely trusted content distribution platform built on secure, verified, and dependable container images. Docker Official Images (DOI) and Docker Verified Publisher (DVP) programs provide a rock-solid base to help minimize risks and let development teams focus on creating their projects. </p>
<p>Docker Hub simplifies supply chain security by ensuring developers start with trusted components. Its library of official and verified publisher images offers secure, up-to-date resources vetted for compliance and reliability, eliminating the risk of untrusted or outdated components.</p>
<h3 id="proactive-risk-management-is-critical-to-software-development">Proactive risk management is critical to software development</h3>
<p>To avoid breaking production environments, organizations need to plan ahead by catching and tracking common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) early in the development process. Docker Scout enables proactive risk management by integrating security checks early in the development lifecycle. Scout reduces the likelihood of security incidents and streamlines the development process.</p>
<p>Additionally, Docker Scout Health Scores provide a straightforward framework for evaluating the security posture of container images used daily by development teams. Using an easy-to-understand alphabetical grading system (A to F), these scores assess CVEs in software components within Docker Hub. This feature lets developers quickly evaluate and select trusted content, ensuring a secure software supply chain.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-shadow-changes-with-iam-and-rbac-for-secure-collaboration">Avoid shadow changes with IAM and RBAC for secure collaboration</h3>
<p>Compliance is not glamorous, but it is essential to running a business. Development teams don’t want to have to worry about whether they are meeting industry standards — they want to know they are. Docker Hub makes compliance simple with pre-certified images and many features that take the guesswork out of governance. That means you can stay compliant while your teams keep growing and innovating.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge to scaling a team or growing your development operations is not about adding people — it’s about maintaining control without losing momentum. Tracking, reducing, and managing shadow changes means that your team does not lose the flow state in development velocity. </p>
<p>Docker Hub’s Image Access Management (IAM) enforces precise permissions to ensure that only authorized people have access to modify sensitive information in repositories. Additionally, with role-based access control (RBAC), you’re not just delegating; you’re empowering your team with predefined roles that streamline onboarding, reduce mistakes, and keep everyone moving in harmony.</p>
<p>Docker Hub’s activity logs provide another layer of confidence as they let you track changes, enforce compliance, and build trust. These capabilities enhance security and boost collaboration by creating an environment where team members can focus on delivering high-quality applications.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-trust">Built-in trust</h2>
<p>Without verified components, development teams can end up playing whack-a-mole with vulnerabilities. Time is lost. Money is spent. Trust is damaged. Now, picture a team working with trusted content and images that integrate security measures from the start. They deliver on time, on budget, and with confidence.</p>
<p>Building security into your applications doesn’t slow you down; it’s your superpower. Docker weaves trust and security into every part of your development process. Your applications are safeguarded, your delivery is accelerated, and your team is free to focus on what matters most — creating value.</p>
<p>Start your journey today. With Docker, you’re not just developing applications but building trust. Learn how trusted components help simplify compliance, enhance security, and empower your team to innovate fearlessly. </p>
