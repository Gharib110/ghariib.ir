				<p>The ability to anticipate and mitigate disruptions is more critical than ever. Organizations that lack a structured approach to assessing operational risks may find themselves vulnerable to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.</p>
<p>A <strong>Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</strong> is a cornerstone of business continuity planning, helping organizations identify critical functions, assess vulnerabilities, and allocate resources effectively to maintain operational resilience. This article explores the importance of BIA, its key benefits, and how organizations can leverage it to enhance preparedness against disruptions.</p>
