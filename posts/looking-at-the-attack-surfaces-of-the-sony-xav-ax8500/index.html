				<p>For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest a total of 4 head units have been selected. One of these is the single DIN Sony XAV-AX8500 that offers a variety of functionality such as wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as well as USB media playback and more.</p>
<p>This blog post presents internal photos of the XAV-AX8500 boards and highlights each of the interesting components.</p>
<p><strong>Internals</strong></p>
<p>Accessing the internals of the XAV-AX8500 involves removing a few screws and metal plates. Once the main chassis is open 3 interconnected boards are exposed that are connected via flat flexible cables. The main board is shown below.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: Main board (top)</em></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The main application processor is an NXP i.MX 8M Mini with part number MIMX8MM6CVTKZAA. This is a powerful processor with 4 Cortex-A53 cores as well as a low power Cortex M4 that is used for lighter workloads and also security related functions.</p>
<p>To the left of the processor is the supporting SDRAM and eMMC the i.MX 8M Mini utilizes. The SDRAM is an 8Gb Nanya NT6AN256T32AV-J2 8Gb LPDDR4 chip and below that is a 16GB Samsung KLMAG1JETD eMMC chip.</p>
<p>To the right of the eMMC is the Rohm BD71847A PMIC and further right is an unused socket. There&rsquo;s also HDMI and USB-C inputs towards the bottom right of the board.</p>
<p>Above the unused socket is the Murata LBEE5ZZ1PJ radio module that handles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth operations.</p>
<p>The underside of the main board is shown below.</p>

<p><em>Figure 2: Main board (underside)</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to see other than the Analog Devices ADV7482 video decoder and HDMI receiver chip.</p>
<p>Next to the main board is a smaller board that receives GPS, iData Link and optional remote control input.</p>

<p><em>Figure 3: GPS, iData Link and remote control board (top)</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The GPS module is the Unicorecomm UM220-INS NL which is advertised as a &ldquo;High-end GNSS+MEMS Integrated Navigation and Positioning Module&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Under both of these boards sits a much larger PCB that handles power and various other inputs and outputs such as audio and video. A photo of this board is shown below.</p>

<p><em>Figure 4: Power, audio and video board (top)</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Towards the bottom left is the LC88FC2H0A microcontroller from ON Semiconductor. This uses the obscure 16-bit Xstormy16 architecture and is suggested for use in white goods, home audio and car audio applications. To the left of the microcontroller is an unused 5 pin socket.</p>
<p>The other components are related to power handling and digital signal processing.</p>
<p>For completeness the underside of the board is shown below.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much of interest on this side.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully, this blog post provides enough information to kickstart vulnerability research against the XAV-AX8500. Keep an eye out for future posts that will cover the threat landscape of the XAV-AX8500.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to Automotive Pwn2Own again in Tokyo in January 2025 at Automotive World, and we will see if IVI vendors have improved their product security. Donâ€™t wait until the last minute to ask questions and register! We hope to see you there.</p>
<p>You can find me on Twitter at @ByteInsight, and follow the team on Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn, or Bluesky for the latest in exploit techniques and security patches.</p>
