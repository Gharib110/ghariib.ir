<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 14, 2025</p>
<p>According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Despite the growing sophistication of cyberattacks, human error remains one of the most common vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Phishing scams, malware attacks, and social engineering tactics often target employees unaware of basic cyber security practices. This lack of awareness can result in breaches that cost companies millions.</p>
<p>OK! Magazine reports that the cost of a data breach remains among the highest globally in the U.S., further underscoring the need for robust security measures and employee training. The global shortage of cybersecurity professionals, estimated to be several million, combined with significant issues in the continuous training and skill updating of current specialists, presents a very concerning situation.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity of cybersecurity is the rise of Artificial Intelligence. While AI offers immense innovation potential, it also introduces unique vulnerabilities. Employees unfamiliar with AI’s implications may be susceptible to AI-driven attacks, such as deepfake scams.</p>
<p>Training programs must address both the opportunities and risks associated with AI to ensure employees are prepared for its dual-edged impact.</p>
