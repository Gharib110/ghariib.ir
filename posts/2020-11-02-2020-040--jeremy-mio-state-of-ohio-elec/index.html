<p>“Ohio has taken steps to combat those types of threats. In October, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed into <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/cybersecurity/467485-ohio-governor-signs-into-law-measure-to-increase-cybersecurity-of">law</a> a measure that required post-election audits to ensure the accuracy of the vote count, and created a “civilian cyber security reserve” to defend against potential cyberattacks.</p>

<p><em>“His [secretary of state LaRose] first-of-its-kind Vulnerability Disclosure Policy invites Ohio’s crop of “white-hat” hackers — the good guys, opposite malevolent “black-hat” hackers — to break into the state’s election system, find bugs and report them so officials can ensure they’re fixed by Election Day.</em></p>
<p><em>There are some strings attached: White hats aren’t allowed to phish for information or tamper with electronic county voter registration systems, and actual voting machines — legally barred from being connected to the internet — are off-limits. If they do find sensitive information, they’re expected to report it.”</em></p>
<p>How did the threat model shift from the last time we talked?</p>
<p>What has changed in terms of organization and threats? You mentioned 4-5 different voting regions last time, all with different levels of technology. Any updates on the tech? </p>
<p>How did covid change how voting occurred? </p>
<p>How have you leveraged the Elections Infrastructure ISAC (EI-ISAC) in passing along threats and sharing information?</p>

<p>Has insider threat been part of your threat model and what has your group done to minimize the chances? <strong><em>(why does it feel like the Oscars has more scrutiny in terms of voting security than the US democratic process? &ndash;brbr)</em></strong></p>
<p>What does physical security look like in terms of people going to the polls? <strong><em>(wasn’t sure if that was something in your purview &ndash;brbr)</em></strong> <strong><em>(this is not (Election Board and Sheriff), but can discuss high level -jmio)</em></strong></p>
