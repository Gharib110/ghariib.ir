			<h1>5 Practical Strategies for SMBs to Tackle CIS CSC Control 16</h1>

			<div>
				<p>Today we’re diving into the world of application software security. Specifically, we’re talking about implementing CIS CSC Version 8, Control 16 for small to mid-sized businesses. Now, I know what you’re thinking – “Brent, that sounds like a handful!” But don’t worry, I’ve got your back. Let’s break this down into bite-sized, actionable steps that won’t break the bank or overwhelm your team.</p>
<h2 id="1-build-a-rock-solid-vulnerability-response-process">1. Build a Rock-Solid Vulnerability Response Process</h2>
<p>First things first, folks. You need a game plan for when (not if) vulnerabilities pop up. This doesn’t have to be fancy – start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designate a vulnerability response team (even if it’s just one person to start)</li>
<li>Set up clear reporting channels</li>
<li>Establish a communication plan for affected parties</li>
</ul>
<p>By nailing this down, you’re not just putting out fires – you’re learning where they start. This intel is gold for prioritizing your next moves in the Control 16 implementation.</p>
<h2 id="2-embrace-the-power-of-open-source">2. Embrace the Power of Open Source</h2>
<p>Listen up, because this is where it gets good. You don’t need to shell out big bucks for fancy tools. There’s a treasure trove of open-source solutions out there that can help you secure your code and scan for vulnerabilities. Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk are your new best friends. They’ll help you keep tabs on those sneaky third-party components without breaking a sweat.</p>
<h2 id="3-get-a-grip-on-third-party-code">3. Get a Grip on Third-Party Code</h2>
<p>Speaking of third-party components, let’s talk about managing that external code. I know, I know – it’s tempting to just plug and play. But trust me, a little due diligence goes a long way. Start simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an inventory of your third-party software (yes, a spreadsheet works)</li>
<li>Regularly check for updates and vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Develop a basic process for vetting new components</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you’re only as strong as your weakest link. Don’t let that link be some outdated library you forgot about.</p>
<h2 id="4-bake-security-into-your-development-process">4. Bake Security into Your Development Process</h2>
<p>Here’s where the rubber meets the road, folks. The earlier you bring security into your development lifecycle, the less headache you’ll have down the line. Encourage your devs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use linters for code quality</li>
<li>Implement static application security testing (SAST)</li>
<li>Conduct threat modeling during design phases</li>
</ul>
<p>It might feel like extra work now, but trust me – it’s a lot easier than trying to bolt security onto a finished product.</p>
<h2 id="5-keep-your-team-in-the-know">5. Keep Your Team in the Know</h2>
<p>Last but not least, let’s talk about your most valuable asset – your people. Security isn’t a one-and-done deal; it’s an ongoing process. Keep your team sharp with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular training sessions (they don’t have to be boring!)</li>
<li>Security awareness programs</li>
<li>Informal discussions about recent incidents and lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need a big budget for this. There are tons of free resources out there. Heck, you’re reading one right now!</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>Remember, implementing Control 16 isn’t about perfection – it’s about progress. Start small, learn as you go, and keep improving. Before you know it, you’ll have a robust application security program that punches way above its weight class.</p>
