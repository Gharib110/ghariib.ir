<h4 id="design-and-build-quality">Design and Build Quality</h4>
<p>The DOSS Extreme Boom+ boasts a rugged design that emphasizes durability. Its IPX6 waterproof rating ensures that the speaker can handle splashes and even light rain, making it ideal for use by the pool, at the beach, or during outdoor parties. The speaker is built with a sturdy ABS and mesh material, providing both strength and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>One of the standout features is its portability. Despite its robust build, the speaker is designed to be easily carried, thanks to an integrated handle. Weighing 3.77 kilograms, it strikes a balance between being substantial enough to deliver powerful sound and light enough to transport without much hassle.</p>

</p>
<h4 id="audio-performance">Audio Performance</h4>
<p>At the heart of the DOSS Extreme Boom+ is its impressive audio system. The speaker features dual 40W woofers, dual 10W tweeters, and passive radiators, all working together to produce a total output of 100W. This setup ensures a full-range sound experience with rich, deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs.</p>
<p><strong>Highs</strong>: The treble is crisp and clear, making it ideal for listening to genres requiring high-frequency clarity, such as classical and jazz music.</p>
<p><strong>Mids</strong>: The midrange frequencies are well-defined, ensuring that vocals and instruments are clear and present. This makes the speaker suitable for pop, rock, and other vocal-centric music genres.</p>
<p><strong>Bass</strong>: The bass response is impressive for a speaker of this size. The enhanced bass technology ensures that low-end frequencies are punchy and robust without overpowering the mids and highs, making it perfect for bass-heavy genres like hip-hop and electronic dance music.</p>
<p>The extra bass mode is a notable feature for bass enthusiasts. By pressing and holding the bass mode button, the speaker intensifies the low frequencies, delivering a punchier and more resonant bass experience. This feature is particularly useful for outdoor environments where bass can often get lost.</p>
<h4 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h4>
<p>Battery performance is crucial for outdoor speakers, and the DOSS Extreme Boom+ does not disappoint. It houses a 10400 mAh battery that offers up to 18 hours of playback at 80% volume. This long battery life ensures that the music can keep playing throughout the day and into the night without the need for frequent recharging.</p>
<p>In addition to its impressive playback time, the speaker includes a built-in power bank. This feature allows users to charge their devices on the go, providing an added layer of convenience, especially during extended outdoor activities.</p>
<h4 id="connectivity-and-compatibility">Connectivity and Compatibility</h4>
<p>The DOSS Extreme Boom+ supports Bluetooth connectivity, making it compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. The Bluetooth connection is stable and offers a decent range, ensuring that the music playback remains uninterrupted.</p>
<p>In addition to Bluetooth, the speaker has an auxiliary input, allowing non-Bluetooth devices to connect using a standard 3.5mm audio cable. This is a handy feature for users who wish to connect older devices or those without Bluetooth capability.</p>
<p>The speaker also supports microSD card playback, perfect for those who prefer storing music on a physical medium. Users can simply insert a microSD card loaded with their favorite songs, and the speaker will automatically play the tracks.</p>
<h4 id="lighting-and-additional-features">Lighting and Additional Features</h4>
<p>Adding to its appeal, the DOSS Extreme Boom+ includes dynamic LED lights that sync with the music. These mixed-color lights can create a visually stimulating atmosphere, perfect for parties and gatherings. Users can choose from six different light modes, including breathing, room balance, ripple, roll, crossfade, and off, allowing for customization based on the event or mood.</p>
<p>The PartySync mode is another exciting feature. It enables users to pair multiple DOSS Extreme Boom+ speakers, up to 100 units, for a synchronized and amplified audio experience. This mode is particularly beneficial for larger gatherings where a single speaker might not suffice.</p>
<h4 id="durability-and-water-resistance">Durability and Water Resistance</h4>
<p>Portability often comes with the risk of exposure to the elements, and the DOSS Wireless Portable Speaker is built to withstand such challenges. Its durable fabric and rubberized exterior provide a good level of protection against accidental drops and impacts.</p>
<p>While the speaker is waterproof, it offers water resistance with an IPX6 rating. This means it can handle splashes and rain, making it suitable for outdoor use at the beach, by the pool, or during a picnic.</p>
<h4 id="tws-true-wireless-stereo-mode">TWS (True Wireless Stereo) Mode</h4>

</li>
<li>
<p>Press the TWS button on one speaker to initiate pairing.</p>
</li>

<p>The speakers will connect, providing a true stereo sound experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature is perfect for creating an immersive audio environment, whether indoors or outdoors.</p>
<h4 id="partysync-mode">PartySync Mode</h4>
<p>The PartySync mode allows multiple DOSS speakers to be connected, creating a surround sound experience for larger gatherings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn on all the speakers you want to connect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure they are all in Bluetooth mode.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4 id="use-with-echo-dot">Use with Echo Dot</h4>
