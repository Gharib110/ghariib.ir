<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 5, 2025</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that global cybercrime damages will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. This staggering figure highlights the urgent need for enhanced defenses against ransomware, phishing attacks, and emerging threats like deepfake-based fraud.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are revolutionizing cybersecurity. On the one hand, AI-powered tools enable faster threat detection, real-time incident response, and predictive analytics. Tools like machine learning-driven intrusion detection systems can identify anomalies with unprecedented accuracy, helping organizations mitigate risks before they escalate.</p>
<p>However, cybercriminals are also leveraging AI. Deepfake technology, for instance, is being used to create convincing phishing scams and identity theft. In 2025, experts are predicting a sharp rise in AI-driven attacks, challenging defenders to innovate even faster.</p>
<p>The double-edged sword of AI is one of five cybersecurity predictions for what’s next in cybersecurity this year.</p>
