				<p>Learn about the key macOS malware families from 2024, including tactics, IoCs, opportunities for detection, and links to further reading.</p>
<p>Across 2024, we saw a sharp rise in malware campaigns aimed at macOS users in the enterprise. From infostealers masquerading as business and productivity apps to sophisticated modular backdoors, not to mention plenty of APT activity, threat actors were busier than ever developing and deploying malware to compromise organizations and steal sensitive data.</p>
<p>In this post, we survey the key macOS malware families appearing in 2024. For each, we provide a short synopsis highlighting the tactics, indicators of compromise, and opportunities for detection, along with links to further reading, to help security teams and researchers stay on top of an expanding macOS threat landscape.</p>
<p>For all of these threats, SentinelOne customers are protected by the Singularity platform.</p>

<h2 id="infostealers--amos-atomic-banshee-cuckoo-poseidon--friends">InfoStealers | Amos Atomic, Banshee, Cuckoo, Poseidon &amp; Friends</h2>
<p>There were so many stealers running rampant throughout 2024 that to cover them all individually would require a post of its own. Fortunately, that’s one we’ve already written: From Amos to Poseidon | A SOC Team’s Guide to Detecting macOS Atomic Stealers 2024. Suffice to say that the quantity of these stealers in the wild is unprecedented in the history of macOS security.</p>
<p>Central to the way the Amos family of stealers work is the need to grab, in plain text, the user’s login credentials. Without this, the stealers cannot unlock the Keychain containing other passwords and credentials. In order to do this, they make use of a simple AppleScript command executed through osascript. The wording can vary, but the required element is to run a <code>display dialog</code> command with the <code>hidden answer</code> parameter, such as in the example below and described in detail here.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>display dialog “Please enter your password to proceed.” 
default answer “ ” giving up after 60 with hidden answer&#39;

<p>New variants of these Amos Atomic family stealers have been rolling out throughout 2024, attempting to obfuscate the required AppleScript code in new and inventive ways. These obfuscations can work against security solutions that rely solely on detecting strings statically in the binary; in some cases, the strings are encrypted and in others the <code>osascript</code> is loaded in memory after being retrieved from a remote URL.</p>
<p>Security solutions employing dynamic detection enjoy better success against such techniques since in order to work the malware must itself decode and execute the strings in clear text.</p>

<h2 id="backdoor-activator--trojan-masquerades-in-business-apps">Backdoor Activator | Trojan Masquerades in Business Apps</h2>
<p>First spotted by researchers in January 2024, this malware was part of a campaign infecting users through cracked versions of popular applications. The threat actors choose a wide range of business-focused and productivity applications to crack in order to spread their malware far and wide, potentially for the purpose of creating a macOS botnet or delivering further payloads at scale. SentinelOne’s investigation found several hundred unique Mach-O binaries on VirusTotal infected with macOS.Bkdr.Activator.</p>

<h2 id="lightspy--evolves-from-mobile-to-macos">LightSpy | Evolves from Mobile to macOS</h2>
<p>LightSpy malware has been around in one form or another since at least 2019 but had been thought to be part of a campaign aimed solely against Hong Kong and other Chinese-speaking mobile phone users. In 2024, however, researchers discovered a macOS version of LightSpy, complete with macOS specific plugins for a suite of surveillance and control tasks, with an apparent focus on targets in India.</p>
<p>The malware provides a modular surveillance toolset with the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>File theft: Steals files from applications like Telegram, QQ, WeChat, as well as personal documents and media.</li>
<li>Audio-visual recording: Records audio from the infected device and captures images using the device’s camera</li>
<li>Data harvesting: Collects browser history, WiFi connection lists, installed application details.</li>
<li>System access: Retrieves user Keychain data, device lists</li>
<li>Code execution: executes shell commands, potentially allowing full device control.</li>
</ul>
<p>LightSpy employs advanced techniques like certificate pinning to prevent detection and interception of communication with its command-and-control server. Code artifacts suggest that the developers are native Chinese speakers, and industry attribution points the finger at APT41 (<em>aka</em> BrazenBamboo). It remains an open question, however, as to whether the malware is distributed among other threat actor groups.</p>
<h3 id="detection-opportunities-2">Detection Opportunities</h3>
<p><strong>Network Comms</strong><br>
The malware communicates with a server located at <code>hxxps://103.27[.]109[.]217:52202</code>, which also hosts an administrator panel accessible on port 3458.</p>
<p><strong>File Artifacts</strong><br>
The modular malware consists of several parts, a dylib, multiple plugins and an initial dropper or loader. Known samples of the plugins contain a user file path artifact <code>/Users/air/work/</code> and researchers have provided a public YARA rule based on that here.</p>
<p>However, advanced threat actors are unlikely to re-use malware with publicly-exposed indicators of compromise and a reliable EDR solution is recommended for detection and protection.</p>

<h2 id="beavertail--contagious-interview-campaign-targets-job-seekers">BeaverTail | ‘Contagious Interview’ Campaign Targets Job Seekers</h2>
<p>BeaverTail is a cross-platform malware targeting macOS and Windows users and attributed to North Korean state-sponsored groups. The threat actors impersonate recruiters on platforms like LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and Freelancer, offering job opportunities to potential victims.</p>
<p>The fake recruiters guide targets into downloading and executing trojanized applications disguised as legitimate tools for job interviews or collaboration. Some researchers have labelled the campaign “Contagious Interview”, and it follows a similar playbook to earlier DPRK-attributed campaigns like “Operation In(ter)ception” and “Operation Dream Job”.</p>
<p>BeaverTail is developed using the Qt framework, enabling cross-platform compatibility for macOS and Windows systems. Legitimate applications that have been copied and trojanized include chat apps MiroTalk and FreeConference.</p>

<h2 id="todoswift--hidden-risk--dprk-campaigns-target-crypto-users">ToDoSwift &amp; Hidden Risk | DPRK Campaigns Target Crypto Users</h2>
<p>North Korean-aligned threat actors were also busy during 2024 attempting to steal cryptocurrency assets and compromise organizations and individuals involved in crypto trading and decentralized finance (DeFi). Two related campaigns were spotted by researchers and attributed to the BlueNoroff APT.</p>
<p>In August, researchers from Kandji described the ToDoSwift malware attributed to the threat actor. A signed and notarized macOS application named “Risk factors for Bitcoin’s price decline are emerging(2024).app”, uploaded to VirusTotal in July, downloads a decoy PDF named “Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning” from Google Drive. In the background a second-stage payload is downloaded from an actor-controlled domain at <code>buy2x[.]com</code>.</p>
<p>In September, the FBI and JAMF researchers warned of ongoing activity from North Korean-backed threat actors targeting the crypto sector. In November, SentinelLabs found that BlueNoroff had expanded its campaign and dubbed it ‘Hidden Risk’. Their analysis revealed how threat actors were using phishing emails with fake crypto news PDFs to trick recipients into downloading and executing a malicious Swift application. As with the earlier samples described by Kandji, these new samples were both code signed and notarized by Apple.</p>

<p>The app injects code into the host’s <code>zshenv</code> file to achieve persistence while downloading a second-stage from the actor-controlled domain <code>matuaner[.]com</code>. The second-stage is a backdoor that performs host reconnaissance and posts data to the C2 and contains functionality to execute shell commands received from the threat actor.</p>

<h2 id="hz-rat--macos-backdoor-targets-chat-app-users">HZ RAT | macOS Backdoor Targets Chat App Users</h2>
<p>In August, researchers from Kaspersky detailed a macOS version of a known Windows backdoor called HZ RAT. Distributed as a trojan pretending to be an OpenVPN Connect installer, HZ RAT attempts to steal data from the user’s DingTalk and WeChat installations.</p>
<p>The trojanized OpenVPN Connect installer contains two executables in its MacOS folder, <code>exe</code> and <code>init</code>. The first is simply a Bash script that runs the <code>init</code> file before launching the OpenVPN Connect application. The <code>init</code> file is the backdoor in the form of an Intel x86 Mach-O. On execution, it reaches out to a C2 based on a list of IP addresses hardcoded in the binary itself. The backdoor contains four commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute Shell Command</li>
<li>Write File to Disk</li>
<li>Send File to Server</li>
<li>Check Victim Availability</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the backdoor conducts host reconnaissance and collects user information from the WeChat and DingTalk applications, if installed. This includes the victim’s WeChatID, email, phone number, DingTalk organization, department, corporate email address and phone number. The backdoor also scrapes usernames and website values from the Google Password Manager.</p>

<h2 id="cloudchat-infostealer--chat-app-with-a-hidden-agenda">CloudChat Infostealer | Chat App with a Hidden Agenda</h2>
<p>In April, researchers found a website called CloudChat delivering a malicious application designed to infect macOS users with an infostealer.</p>
<p>The CloudChat disk image contains an application of the same name, which on execution calls the linked <code>libCloudchat.dylib</code> located in the bundle’s Frameworks folder to first check if the host’s IP is located in China. If it is not, the dylib attempts to download a file called <code>clip</code> via FTP. This file is then written to disk as a hidden file with the name <code>.Safari_V8_config</code> in the user’s Home directory and its com.apple.quarantine attribute is removed.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="notlockbit--macos-ransomware-is-edging-closer">NotLockBit | macOS Ransomware Is Edging Closer</h2>
<p>We still haven’t seen a full-scale ransomware campaign targeting Macs <em>en masse</em>, and perhaps we never will given the different use profile for Macs in the enterprise compared to Windows and Linux, but there’s no doubt that threat actors have been and continue to explore the possibilities.</p>
<p>With Macs far more vulnerable to data exfiltration than file locking, ransomware on macOS may never amount to much more than an after thought or decoy to hide other nefarious activities, but 2024 saw what looked very much like a threat actor working through the steps needed to deploy malware with both file locking and data exfiltration capabilities on macOS targets.</p>
<p>NotLockBit was initially reported by Trend Micro and expanded upon in further research by SentinelLabs, whose analysis showed how exfiltration functionality had been added to an evolving sample set.</p>
<p>NotLockBit is written in Go and is distributed as an x86_64 binary. On execution, the ransomware gathers system information and uses an embedded public key to generate a random master key for asynchronous file encryption. Encrypted files are appended with <code>.abcd</code> file extension and an appropriated LockBit 2.0 wallpaper is displayed on the user’s Desktop.</p>
<p>Prior to the file locking operation, the malware attempts to exfiltrate the user’s data to a remote AWS S3 cloud storage server using credentials hardcoded into the binary. The malware creates new repositories (‘buckets’) on the attacker’s Amazon S3 instance (now defunct).</p>

<p>As the name indicates, this ransomware does not emanate from the developers of the notorious LockBit malware, who themselves have experimented with macOS ransomware in the not too distant past, but presumably the real developers behind it figured that the LockBit wallpaper would either be useful for credibility and/or help misdirect attribution.</p>
<p>Importantly, these samples were not found in the wild and have not been associated with any distinct delivery method, and have no known victims. Still a proof-of-concept, perhaps, but given the work that has gone into these, it’s plausible to assume more are coming.</p>

<h2 id="cloudfake--malware-developers-adopt-tauri-development-environment">CloudFake | Malware Developers Adopt Tauri Development Environment</h2>
<p>Tauri is a recent cross-platform development framework designed to address some of the dissatisfactions with Electron. Like Electron, threat actors have found it useful for malicious purposes. The framework is distinctive in its use of web technologies for the front end and Rust for the back end.</p>
<p>In October, several researchers noted a fake Cloudflare Security Authenticator disk image on VirusTotal. The DMG contained a Tauri Mach-O binary called <code>cloudflare-auth-tauri</code>.</p>

<p>Researchers at Kandji explored the binary’s characteristics, noting that on execution it created and executed stage 2 and stage 3 Mach-O binaries out of <code>/private/tmp/</code>. The stage 3 sets up a crontab for persistence and downloads a fourth stage to the user’s Home directory as a hidden file with the name <code>.gp.</code> This final stage is a Go binary and appears to be a VShell sample – a cross-platform malware framework with C2 and evasion capabilities.</p>

<p>Tauri was also the development platform of choice for a DPRK-linked threat exposed in November. Researchers from Group-IB identified multiple signed and notarized (since revoked by Apple) applications that follow the now-familiar North Korean playbook of using decoy PDFs to backdoor target entities.</p>
<p>In this case, the dropper application leveraged extended attributes in an attempt to hide malicious code. Several applications with different display names but the same bundle ID, executable and code signature have been observed. Interestingly, although these applications are almost identical copies, the code hidden in the extended attributes can differ, although all observed instances use the same remote source, now offline, to retrieve the payload.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The threats seen in 2024 underline the growing focus on macOS as a viable target for sophisticated attacks on enterprises. While some malware families, like Amos Atomic, refined existing techniques, others, such as NotLockBit and CloudFake, hinted at new strategies in development.</p>
<p>Equally concerning is the increasing adoption of cross-platform development frameworks indicating that macOS compromise is being rolled into larger campaigns.</p>
<p>These trends suggest a deliberate effort by attackers to scale their operations while exploiting gaps in macOS defenses that are often overlooked in enterprise environments.</p>
<p>For security teams, the lessons from 2024 are clear: Proactive threat hunting, robust endpoint detection, and swift response capabilities are more critical than ever to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.</p>
