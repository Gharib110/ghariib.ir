<h5 id="rasberry-pi-b-arm-image-support">Rasberry Pi B+ ARM Image Support</h5>
<p>We are pleased to announce that we have updated our Raspberry Pi Kali image to support the new B+ model so that now it works out of the box. This single image now supports all Raspberry Pi models.</p>
<h5 id="odroid-u3-cubox-i-arm-images-added">Odroid U3, Cubox-i ARM Images Added</h5>
<p>We have also included two more images to our Kali ARM image collection for the Odroid U3 and Cubox-i ARM computers. Each of these have interesting use cases as both their small form factor and specs are formidable. All of these news scripts can be found in our <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">OffSec GitHub</a> page.</p>
<h5 id="new-kali-tools-website">New Kali Tools Website!</h5>
<p>After many months of typing, editing, and testing, we are delighted to announce the launch of our new <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali Linux Tools</a> website. This new site is our official home for information on all of the tools included in Kali Linux. For each tool, you will find a description of the tool, links to the tool homepage, author and license information, and usage output so you can see what output you can expect from each utility in Kali.</p>
<p>In addition to the primary listing of all <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali tools</a>, we have also made an effort to use tags throughout the site so you can more easily find a particular tool based on what it can do. You will find a tag cloud at the bottom of each page as you navigate the site. Also available is a full breakdown of the contents of each <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">Kali Linux metapackage</a>, allowing you to see which tool is included in a particular metapackage, which makes the building of <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">custom ISOs</a> much easier.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our new Kali Linux Tools site and find it as useful as we do. If you are a tool author and have additional examples that you would like us to include in order to more fully cover your project, please feel free to <a href="https://www.kali.org/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
<h5 id="looking-towards-the-future">Looking towards the future</h5>
<p>We have a massive set of of surprises in the works, some of which will be revealed in <a href="http://2014.brucon.org/index.php/Training_Kali_Linux_Dojo">Brucon</a> and <a href="https://www.derbycon.com/2014/08/11/kali-linux-dojo-at-derbycon/">Derbycon</a>, where weâ€™ll be running our second <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/">Kali Linux Dojo</a>. See you there!</p>
