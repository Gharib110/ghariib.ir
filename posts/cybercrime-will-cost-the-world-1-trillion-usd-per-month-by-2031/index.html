<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 31, 2025</p>
<p>The latest cybercrime damage cost predictions from Cybersecurity Ventures have been released at CybercrimeCost.com. For the first time, the figures are published in a chart (.pdf) with costs per year, month, week, hour, minute, and second, from 2015 to 2031.</p>
<p>The chart is designed to help reporters and journalists at media outlets to convey the past, present, and future of cybercrime for a certain time period. For instance, cybercrime will cost the world 1 trillion USD per month by 2031, up from around 1 trillion per year in 2020.</p>
<p>Cybercrime grew by 15 percent year-over-year from 2021 to 2025. The cybercrime growth rate from 2025 to 2031 is predicted to slow to 2.5 percent, similar to a large country GDP growth rate. Cybersecurity product innovation and maturity, AI tools, and other factors contribute to the slower cybercrime growth rate – which nonetheless remains one of the greatest threats to humanity.</p>
<p>“If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third largest economy, behind the U.S. and China,” says Steve Morgan, founder of Cybersecurity Ventures and Editor-in-Chief at Cybercrime Magazine.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures will follow up later in Q1 with supportive information around its cybercrime damage costs predictions.</p>
