			<h1>Task scams surge by 400%, but what are they?</h1>

				<p>An unfamiliar type of scam has surged against everyday people, with a year-over-year increase of some 400%, putting job seekers at risk of losing their time and money.</p>
<p>The emerging threat is delivered in “task scams” or “gamified job scams.” While these scams were virtually non-existent in 2020, the FTC reported 5,000 cases in 2023 and a whopping 20,000 cases in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>In these scams, online criminals prey on people looking for remote jobs by offering them simple repetitive tasks such as liking videos, optimizing apps, boosting product interest, or rating product images. These tasks are usually organized in sets of 40 tasks that will take the victim to a “next level” once they are completed.</p>
<p>Sometimes the victim will get a so-called double task that earns a bigger commission. The trick is that the scammers will make the victim think they are earning money to raise trust in the system. The money can be fake and only displayed in the system, but some victims report actually receiving small sums.</p>
<p>But at some point, the scammers will tell the victims, they have to make a deposit to get the next set of tasks or get your earnings out of the app. So, victims are likely to make that deposit, or all their work will have been for naught.</p>
<p>Scammers use cryptocurrency like USDT (a digital stable-coin with a value tied to the value of the US dollar) to make their payments.</p>
<p>Task scams typically begin with unsolicited text messages or messages via platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, or other messaging apps. These messages often come from unknown numbers or profiles that may appear professional to gain trust. Reportedly, these scams like to impersonate legitimate companies such as Deloitte, Amazon, McKinsey and Company, and Airbnb.</p>
<p>Scammers count on the urge that victims do not want to “cut their losses” and will try to pull victims in even deeper, sometimes inviting them into groups where newcomers can learn and hear success stories from (fake) experienced workers.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-task-scams">How to avoid task scams</h2>
<p>Once you know the red flags, it is easier to shy away from task scams.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not respond to unsolicited job offers via text messages or messaging apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never pay to get paid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify the legitimacy of the employer through official channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t trust anyone who offers to pay you for something illegal such as rating or liking things online.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that legitimate employers do not ask employees to pay for the opportunity to work. And as with most scams, if it sound to good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>If you run into a task scam, please report them to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. </p>
