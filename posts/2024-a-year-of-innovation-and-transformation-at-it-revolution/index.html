				<p>As we reflect on 2024, we’re proud to share a year marked by groundbreaking publications, evolving events, and continued commitment to helping technology leaders succeed. This year saw us not only expand our publishing portfolio in innovative ways but also embrace meaningful change in how we serve our community.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll take a moment to catch up on all the things we accomplished this year and look forward to what we have planned for 2025.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-our-flagship-event"><strong>Evolution of Our Flagship Event</strong></h2>
<h3 id="enterprise-technology-leadership-summit"><strong>Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit</strong></h3>
<p>2024 marked a significant evolution as we rebranded our DevOps Enterprise Summit to the <strong>Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit</strong>. This change reflects the broader scope our community has developed over the past decade. As Gene Kim noted, “It’s about culture-creating learning organizations and employee engagement. It’s about using technology to win.”</p>
<p>The Las Vegas event brought together senior technology leaders at the director, VP, and principal engineer levels as well as individual contributors, consultants, and more. The programming centered around three key objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Experience reports from technology leaders on improving their sociotechnical systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject matter expertise sharing, with a significant focus on GenAI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career advice for both technology leaders and their teams.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The summit showcased groundbreaking talks across multiple domains: from Vanguard’s enterprise-wide GenAI experimentation and Adobe’s AI governance approach to Cisco’s security portfolio integration, complemented by insights from industry experts like Shawn “Swyx” Wang and DevOps pioneer Patrick Debois. </p>
<p>Transformative experience reports included Mike Carr’s “one team” collaboration at Vanguard, Lauren Woods’ leadership principles as Southwest Airlines’ CIO, Jason Cox’s innovative SRE agency model at Disney, and SiriusXM’s successful streaming platform transformation. </p>
<p>Expert sessions rounded out the program, featuring ADM John Richardson on leadership trust, Manuel Pais and Dr. Laura Weis on team dynamics, Jon Smart on management method patterns, and a special celebration of the DORA report’s 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>Our European virtual summit complemented these offerings, delivering high-impact learning and networking opportunities across European time zones.</p>
<h2 id="groundbreaking-publications"><strong>Groundbreaking Publications</strong></h2>
<h3 id="the-phoenix-project-graphic-novel-from-prose-to-panels"><strong>The Phoenix Project Graphic Novel: From Prose to Panels</strong></h3>
<p>One of our most ambitious and exciting projects this year was transforming <em>The Phoenix Project</em> into a graphic novel. This labor of love has taken over a year to complete and required assembling an exceptional creative team, including veteran illustrator from DC and Marvel, Mike Collins. This new format makes the book’s crucial lessons about IT management and DevOps accessible to an even broader audience, bringing the world of Parts Unlimited to life through dynamic illustrations and careful attention to visual storytelling.</p>
<p>The transformation process was both challenging and illuminating. We adopted an agile, iterative approach, working in small batches to gather feedback and refine our process. The team evolved from detailed DC-style scripts to looser Marvel-style storytelling, learning to “trust our visual partner.” Every aspect required careful consideration, from character design (like Bill’s chiseled jaw) to technical details like distinguishing between “IT” and “it” in the all-caps lettering style. You can read more about the process here.</p>
<p>Volume 1’s release just a few weeks ago represents just the beginning. Two more volumes are planned for 2025 to complete this text-to-visual transformation. </p>
<h3 id="flow-engineering-mastering-complexity"><strong>Flow Engineering: Mastering Complexity</strong></h3>
<p>In <strong>Flow Engineering: From Value Stream Mapping to Effective Action</strong>, Steve Pereira and Andrew Davis introduced a revolutionary approach to handling today’s business complexity. This groundbreaking work provides a lightweight, iterative practice for building value, clarity, and flow in organizational collaboration. The book introduces five key mapping techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Outcome Mapping for alignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value Stream Mapping for constraint identification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependency Mapping for root cause analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future State Mapping for workflow improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flow Roadmapping for actionable planning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This people-centered approach empowers teams to visualize workflows and co-construct solutions, putting transformation power where it belongs—in the hands of practitioners.</p>
<h3 id="unbundling-the-enterprise-digital-innovation"><strong>Unbundling the Enterprise: Digital Innovation</strong></h3>
<p>Stephen Fishman and Matt McLarty’s <strong>Unbundling the Enterprise: API’s, Optionality &amp; the Science of Happy Accidents</strong> introduced the concept of finding “digital treasure” through the “science of happy accidents.” The book reveals how leading companies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating optionality through modular, API-first architectures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying opportunities through value dynamics mapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimizing value through rapid experimentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors draw on examples from companies like Coca-Cola, Capital One, and Best Buy to show how organizations can adopt a venture capital approach to digital innovation.</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-technology-leadership-journal-advancing-the-field"><strong>Enterprise Technology Leadership Journal: Advancing the Field</strong></h3>
<p>This year also marked an important evolution in our journal offerings as we rebranded the DevOps Enterprise Journal to the Enterprise Technology Leadership Journal. This biannual publication serves as a crucial platform for sharing cutting-edge research, insights, and best practices from industry experts and thought leaders.</p>
<p>Each edition combines theoretical frameworks with practical guidance and case studies, serving as an invaluable resource for technology leaders navigating the rapidly evolving digital landscape. The journal’s emphasis on adapting to new technologies while maintaining robust governance and security practices has made it a cornerstone publication for senior technology leaders, executives, and practitioners. </p>
<p>You can download the 2024 Spring and Fall volumes for free.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward-to-2025"><strong>Looking Forward to 2025</strong></h2>
<p>As IT Revolution enters its next decade, we’re expanding our offerings to meet the evolving needs of technology leaders. Our initiatives for 2025 include:</p>
<h3 id="expanded-learning-opportunities"><strong>Expanded Learning Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>We’re significantly growing our Immersion Courses, which offer on-demand, in-depth learning experiences taught by IT Revolution authors and industry experts.

<h3 id="etls-connect-events"><strong>ETLS Connect Events</strong></h3>
<p>In October 2024, we successfully launched our ETLS Connect events program with our inaugural virtual session, featuring global watch parties in New York, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Cologne, Berlin, and Leeds. These quarterly, half-day virtual events are designed to foster ongoing learning and community engagement. The format has proven highly effective in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Facilitating focused discussions on leadership, technology, and business transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating themed events covering GenAI, government and defense, and platform engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling global participation through watch parties hosted by Equal Experts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining digital talks with in-person networking opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building on this success, we’re excited to continue the program in 2025 with upcoming sessions scheduled for February 26 and June 4.</p>
