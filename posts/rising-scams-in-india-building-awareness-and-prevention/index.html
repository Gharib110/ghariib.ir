<h3 id="1whatsapp-scam">1.WhatsApp Scam:</h3>
<p><strong>Scam Tactics:</strong></p>
<p>Fraudsters on WhatsApp employ deceptive tactics to steal personal information, financial data, or gain unauthorized access to accounts. Common tactics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing Links</strong>: Messages with fake links mimicking trusted organizations, urging users to verify their accounts or claim rewards.<br>
<strong><em>Example</em>****:</strong> “Your account will be deactivated! Click here to verify your number now.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +244 country code, assigned to Angola. The message offers an unrealistic investment opportunity promising a high return in just four days, which is a common scam tactic. It uses pressure and informal language, along with a link for immediate action.</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +261 country code, assigned to Madagascar. The message claims that you have been hired and asks you to click a link to view the offer or contact the sender which is a scam.</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impersonation</strong>: Scammers hijack or mimic contacts to ask for urgent financial help.<br>
<strong><em>Example</em>****:</strong> “Hey, it’s me! I lost my wallet. Can you send me ₹5,000?”</li>
<li><strong>Fake Job Offers</strong>: Messages promising high earnings from home to lure victims into scams.<br>
<strong><em>Example</em>****:</strong> “Earn ₹10,000 daily! Contact us to start now!”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case 3:</strong> In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +91 country code, assigned to India. Scammers may contact you, posing as representatives of a legitimate company, offering a job opportunity. The recruiter offers an unrealistic daily income (INR 2000–8000) for vague tasks like searching keywords, which is suspicious. Despite requests, they fail to provide official company details or an email ID, raising credibility concerns. They also ask for personal information prematurely, a common red flag.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p><strong>Case 4:</strong> In the figure below, a user is being deceived by a message originating from the +84 country code, assigned to Vietnam. The offer to earn money by watching a video for just a few seconds and providing a screenshot is a common tactic used by scammers to exploit individuals. They may use the link to gather personal information, or your action could lead to phishing attempts.</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p><strong>Case 5:</strong> In the figure below, a user is being misled by a message originating from the country codes +91, +963, and +27, corresponding to India, Syria, and South Africa, respectively. The message claims to offer a part-time job with a high salary for minimal work, which is a common tactic used by scammers to lure individuals. The use of popular names like “Amazon” and promises of easy money are red flags. The link provided might lead to phishing attempts or data theft. It’s important not to click on any links, share personal details, or respond to such unsolicited offers.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p><strong>Case 6:</strong> The messages encourage you to post fake 5-star reviews for businesses in exchange for a small payment, which is unethical and often illegal. Scammers use such tactics to manipulate online ratings, and the provided links could lead to phishing sites or malware. Avoid engaging with these messages, clicking on the links, or participating in such activities.</p>
