				<p>Apple has released a host of security updates across many devices, including for a zero-day bug which is being actively exploited in iOS.</p>
<p>Apple said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Devices affected are those that run:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>iPhone XS and later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS Sequoia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple Watch Series 6 and later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All models of Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use any of these then you should install updates as soon as you can. To check if you’re using the latest software version, go to <strong>Settings</strong> (or <strong>System Settings</strong>) &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Software Update</strong>. It’s also worth turning on Automatic Updates if you haven’t already, which you can do on the same screen.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details-about-the-zero-day">Technical details about the zero-day</h2>
<p>The zero-day vulnerability patched in this update is tracked as CVE-2025-24085. It is described as a use after free (UAF) issue in Apple’s Core Media framework that would allow an attacker to elevate privileges.</p>
<p>The Core Media framework handles multimedia applications like photos, videos, and real-time communication applications. UAF is a type of vulnerability that is the result of the incorrect use of dynamic memory during a program’s operation. If, after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker can use the error to manipulate the program. Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code. In this case, successful exploitation could provide a malicious app with privileges on the affected device that it shouldn’t have.</p>
