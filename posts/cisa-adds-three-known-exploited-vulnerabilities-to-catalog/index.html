			<h1>CISA Adds Three Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog</h1>
			<b><time>08.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
		       

			<div>
				<p>CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-41713 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal Vulnerability</li>
<li>CVE-2024-55550 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal Vulnerability</li>
<li>CVE-2020-2883 Oracle WebLogic Server Unspecified Vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>Users and administrators are also encouraged to review the Palo Alto Threat Brief: Operation Lunar Peek related to CVE-2024-0012, the Palo Alto Security Bulletin for CVE-2024-0012, and the Palo Alto Security Bulletin for CVE-2024-9474 for additional information. </p>
<p>These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.</p>
<p>Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.</p>
